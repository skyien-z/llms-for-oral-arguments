The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party. I look forward to this Court\\'s questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You --can a consent decree or a default judgment support a prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court\\'s precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they\\'re both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff\\'s favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that\\'s correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it\\'s either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a \"prevailing party\" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn\\'t fit under the \"prevailing party\" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don\\'t --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don\\'t know what that would be. Like, they\\'re  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven\\'t gotten a final judgment, but they don\\'t need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it\\'s not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there\\'s been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff\\'s claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn\\'t ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that\\'s required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn\\'t been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don\\'t know why a preliminary injunction doesn\\'t do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there\\'s been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there\\'s been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that\\'s the only thing that\\'s required by law to get that relief. That\\'s winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it\\'s improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it\\'s  --it\\'s simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it\\'s  -- it\\'s true that it\\'s only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who\\'s going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it\\'s  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas\\'s first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It\\'s kind of like a \"we give up,\" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially \"we give up\" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn\\'t fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don\\'t think it\\'s correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that\\'s equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney\\'s fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it\\'s not that determination that\\'s making them subject to the attorney\\'s fees, right?  I mean, what  --what\\'s making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don\\'t know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant\\'s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don\\'t understand why a preliminary injunction couldn\\'t satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we\\'re talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That\\'s what we\\'ve said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it\\'s not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it\\'s not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court\\'s initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court\\'s ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice\\'s example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn\\'t violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn\\'t Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they\\'re a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that\\'s combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that\\'s dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we\\'ve  -- you know, we\\'re facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney\\'s fees, so let\\'s just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it\\'s not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn\\'t the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn\\'t a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn\\'t the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they\\'ve won the only thing that\\'s been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature\\'s decision to repeal a statute shouldn\\'t be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs\\' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I\\'m having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn\\'t the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it\\'s not automatically granted. There\\'s discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it\\'s not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature\\'s repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we\\'ve -- we\\'ve said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn\\'t get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you\\'re still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word \"all,\" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there\\'s been no actual determination on the merits, and there\\'s been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you\\'re the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney\\'s fees, don\\'t you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don\\'t know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn\\'t that a bad consequence of the position you\\'re advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner\\'s rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents\\' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it\\'s true that Petitioner\\'s rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant\\'s going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn\\'t continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that\\'s -- that\\'s not the defendant, and it usually hasn\\'t been attributed to the defendant. If you\\'re talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it\\'s done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won\\'t be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you\\'re saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren\\'t comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs\\' favor. So I don\\'t think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don\\'t think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.

I welcome the Court\\'s questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Do you think that the statutes in which Congress requires that there be a final order before you can -- before you can have a prevailing party, do you think that\\'s just simply superfluous?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No. No, I don\\'t  --I don\\'t. There\\'s only one statute, by the way, that predates Section 1988. It\\'s Section 1617, which is discussed by the Court in Bradley. All  that does is clarifies that you don\\'t need a true final judgment that ends the case. A final judgment normally is one that resolves all  claims and ceases to terminate -- terminates the case. In the context of -- of Section 1617, that\\'s in the context of school desegregation injunctive orders, and in that context, you often will have a final order, which is a  -- you know, even if it doesn\\'t resolve all claims, but it\\'s final, it\\'s on the merits, you\\'re granting relief on the merits, but the injunction may need to be tweaked as we go along because just any kind of complicated institutional injunction is going to have to be tweaked. That\\'s all Section 1617 requires. It does not depart -- it does not change the normal understanding of \"prevailing party,\" which a prevailing party is one who succeeds at the end of the case because they obtain judgment on at least one claim.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counsel  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say, if I understand it, you don\\'t have to get final judgment on all the claims, right?  You just need to prevail on one. Now, if you prevail on  one, can you get the attorney fees that are associated with 2, 3, and 4?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No. The question -- there\\'s multiple questions in attorney\\'s fees cases. The first is whether you\\'re a prevailing party. You have to succeed on at least one claim on the merits to be prevailing.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> The question then goes to how much fees. That\\'s a  --usually, it\\'s a reasonable fee award. And the reasonableness of the fees, you -- you would look more granularly to determine whether the case -- the issues were intertwined or not. If they\\'re completely separate issues and you lost on them, generally, no, you don\\'t get fees for those.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> What do you do with the case that Justice Jackson posed, which is common?  I want to -- I want to participate in this protest, this parade  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and only the passage of time moots the case. You\\'ve gotten all your relief. Nothing you\\'ve done or someone else has done has changed it. You got all the relief you really wanted. I wanted to protest.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, you did not get relief on the merits. Now I think a lot of the questions have --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> We -- we keep going back to the operative question here, which is we repeatedly said you don\\'t need a final judgment. You don\\'t need a determination o f the merits. You can have a consent judgment. You can have this. There has to be  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> I don\\'t think that\\'s quite</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- a different sense.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- I don\\'t think that\\'s quite right. The legislative history says you don\\'t need a final judgment following a full trial on the merits. That means you can get a final judgment at an earlier stage through summary judgment before you go to trial, through, for instance, a  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That\\'s not a final judgment. You get a judgment --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, summary judgment is a final judgment.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Not until you appeal it. Not until the whole case is litigated. You get a judgment but not final judgment.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> If sum  --if the court grants summary judgment, it is a final judgment if it\\'s on all the claims.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That\\'s the  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> If it\\'s summary judgment on part of the claims, then it\\'s subject to revision, so it\\'s not truly final. If it\\'s  -- if it\\'s injunctive and you grant summary judgment and then award injunctive relief, well, that\\'s final because you\\'re actually awarding merits relief at that point.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So, for example, the Chief -- Chief Justice\\'s hypothetical, after the parade, I could ask for a trial on the merits in -- in accompanying the PI and a final judgment could be issued at that time?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That\\'s correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That happens all the time. It happens from --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It happens  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And  --and --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- but sometimes it doesn\\'t because it\\'s the court --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and sometimes it doesn\\'t because I might want to go ahead and litigate it because I\\'m concerned about the same thing in the future and I might want, for example, a declaratory judgment, and I -- I could issue  -- I could --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Or the parade may be annual.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It may be annual.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> A lot of these parades are annual parades.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And I want a prospective injunction going forward.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And then we would have a final judgment on the merits  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- on at least that claim on which you would be prevailing, right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct. Correct. And I -- and I also want to address just a more general point, which is some of the questions were like:  Well, the fees have been incurred, we\\'ve got to allocate them. You know, who do  we allocate them to?  Well, that\\'s answered by the American rule. The American rule is each party, win or lose, bears their own fees. And this Court has made clear that you need express statutory authority to depart from that rule. And the statutory --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --and isn\\'t that the statute we\\'re talking about here? Right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, the statute uses a term of art that\\'s existed in statutes since at least -- the American statute since at least 1853.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but it is  -- it is addressing -- it is trying, Congress, to give us an exception to the American rule, and the question is what is the scope of that exception.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But Congress didn\\'t go all the way. Congress adopted a term of art which had  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Prevailing party.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- a settled meaning.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask about Justice Gorsuch\\'s example?  What if I don\\'t want to spend the time and additional money to litigate this through to a declaratory judgment or a future?  What if I just want to march in  the parade tomorrow?  I\\'m a religious organization, for example. I don\\'t  --you know, I agree with traditional marriage, and tomorrow is the LGBTQ parade and I want to march in it. I want to be able to be there. I  -- I\\'m not making a whole thing out of it.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I -- I get that. I go to court and I argue the merits of my entitlement  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to be able to do that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And the court says, as a preliminary matter, we don\\'t have a whole trial yet, I think you\\'re going to win, so I\\'m giving you an injunction and you get to march in the parade.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And I do.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then I\\'m done. I say the case is mooted because, really, the relief that I wanted was the ability to march in the parade tomorrow. But I did have to pay an attorney to be able to convince you, court, to give me the relief that I requested. I --I guess I don\\'t understand why, under our formulation of the test for a prevailing party in the Lefemine case, what we say  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That was a permanent injunction, and --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand it was a permanent injunction in that case, but I\\'m asking you, we set up a test for when you are a prevailing party, and the question is why doesn\\'t that test also cover preliminary injunctions like the one that I talked about.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Part of that test is a judgment on the merits, and a judge  -- this is not  -- a preliminary injunction is a tentative determination that does not control anything later in the suit. It\\'s only for the PI stage,  only to adjust the parties\\' relationships during the suit.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Mr. Yang, does any  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And this is important.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Ms. Maley said that she didn\\'t know of a circuit that it accept ed -- that had accepted this categorical position, if it\\'s a preliminary injunction, there are no fees. Do you know of any circuit that\\'s accepted this categorical position?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, that was the Smyth rule prior to.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Yeah, prior to it being changed, and  --and so now --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, but this Court granted cert on unanimous --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- so now there\\'s -- there\\'s a uniform rule. You don\\'t know of anything  --any court that\\'s gone the other way. You know what?  It\\'s an interesting thing. It seems that this comes up all the time, and it seems as though it\\'s come up frequently just in recent years. When I was talking to my clerks about this, you know, several had confronted this issue with respect to COVID litigation, where  people went to courts and they asked for injunctions from various kinds of COVID policies, and then, you know, in the end, those  policies were changed or were scrapped or were abandoned in some way. So it seems as though there\\'s quite a lot of recent law that cuts against you here from circuits, like, pretty much all across the U.S.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the circuits are not uniform. Some of them look to -- for instance, the Fifth Circuit looks to why the -- the mooting event occurred, but my -- my point -- I want to make two points. One, this Court already addressed the strategic mootness question in Buckhannon and  -- and  -- and addressed that in four different factors. There\\'s two other factors. I want to address two of those first and then I\\'ll go to Buckhannon. One is that Congress has struck a balance here, that there is reason for caution before abandoning what this Court has described as the crucial connection between liability for a violation of federal law on the merits, finding on the merits that you violated federal law, and attorney\\'s fees, and there\\'s reason to -- to give pause before doing that. Congress has sometimes been more generous with the government, but these -- this case -- this statute covers both private individuals and non-federal actors. Secondly, going to Buckhannon, the cost  --there\\'s a cost of deterring federal government action from being voluntarily changed when it may be lawful. Litigation often puts a spotlight on a practice that might not be the best policy even though it\\'s lawful, and the Court in Buckhannon recognized there is a cost to deterring that kind of good government change. Secondly --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Okay. I don\\'t think that that\\'s what I was asking about. I was asking really, you know, do you have any law out there on your side?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> We have a term of art that has gone back --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, what  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- in this Court\\'s decisions, and -- and I think that the courts of appeals just have not been faithful to this Court\\'s decisions.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, that  -- that raises the question for me, why -- why do you think they\\'ve been not seeing the light?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, I think sometimes there\\'s  -- as a policy matter, you might decide, hey, you know, this  -- this --I don\\'t like this outcome. I think some of the courts  -- and -- and I acknowledge that there might be some cases like that. But that type of policy call is for Congress to make. So, in Buckhannon, when the Court rejected the catalyst theory, Justice Ginsburg dissented and said:  Hey, look, there\\'s one specific area that\\'s really problematic, FOIA. Congress reacted and did a targeted response to This really goes to the appropriate separation of powers here. Congress adopts a  statute that has a term of art that goes back quite some time. This Court has repeatedly  determined that merits determination, you know, a determination of liability on the merits is crucial to then make  --making the defendant liable for fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Congress --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> The Respondents argue that there is a historical background of a venerable equitable tradition of awarding interim costs, including for a preliminary injunction, and that, if accepted, would perhaps undercut your historical argument. Do you want to say something about that?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> There\\'s two points I would love to make about that. First, this -- this Court already resolved that argument in Alyeska Pipeline. There was a  --and it was actually Justice Marshall\\'s dissent, which was based on equitable principles. What the Court decided in Alyeska Pipeline is that the American rule is each party bears its own costs. There are certain discrete common law exceptions that have evolved. At equity, for instance, the common fund exception,  you get a fund. It would be unjustly  -- you would unjustly enrich the people who benefit unless they pay your fees. That\\'s a fee-sharing, not fee-shifting. Bad faith attorney\\'s fees is another one. Contempt fees is another exception. But the Court did not say equity, you know, it\\'s all -- you know, whatever you think is equitable. The Court recognized that there are very discrete limits. And I think that\\'s illustrated by the only case that they cite, the only case that they cite as  --as supporting a PI fee award, and that\\'s Clancy versus Geb. In that case, it was not based on the temporary injunction that was issued on the day the suit was filed. The court said it was based on the trial on the merits that sustained the cause of action for an injunction. Now, after the trial on the merits, the court didn\\'t grant further injunctive relief, and that might be a problem, but it certainly does not  stand for the proposition that a TRO or, you know -- or a PI gets you prevailing party status. There was a final adjudication on the merits of the -- of the cause of action.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Just to be clear, Buckhannon, there was no court -ordered relief whatsoever, correct?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That\\'s true. That\\'s true.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as I read the decision, that was mostly the focus of the decision?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, certainly, the catalyst theory was  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It was the prime focus.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- but the catalyst --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- theory does not -- we\\'re not escaping the catalyst theory here because  the catalyst theory is embedded in this case. It is the second -- it is what happened with this case after --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you\\'re  -- you\\'re -- you\\'re claiming there is no catalyst theory because you\\'re saying the legislature acted -- or the other side is saying it acted independently, so it -- it has nothing to do --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the catalyst theory was rejected in Buckhannon.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> They\\'re saying it doesn\\'t matter why the case ends. It just ended with a judgment, dismissal of the action. It could be for mootness. It could be because the other side gave up. I got what I came for at least in part. I got my license back. I drove for 16 months. I didn\\'t have to pay anybody to get my license back. I won for those  --that part of my relief. And it\\'s never been dissolved, reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But that\\'s not what the term \"prevailing party\" has been understood, either by this Court or by the dictionary definitions that date back from before the -- the  -- the 20th Century. That has required a final adjudication  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well, that\\'s the problem. No, it\\'s never required a final adjudication. It\\'s required a judgment but not a final one.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it has. I mean, even  --even the legislative history -- this Court in Hanrahan discussed the legislative history. It\\'s all in dicta, but it discussed the legislative history of Section 1988, and what  --the conclusion the Court drew was that interim fees, meaning before the case is finally over, only -- were available only when the party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of its claims. And that happens when you get a final determination, maybe not a final judgment because you\\'re not resolving all claims or maybe because there\\'s some ongoing litigation about the nature of the injunctive relief.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Yang. We -- we have a difference of opinion on what finality means. If all you\\'re seeking  is a preliminary injunction, that\\'s final for that purpose.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> You don\\'t  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That  -- that\\'s the problem we\\'re having.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --file suits for preliminary injunctions. You file suits for  equitable relief, a judgment at the end of the suit. A preliminary injunction is a preliminary matter that protects the parties while the suit is adjudicated.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Let me see if I\\'ve got it. So a PI can\\'t be the basis for a  --a -- an award of fees under this statute because Sole basically says you have to look at what happens afterwards. And for all the reasons you just gave, a PI is a PI. It\\'s preliminary. It\\'s not  --okay. All right. Fine. Now  -- so we have to look what happened afterwards. And, here, what happened afterwards is plaintiffs may well have convinced  the Virginia state legislature to change their mind in a catalyst sort of way.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> The problem is Buckhannon says that doesn\\'t work either.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. But Justice Ginsburg in Buckhannon says, hey, Congress should fix that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And Congress did fix it in FOIA --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yep.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and said involuntary  -- voluntary cessation and changes, you still get fees. But --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So long as it\\'s not an insubstantial claim.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So quite generous, with the government\\'s money, of course. You know, it\\'s quite different when we\\'re talking about privat e litigants and non-federal. I think Congress might be more reticent to creating such a generous departure from even the prevailing party standard, but it could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And it hasn\\'t here.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> End of case. That\\'s your theory of the case?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That\\'s our theory.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. Got it.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I think, when the red light went on, you were in the middle of a really brilliant answer about Buckhannon. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And do you want to finish that answer?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Like a  --like a preliminary injunction, it was fleeting. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And I\\'m not sure that I recall the brilliance that was --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, I will look at the transcript and fill it in, so okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the  -- you know, I was just going to try to talk about strategic mootness maybe a little bit. Maybe that\\'s where  we were going. And, you know --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Sure.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- strategic mootness, as my  -- my  --my colleague has already answered, you\\'ve got a voluntary cessation barrier, which, you know, in your decision in Fikre, Justice Gorsuch, it\\'s a pretty formidable burden.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I hope so. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it -- it\\'s a formidable burden. Damages awards, never going to moot out. And it\\'s entirely speculative what effect this is going to have. That\\'s what Buckhannon said. Like, it\\'s not speculative whether it\\'s going to deter counsel or not. And I think this illustrates that. There\\'s no data to show this. This case was started when Smyth was the rule. They had no reason to expect any attorney\\'s fees from a PI, but they took the case. So it\\'s a little hard to say, like, there\\'s this compelling case that, like, we\\'re going to have a  -- a --a crash in civil rights, civil rights era. And there\\'s a real cost, again, to determining  -- to deterring the government from changing course when the action might be lawful but bad policy.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. That\\'s good enough. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So here\\'s the problem that I\\'m having with your statement of the case as you summarized with Justice Gorsuch. It\\'s that it begins with Sole says that a PI doesn\\'t count because you have to look at what happens afterwards. I\\'m reading from Sole. \"We express no view on whether, in the absence of a final decision on the merits of a claim for permanent relief, success in gaining a preliminary injunction may sometimes warrant an award of counsel fees.\"</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So I don\\'t know how you can start your case with the premise that Sole stands for the proposition that if you win a preliminary injunction, you have to get to final judgment in order to be entitled to  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it\\'s true  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- counsel fees.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --that the Court reserved that, but the Court also did say that it recognized that a preliminary injunction was just the initial salvo. As I stated in my intro, it\\'s  -- the tentative character makes a fee request at that initial stage premature.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It did not say \"premature.\"</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It says, \"Wyner is not a prevailing party, we conclude, for her initial victory was ephemeral.\"  And it was ephemeral in that case because it happened to go on and get reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It\\'s on page 84 of the Court\\'s opinion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> \"The tentative  character would have made the fee request at this initial stage premature.\"</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> \"The tentative character\" --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Of the PI.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- \"would have made\" -- yes, but it also says:  \"We express no view as to whether or not that tentative character in  PI is enough to make you a prevailing party.\"</text><speaker>Anthony A.
