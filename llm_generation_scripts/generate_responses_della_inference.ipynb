Below is an opening statement from a Supreme Court case and the name of a specific justice. Your task is to generate a list of questions that this justice is likely to ask in response to the opening statement. These questions should reflect the justiceâ€™s known priorities, jurisprudence, and typical questioning style, and they should be directly relevant to the arguments presented in the opening statement.\n",

A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies. Legal dictionaries at the time Congress enacted Section 1988 defined  \"prevailing party\" based on whether the party had successfully maintained its claim, looking to the end of the suit, not on its degree of success at earlier stages.
