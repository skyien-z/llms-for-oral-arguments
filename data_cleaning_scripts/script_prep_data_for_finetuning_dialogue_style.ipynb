      "\n",
      "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In section 233(a), Congress extended an absolute immunity to officers and employees of the Public Health Service. That provision, reflecting Congress's policy judgment that the immunity was necessary to revitalize the Public Health Service, makes a claim against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act the exclusive remedy for injury or death resulting from the performance of medical or related functions and precludes any other civil action or proceeding against the individuals by reason of the same subject matter. Without grappling with the language of section 233(a), Respondents have tried in a number of different ways to imply a limitation into the test for constitutional claims, but none of those arguments creates any ambiguity in the statute, for three reasons. First, the Bivens exception, found in the Westfall Act itself, applies only to the immunity set forth in the Westfall Act and says nothing about the scope of the entirely separate and distinct immunity set forth in section 233.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_ruth_bader_ginsburg<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_ruth_bader_ginsburg<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Including the Public Health Service.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that's correct. Public Health Service employees can take advantage both of the immunities set forth in the Westfall Act and also of the separate, preexisting, more specific immunity that's afforded to them by section 233(a). And this Court's decision in Smith, I think, made clear that those two immunities can coexist. There's no conflict between them. And what this Court said in Smith is that the Westfall Act immunity adds to the prior immunity, and employees can take advantage of both of them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_sonia_sotomayor<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Counsel, our job is to determine Congress's intent when it passed 233(a). What we do know is that there was no Bivens immunity at the time; the FTCA had only a limited application under certain driver-related accidents. So we really don't have anything to tell us, because they didn't even know that there was a constitutional claim that could be raised, what they would have intended or not intended. And I thought that Justice Ginsburg's point would be that the Westfall Act tells us what they intended, because by its nature it applied to all employees and didn't differentiate among them, and copied 233's immunity, so that one can look at it and say, ah, that speaks of Congress's intent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, certainly it's true that when Congress enacted the Westfall Act it could have broadly said, for instance, notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal employee shall assert a statutory immunity to constitutional claims. But it didn't do that. It did something much more narrow than that, which is that what it said was in section 2679(b)(2), paragraph (1) -- the immunity for Federal employees that was just set forth shall not apply to constitutional claims. And that's--<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_sonia_sotomayor<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "There are a number of them, Your Honor. Most of them apply to Federal medical workers, although not all of them. There is 10 U.S.C. section 1089, the Gonzalez Act, which is discussed in our brief and in the government's brief, which applies to Army doctors. There are statutes applying to NASA doctors, to Veterans Administration doctors, to certain medical volunteers. So there are a number of these statutes passed over a period of several decades.

      "But it seems to me that, quite apart from the Westfall Act, there's a more -- more basic answer that you would make to Justice Sotomayor's question.

If I made that answer, do you have authority I could cite for that proposition?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",

But I think it's true, certainly, that -- it's true that Congress, when it passed section 233, didn't know for sure that there was going to be a Bivens cause of action that was going to be allowed. But it spoke very broadly. It said \"any other civil action or proceeding. \" And when it did that, it surely meant civil actions or proceedings that were created by the courts at some later point in time as well as those that existed at the time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_anthony_m_kennedy<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "\n",
      "Exactly, Your Honor. And I think the problem with the interpretation that makes the interpretation of the statute depend on the timing of the Bivens decision is pointed up by two different statutory provisions and the odd results that you would have. One is that the Gonzalez Act, which I referred to earlier -- it's 10 U.S.C. section 1089 -- was enacted in 1976, it has immunity-conferring language that's extremely similar to the immunity-conferring language of section 233(a). In fact, we know that when Congress enacted the Gonzalez Act, it looked at and thought about section 233(a), and yet if it mattered whether Bivens had yet been decided, the Gonzalez Act would bar Bivens claims, but 233(a) wouldn't, even though you can't make that kind of distinction based on their text.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_antonin_scalia<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Of course, I don't look to see what Congress intended. I look to see what the statute says.

The text says what it says.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "--that results from the same subject matter. And I think one thing that's important is that \"subject matter\" here clearly means the same set of facts or the same set of circumstances. So that, it -- it's not the case that you only get immunity where your cause of action is somehow similar to the cause of action you have under the FTCA. If you -- you get immunity if you have any claim against the individuals that comes out of the -- the same set of facts, even if it were true that there was some requirement of an FTCA remedy, which we don't believe there is. And what's absolutely clear here as well is that Respondents do have an FTCA remedy against the United States. They have brought an FTCA claim against the United States. The United States has admitted liability on that claim. That's found at page 328 of the Joint Appendix. And so the question now is, what damages will the Respondents recover from the United States? And -- and in that setting, most certainly the claim against the individuals is barred by section 233(a).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_john_paul_stevens<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, Your Honor, California law is what's been discussed in the briefs.

      "Not exactly, Your Honor. There is no limit whatsoever on the economic damages in a case arising out of professional negligence. There is, under California law, a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages. As we have said in our briefs, we think that in this case, where Respondents have argued intentional wrongdoing by the United States, for which they can recover under the FTCA, if they can prove that something more than negligence was at issue, then it's possible under California law, although California law is not entirely clear, that they could actually exceed that $250,000 cap for noneconomic damages.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_john_paul_stevens<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "But if you're right, they should have.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, not necessarily, because there may be factual issues that -- that we're not now aware of. In other words, it may be that the government concluded that, despite what was alleged in the complaint, that when that particular individual took the acts complained of, he wasn't somehow wearing his PHS hat, he was operating in some other capacity. So -- but that's obviously just speculation. And it's -- it is not clear why that defense wasn't raised. What is clear is that it was not raised and, not only that, but in the court of appeals and in this Court, there is no reference made to the fact that he's in the Public Health Service.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_john_paul_stevens<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, that's kind of interesting that apparently the government was not aware of the breadth of the position they're -- you're now taking.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I'm not sure that's necessarily the conclusion I would draw. As I say, there may be factual reasons why it wasn't raised. There may be strategic reasons why it wasn't raised. It's hard to speculate on that so long after the -- after the fact. But what is clear from Carlson is that the way that section 233(a) did arise in that case is that the Court used it as a specific example to contrast with the FTCA itself, and said that section 233 was a place where Congress had made known explicitly its intent that the FTCA be the exclusive remedy and that other remedies be precluded. That's the way that 233(a) was argued in the briefs in that case, and that's how the Court used it. And that's obviously extremely supportive of the Petitioners' plea for immunity here. This Court has already essentially recognized in Carlson, in reasoning in support of its holding, that that is the role that 233(a) plays, and the Court must have been talking about barring Bivens claims because that's what Carlson was about. So that's the significance of 233(a) in that case. The Respondents also -- on a subject we haven't touched on yet, I think, look at the title of section 233(a) and some of its other subsections, and there I think it's clear that the title can't vary the clear statutory text in any way. Even if the title were relevant here, it talks about negligence and malpractice. And we've cited in our reply brief, at pages 18 to 19, the authorities showing that when the statute was enacted in 1970, malpractice was thought to sweep very broadly to cover any bad acts, any malpractice, and so it doesn't operate -- the title here can't operate as a limitation on the scope of this provision. With respect to the history, the one other thing that I wanted to point out that I didn't get to in my answer before is another odd result that you would have, if you looked at when Bivens was decided and made that your deciding factor, is that the FTCA's judgment bar, at 28 U.S.C. section 2676, which was enacted in 1948, which says that when you take a claim against the United States under the FTCA all the way to judgment, you are barred from raising any other civil action or proceeding by reason of the same subject matter. So very similar language to what we have here. That wouldn't bar Bivens claims, even though every court of appeals to have looked at the issue has said that it does cover Bivens claims in a different sense.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_anthony_m_kennedy<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",

      "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: By its plain terms, section 233(a) precludes any civil action against officers and employees of the Public Health Service arising out of performance of their medical duties. Instead, it makes an action against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act the exclusive remedy for injury arising out of PHS-provided care. Unlike the Westfall Act, section 233 contains no carve-out for constitutional claims, nor is there any textual basis for which to imply one. Accordingly, this Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision allowing Respondents' Bivens claims against the individual Petitioners on top of their FTCA claims against the United States. Now, even assuming Congress did not specifically have Bivens claims in mind at the time that they enacted this statute, that's no reason to limit the plain terms of section 233(a). First, Justice Kennedy, going to your question about whether there's authority for that proposition that when Congress doesn't specifically anticipate a certain set of facts yet the plain terms control, that that is the correct result, this Court has stated both in the RICO context as well as in other contexts that the fact that Congress doesn't specifically contemplate application of the statute to particular circumstances simply demonstrates the breadth of the statute and not any ambiguity. Those statements are set forth on page 15 of our brief, Sedima, Yeskey, and others. The second point I would make is the best indication of Congress's broad intent is simply the plain terms of the statute. Congress could have enacted a statute that only provided immunity for, say, negligent performance of medical duties. It included no such limitation in 233(a). It could have made the FTCA remedy exclusive of, say, only common law causes of action or State law causes of action, or even existing causes of action. It did not do that. It said it is the exclusive remedy for any other civil action by reason of the same subject matter. Congress could--<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_ruth_bader_ginsburg<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Shah, is that -- is that the same -- in all the statutes that Carlson cites on page 20, when they say that Congress follows the practice of explicitly stating what it means to make the FTCA an exclusive remedy, there's this -- the Gonzalez Act and there's 233(a), and then there is the swine flu. Are they all -- are all those provisions, provisions like 233(a), that say \"any civil action\"?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "--Yes, Your Honor, in terms of that latter phrasing \"exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding. \" For example, the Gonzalez Act, which is reproduced in the gray brief on page 1a of our -- of the government's appendix, it uses very similar language. It says: The FTCA remedy shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding by reason of the same subject matter. That's identical language to that used in 233(a). Now, there is a way in which 233(a) is even broader than any of those other statutes in its description of what type of performance of medical duties is covered. There, there is no modifier of negligence or wrongful act or omission. It simply says: Any performance of medical duties is covered. In the Gonzalez Act, which we would submit has as quite broad language and should have the same effect, they at least have a qualifier of negligent or wrongful act or omission. Not that that should create a change in result, but it just goes to show the incredibly broad language that Congress used to show -- that Congress used in 233(a). And I think on the Gonzalez Act point -- and Justice Sotomayor, I think this goes to your question about whether there are other statutes -- even though that Congress may not have contemplated Bivens at the time, the Gonzalez Act was passed in 1976, 5 years after Bivens had decided, and yet Congress used the identical language or nearly identical language as present in 233(a) in enacting the Gonzalez Act. Presumably, Congress was aware of the potential for Bivens liability at the time, yet they chose to use the same categorical text. And in the legislative history of the Gonzalez Act, they say they used that text for the specific purpose of ensuring total financial immunity -- immunity from total financial liability for DOD and armed forces medical personnel.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_sonia_sotomayor<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "--as opposed to PHS personnel, then you're right, they would fall under the Westfall Act, and there would be the carve-out for constitutional claim. Now, what we do know is that Congress enacted this special protection for Public Health Service personnel and singled them out at the Surgeon General's request in 1970. And I think it's important to remember, in 1970 -- this is pre-Westfall Act -- it was not at all clear that Federal medical personnel were immune even from common law negligence, for example. And so even from that point, putting Bivens liability aside, Congress chose to accord special protection to PHS personnel above and beyond that entitled to those who they were working with side by side, say in the Bureau of Prisons or in detention--<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_samuel_a_alito_jr<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "\n",
      "--Well -- well, Your Honor, in terms of the -- in terms of the ordinary claims, the common law claims, of course, that would be covered by the Westfall Act. In terms of Bivens, in terms of insurance against Bivens claims in particular, my understanding -- and this is anecdotal -- is that most -- most of the medical personnel in the Bureau of Prisons do not have any other protection beyond that that's provided by the Westfall Act. That is, they don't have separate policies. There is -- at least according to the citation in Respondents' brief about a Web site that shows that you can get Bivens insurance. It's not clear to me whether that's available to Federal -- Federal medical personnel, at least in the amounts of insurance that might be necessary to adequately protect them--<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_antonin_scalia<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, we're -- you know, we're talking here as though Congress is a perpetual unchanging institution. Why would it have done this for Public Health Service employees and not have done this for Bureau? It wasn't the same Congress that passed those two Acts. The one may have been a stingier Congress than the other, or there -- there may have been more lobbying by one of the other groups in one case. I don't see any reason why we have to philosophically reconcile the -- the granting of -- of greater immunity to Public Health Service employees.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "--Justice Scalia, I completely agree. I think it's correct that the important fact is the fact that Congress accorded them special protection. Again, this was -- this was at the request, the specific request of the Surgeon General, and they did this to help revitalize the Public Health Service. Now, I don't think that it's -- that the Public Health Service -- it's anomalous that they get this protection. I think they're in many ways similarly situated to medical personnel who have served for DOD in the armed forces. Like DOD medical personnel, PHS officers can be assigned to very difficult situations and settings, sometimes in armed conflict, other custodial settings, and they can be ordered to perform certain medical conditions. In the Gonzalez Act legislative history, Congress says that that was a reason -- an additional reason as to why they wanted to accord immunity. And I think PHS personnel are similarly situated. If this Court were looking for a reason, the fact is they were accorded the same immunity, and that's the dispositive factor.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_antonin_scalia<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as a matter of curiosity, do all of these immunity provisions come out of the same committee? Or can one assume that the Public Health Service may have come out of one committee of Congress, the Bureau of Prisons may have come out of another committee of Congress, the DOD may have come out of a third committee of Congress?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Right. I don't know if they all came out of the same committee, but these certainly span a wide spectrum of years, all the way from the 1960s to -- to the late 1970s, in terms of when these various immunity provisions were enacted. Some of them happened at the same time, like, I believe, the provision for NASA personnel was added at the same time the Gonzalez Act was passed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_samuel_a_alito_jr<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "If section 2679(b)(2), instead of saying paragraph (1) does not extend nor apply, had said the remedy against the United States provided by sections 1346(b), et cetera, and repeated that language from (b)(1), and then said: \"Is not the exclusive remedy in any civil action against an employee of the government. \" and continued with subsection (2), then the result here would be different, wouldn't it?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Your Honor, it may be a closer case but I don't think that the result would be different, and here's why: If you look at the text of 233(a) -- and this is on the very last page of the -- of the government's brief -- it does refer to the FTCA in terms of the remedy that a -- that a plaintiff should seek, but it's not -- it does not look to the FTCA to make that remedy exclusive. Instead, it provides independent language, independent of the FTCA, to make the remedy exclusive. It says, \"The remedy against the United States. \" under the FTCA -- that's what it references -- \"for damage for personal injury including death resulting from. \" medical performance -- and then it has its own language -- \"shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding by reason of the same subject matter. \" It does not reference the FTCA in that latter clause, and it's that latter clause that makes the remedy exclusive. So, regardless of the language of the Westfall Act, I think -- I don't think it would make a difference to the result if Congress had used the wording that you suggest, Justice Alito. The one -- the one final point I'd like to make is I think it bears emphasizing that this is not a case where there is no other relief than a Bivens remedy available. The FTCA remedy is not only available generally, but the United States has already admitted liability on Respondents' medical negligence claim in this case. The only difference from Respondents' amount -- from Respondents' perspective now is the amount of damages that are recoverable, and we would submit--<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_ruth_bader_ginsburg<|end_header_id|>\n",
