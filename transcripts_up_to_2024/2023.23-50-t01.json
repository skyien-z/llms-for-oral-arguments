And so doing this sort of counterfactual predicting what the magistrate would have done kind of undermines that goal. And so I think the Williams rule, which basically says, look, if you could have done this as a warrantless arrest, right, if you didn't need the warrant, you didn't need to have a Gerstein hearing, you know, and you only detained him for a few hours, then it's fine if the warrant process was totally corrupt."

I think the main disagreement is about how far the Court ought to go in its opinion and what issues it should decide. I understood Petitioner to be saying that the Court should say simply that it is possible to bring a Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution claim even when a valid charge is accompanied by a baseless charge and to stop there. We think it's important for the Court to take one step further and to say that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the baseless charge caused an unreasonable seizure. That's an important step to take because if there's no unreasonable seizure, there's no violation of the Fourth Amendment. But it's also not a significant step to take because you'd just be reaffirming what you've already said in Thompson. Now, I understand Respondents asked the Court to take one step further still and to determine that the seizure in this particular case was reasonable."

The Sixth Circuit correctly concluded that Petitioner  cannot make that showing because probable cause supported his detention. Petitioner was arrested and detained for three days pursuant to a warrant supported by probable cause for two first degree misdemeanor crimes, each carrying a sentence up to six months imprisonment. In light of that, the presence of a third charge, allegedly lacking probable  cause, could not have resulted in Petitioner's detention."

Moreover, in Baker versus McCollan, the Court concluded that a three-day seizure like Petitioner's did not violate the Fourth Amendment because the arrest and detention was pursuant to a warrant supported by probable cause, even though police in that case had actually detained an innocent individual based on a mistaken identification. Applying the correct Fourth Amendment rule here means setting aside the charge that Petitioner alleges to have lacked probable cause and assessing whether the remaining charges objectively justify his detention."

So, to answer Justice Kagan's question first, we are totally fine with the United States' position, answer the question presented, reiterate what you said in Thompson, that the malicious prosecution must have resulted in a seizure, which, as the United States points out, is perfectly consistent with our preferred Eleventh Circuit formulation, and don't touch the question of the warrant clause. We raised the warrant clause to talk about the values and purposes of the Fourth Amendment only, not to suggest there is necessarily a 1983 claim predicated on it or what constitutional tort applies. As for Respondents' position, I'll just note that what they're now describing as a strawman is precisely what they argued for below."
