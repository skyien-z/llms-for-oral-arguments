I do want to say that I understand the Corner Post petitioner to have suggested maybe there would be equitable defenses that the  government could raise in those kinds of cases. We would certainly want to raise that type of defense with respect to the approval of mifepristone, which I think has generated tremendous reliance interests and proven to be safe and effective over decades of use."
