0,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, You --can a consent decree or a default judgment support a prevailing party?
1,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?
2,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language."
3,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?"
4,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard."
5,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits."
6,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI."
7,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?"
8,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?"
9,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors."
10,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?"
11,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?"
12,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?"
13,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?"
14,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument."
15,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?"
16,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes."
17,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that."
18,2024.23-621-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," Do you think that the statutes in which Congress requires that there be a final order before you can -- before you can have a prevailing party, do you think that's just simply superfluous?"
19,2024.23-621-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Well, you say, if I understand it, you don't have to get final judgment on all the claims, right?  You just need to prevail on one. Now, if you prevail on  one, can you get the attorney fees that are associated with 2, 3, and 4?"
20,2024.23-621-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," What do you do with the case that Justice Jackson posed, which is common?  I want to -- I want to participate in this protest, this parade  --"
21,2024.23-621-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," So, for example, the Chief -- Chief Justice's hypothetical, after the parade, I could ask for a trial on the merits in -- in accompanying the PI and a final judgment could be issued at that time?"
22,2024.23-621-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," -- on at least that claim on which you would be prevailing, right?"
23,2024.23-621-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson, And  --and isn't that the statute we're talking about here? Right?
24,2024.23-621-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Can I just ask about Justice Gorsuch's example?  What if I don't want to spend the time and additional money to litigate this through to a declaratory judgment or a future?  What if I just want to march in  the parade tomorrow?  I'm a religious organization, for example. I don't  --you know, I agree with traditional marriage, and tomorrow is the LGBTQ parade and I want to march in it. I want to be able to be there. I  -- I'm not making a whole thing out of it."
25,2024.23-621-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," Ms. Maley said that she didn't know of a circuit that it accept ed -- that had accepted this categorical position, if it's a preliminary injunction, there are no fees. Do you know of any circuit that's accepted this categorical position?"
26,2024.23-621-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," -- so now there's -- there's a uniform rule. You don't know of anything  --any court that's gone the other way. You know what?  It's an interesting thing. It seems that this comes up all the time, and it seems as though it's come up frequently just in recent years. When I was talking to my clerks about this, you know, several had confronted this issue with respect to COVID litigation, where  people went to courts and they asked for injunctions from various kinds of COVID policies, and then, you know, in the end, those  policies were changed or were scrapped or were abandoned in some way. So it seems as though there's quite a lot of recent law that cuts against you here from circuits, like, pretty much all across the U.S."
27,2024.23-621-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," Okay. I don't think that that's what I was asking about. I was asking really, you know, do you have any law out there on your side?"
28,2024.23-621-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Well, that  -- that raises the question for me, why -- why do you think they've been not seeing the light?"
29,2024.23-621-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?"
30,2024.23-621-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," The Respondents argue that there is a historical background of a venerable equitable tradition of awarding interim costs, including for a preliminary injunction, and that, if accepted, would perhaps undercut your historical argument. Do you want to say something about that?"
31,2024.23-621-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," Just to be clear, Buckhannon, there was no court -ordered relief whatsoever, correct?"
32,2024.23-621-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," And, as I read the decision, that was mostly the focus of the decision?"
33,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Well, it does seem to me that the courts then have to figure out, if prevailing is not going to mean final judgment on  -- on the merits for at least one claim, then it must be a pretty ambiguous thing where you -- what constitutes prevailing? Now you say, well, in a preliminary injunction case, where there's nothing going on beyond the time when the preliminary injunction does its work, maybe that's easy. But there are all sorts of other ways. If ""prevailing"" doesn't mean you actually have to win, I mean, what falls short of that?"
34,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Yes and no. I mean, you know, if you -- let me give you a hypothetical and -- and let's take it out of this state context. Let's just say there are two neighbors, and one of them is pouring pollutants into a stream that goes onto the other neighbor's property, right?  And so the injured neighbor sues and he sues for a permanent injunction, but, first, he sues for a preliminary injunction. And a preliminary injunction is gotten, all right?  He gets  --he gets  -- and -- and -- and for the next three years, while the court decides the case, he has a very valuable thing, which is the neighbor has not been able to pour pollutants into his stream anymore, right?  But then the court changes its mind and the court says we're not going to grant the permanent injunction, right?  And -- and the -- the plaintiff says, well, I got something really significant. I got three years' worth of a -- of a preliminary injunction and that was fantastic. So I should get fees for that, the same way I get fees for winning one claim out of three, right?  Does he get fees?"
35,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," And -- and even though, like, Sole does say  --I mean, I take the point that Sole reserved this question. But Sole does sort of say:  You can split things up by claims, but we're not so keen on where -- on splitting things up temporally. Like, if you lost the permanent injunction, the fact that you've gotten three  years of excellent relief is just not going to get you any fees at all, right?"
36,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Okay. Now let's say there is no permanent injunction because the  neighbor dies or, you know, the stream goes dry, all right, and so all that's left is the preliminary injunction. The court could have done the same thing, you know, if it had gotten to the permanent injunction, which is to say no, but something just sort of fortuitous has happened to stop the case. Why does the -- why does the analysis change?"
37,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Well, he hasn't, because he did go to court to get the permanent thing. I mean, the preliminary injunction was a  kind of way station on the way to getting the permanent thing. But what he really wanted -- this is not the single parade, right?  What he really wanted was for you never  --for that stream that  -- those pollutants never to bother him. And, essentially, what Sole says is: Because you didn't get that, you don't get that way station re lief, right? And so  -- so I'm just sort of suggesting that take out the final determination and just say:  We never get to the final determination because of some fortuity. Why does all of a sudden he get the award for the way station?"
38,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," Well, how  --how -- how is that?  I mean, the river runs dry. I came to court, on Justice Kagan's hypothetical, to seek an order against my neighbor to stop him from doing things, and I got a prelimin ary injunction, but then the river ran dry, and so the court dismissed it as moot. Now the -- the court has not adjudicated in a final way anybody's rights with respect to anything. And I didn't get the relief I came to court seeking. It was denied to me in the end in the final judgment. And we normally think of all preliminary orders in a case as merging into and superseded by the final judgment. And I think that's what Sole is driving at too. So help --help me out. I'm  -- I'm stuck where Justice Kagan is."
39,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," Well, we also have after Buckhannon a pretty -- pretty pointed  example of them saying just the opposite, right? That if we're going to depart from the American rule and allow attorney's fees -- and, you know, one can be a  --a fan of the American rule or not, it doesn't really matter, but there it is. Congress spoke very clearly after Buckhannon to vindicate what Justice Ginsburg thought was appropriate in the FOIA context against the federal government. And, as the federal government points out, mightn't we expect Congress to be at least as clear when it's authorizing fees against other parties, including states?"
40,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Counsel, I'd like to talk about the prevailing party for a minute. I mean, when you get a PI, you're not the prevailing party. The court has made a predictive judgment that you'll probably be the prevailing party, you know, and some circuits are still using this sliding scale. You know, you can't disregard the merits un der Winter, but, you know, you might have gotten the preliminary injunction because the equities were really strong, because maybe the pollution is running onto your property. And, I mean, I have not been a district judge, but, as someone who's dealt with our emergency docket, you know, you are making  those kinds of preliminary judgments in a -- in a very compressed time frame and it's like a 51 percent, like, as you showed, a reasonable likelihood of success. Why is that prevailing because a district court has made that judgment on a PI?"
41,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett, Couldn't you have asked under Rule 65 to speed that up?
42,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Had you  --did you have a motion -- oh, sorry, just one last question. Did you have a motion for summary judgment pending?  I just don't know the answer to that from  --"
43,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," That was the point. You did ask for it to be speeded up, and the Respond  -- and the Petitioners asked them to wait for the legislature to act, correct?"
44,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," I don't know why asking them to speed it up and have more process is the solution in an attorney's fees case. I mean, aren't you incurring more fees if we're going to have additional process?  And it -- it just seems odd to me that we'd be in a world in which, to avoid having attorney's fees on the lesser victory, we are encouraging additional litigation."
45,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", Suppose you had requested nominal damages. Then what would have happened?
46,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," All right. When there's not a state defendant then and you had a claim -- and the party has a claim for nominal  damages, but what it really wants is a preliminary injunction?  It gets the preliminary injunction, and then the case is litigated on the issue of whether the party's entitled to nominal damages. And at that point, the court changes its mind and says:  My interpretation of the law was incorrect when I issued the preliminary injunction. Then what happens?"
47,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Do you think your client under those circumstances would be very depressed?  Well, I got the preliminary  injunction, but what I really wanted was a dollar in nominal damages?"
48,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh, Can you address the idea that the American rule should be a firm background principle and should  --we should require Congress to speak especially clearly when it wants to deviate from that and including the scope of how much Congress wants to deviate?
49,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Well, why is that? Lots of times, we  -- we will say, with background principles of statutory  interpretation, to the extent, not just any deviation. So why couldn't you here too say to the extent Congress is deviating from the American rule, the background American rule, it needs to be clear?"
50,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," And then, relatedly, I guess, what about the separation of powers principle that Justice Gorsuch referred  to and Mr. Yang referred to, which is we should really leave  --when there's doubt, we should leave this to Congress to fix this?  In part,  the court of appeals story, while helpful to you in some respects, I think is unhelpful in the respect there are all sorts of different tests out there because they're just completely at sea in trying to figure out how to handle this. Do you just want to respond to that argument?"
51,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Well, what -- what if you get a preliminary injunction and, under your rule, you get attorney's fees, okay,  but then the case continues on and you lose at the permanent -- you don't get a permanent injunction?  Do you have to give back the attorney's fees?"
52,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Well, if that's the case, doesn't it make -- doesn't that undermine your argument?  In other words, it's a recognition that, of course, the preliminary injunction is not final and, therefore, the award of attorney's fees shouldn't be final."
53,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," So, when the statute says ""prevailing party,"" it's really saying including temporarily prevailing party?"
54,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Is  -- is another way to address the Chief Justice's question that what we're looking for is whet her you are entitled to prevailing party status and that you can be deemed a prevailing party, you  --in your view, based on a preliminary injunction when you can  -- maybe sometimes you can't, you're -- you're -- you're not saying you always are -- you're just saying reject the statement that you can never be. So sometimes a preliminary win can confer prevailing party status, but the actual award of the fees that you would get happens when the case is over. At the end of the day, then the court goes back and we look how much attorney's time was put into it. As Justice Sotomayor points out, it's a  --you know, was it a reasonable fee request for that work that went into the PI?"
55,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," And  --and you can be divested. The reason why you wait until the end in part is because, even though you might have had prevailing party status in our view, your view, early on as a result of the PI, if the case continues and it's reversed, the -- the judgment that -- on the merit that made you a prevailing party to begin with, then, at the end of the day, when we're doing the calculation, we say, nope, you don't get prevailing party status at that point?"
56,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," -- is that if it's mooted, if nothing else happens, you retain your prevailing party status on the basis of that win?"
57,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," We've -- we've talked about preliminary injunction as a way in which you may be a prevailing party, even though you  -- not -- not final, but what about a discovery dispute?  What about the case turns on whether you can get access to particular documents, and you win on that?  You don't get a preliminary injunction. You obviously don't get a final injunction. But you won, you got  the documents, and then the case goes away, whatever, for whatever reason. Could you be awarded fees on that? You won a very significant motion."
58,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," And, of course, that's why you're saying sometimes a -- a PI may not confer prevailing party status?  That's an example?"
59,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," So your position is simply PI, it's either going to be a permanent injunction or it's going to be a preliminary injunction, and those are the only two things that could entitle you to attorney's fees?"
60,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.", Any other type of relief doesn't count as prevailing?
61,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Well, in the one case  --I guess I still don't have -- understand the answer. The alter -- material alteration in my hypothetical is you have access to the documents. That's a material alteration. But that doesn't entitle you to attorney's fees?"
62,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," Counsel, you keep coming to the material alteration of the parties' relationship in responding to the Chief Justice and others. I would have thought that that was exactly the argument made in Sole and in our hypothetical that Justice Kagan and I discussed. For a period of time, there was a material alteration in the relationship between the parties, but that's not enough. It's got to be a final, at the -- when the matter comes to rest, that -- that's the implication of a prevailing party as traditionally understood, is the one who wins in the end, not temporarily. And -- and so are you really just asking -- are you fighting with Sole, which says even a material alteration temporarily that is subsequently withdrawn doesn't count, right?"
63,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch, So it can't be just a material alteration. There has to be something more. And why isn't that something more the final judgment?
64,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," At the end -- so we do have to look at the end of the case and see what the court said at the end of the case, right?"
65,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," No, no, no, no, no, no. No implication. I'm looking at the  judgment because I'm supposed to look at the judgment, the final judgment, prevailing party. Who wins at the end?  The court says case dismissed."
66,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor, What do you do with a dismissal that's Munsingwear that vacates the preliminary injunction?
67,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," I  --I'm not saying that. I'm just asking the question,  which is, if a court doesn't believe that you -- that it should continue an injunction, it'll vacate it, correct?"
68,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," Well, when you dismiss a case, the PI disappears. What's the difference?  It's merged into the final judgment. Do I need to say I withdraw my PI? No. A district judge says case dismissed."
69,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Counsel, I see your red light is on. Justice Kavanaugh, anything? (Laughter.)"
70,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," Just as a recap, what's your definition of ""prevailing party""?"
71,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," So I still don't understand then your answer when the neighbor dies. It's still unreversed, right?"
72,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, Is there any other interlocutory relief that could support a  prevailing party other than preliminary injunction?
73,2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Justice Alito? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Jackson? Thank you, counsel."
74,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," What does it mean to be injured, someone to be injured, in his business?"
75,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, Can loss of employment ever constitute a injury in business?
76,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," -- isn't that an issue or shouldn't it be an issue of proximate cause, which wasn't reached in this case, correct?"
77,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," If you're harmed when you lose a job, then you've been injured in your business, haven't you?  I mean, just as -- I -- I guess what I'm saying is the simplest, clearest reading of this statutory language is it doesn't -- it doesn't distinguish by what causes the harm. It  just says, if you're harmed in a way that's in your business or property, which has been understood to include being harmed by loss of a  job, and that's by reason of a violation of Section 1962, then you're entitled to threefold the damages you would otherwise be  --"
78,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Ms. Blatt, can I ask you where you get your definition of ""legal injury""?  I mean, are you looking at just kind of general tort principles?  I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out exactly how you look at it and define it."
79,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Where does the ""legal"" in the ""legal right"" come from?  Are you looking kind of at general principles?  You're just looking at the nature of the harm?  Does it help you in terms of property or --"
80,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Yeah, but those are in other counts. Those are in the personal injury counts. And I think that matters, right?"
81,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But does your test need to rely on the consumption?  I mean, suppose there was  --suppose the employer's rule."
82,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," All right?  So suppose we have the same basic situation, but the employer's rule is that you can't possess --"
83,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson, Does he have a RICO claim or not under those circumstances?
84,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," And -- and isn't that essentially what's wrong with this case too, is what Justice Sotomayor was suggesting?"
85,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," -- on Justice Barrett's question?  Because I think the other side says that injury, just ordinary meaning, means harm."
86,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh, -- in tort law. Can you elaborate on why injury does not equal harm?  Because that's --
87,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson, But why is this a damage from personal injury?  That's the part I don't understand. He's not claiming that he got  ill because of the product. He's not saying he was personally injured. He didn't even know --
88,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But why are you saying that?  You can -- I mean, you're just saying that. I'm asking you, you know --"
89,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," -- there are -- there are personal injury claims that derive  from a person being harmed by -- by the ingestion of the product, right?  They're bodily, physically harmed because they have taken this thing. I don't read this claim to be that kind of injury. He's not saying that the  product itself injured him in any way."
90,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," So even Homer nods, the great Areeda and Hovenkamp treatise wrong?"
91,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Ms. Blatt, aren't you estopped from claiming that he has a personal injury here when below you argued or  your client argued that he had no personal injury, which is why all the personal injury claims were dismissed?"
92,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh, Do you want to respond to their invocation of the liberal construction canon?
93,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito?"
94,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Well, you say that under RICO, injury is ""the invasion of a legal right.""  So how would we go about determining  whether something is a legal right for this purpose?"
95,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor, But that goes back to what Justice Jackson and  -- and what I tried earlier and Justice Kagan point out:  You're trying to say there's a difference between the two. But we've made very clear in WesternGeco there isn't. Injury is where you feel the harm. Now the question is:  What's the harm?
96,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.", Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Jackson?
97,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson, Can I just ask you about a hypo?  Because I'm still trying to understand your rule. You seem to be suggesting that the mere existence of physical harm renders any business injury not compensable. Is that  -- is that the  --do I have the sum total of your --
98,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," -- and so, here, you say he took the drugs and that was an injury. And he says:  I was also fired. Why isn't that  two injuries too?"
99,2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But this is -- imagine that this is not damages in the following sense, all right?  If we have a case  in which he takes the drugs --"
100,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas, Is the loss of income from being fired an injury in business?
101,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas, And is -- what's the difference between injury and damages?
102,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," So, if the harm is a loss of income, aren't you collapsing or conflating the two?"
103,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Counsel, I understood the business-or-property limitation as having been intended to be a significant limitation on the reach of RICO. Your friend said that your position would make every slip and fall a RICO violation. Why isn't that the case?"
104,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," You mean  --by ""this guardrail,"" you mean the business-or-property restriction?"
105,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh, Do you agree that the statute excludes damages for personal injuries?
106,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," And the question is whether -- I think the question and the problem here that we have to figure out is, when you characterize them, if they are damages from personal injury, can you just recharacterize them as injury to business or property and get around, as the Chief Justice's point, the limitation that Congress at least thought was important?"
107,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Just to close it out, you're okay if we say injury is the invasion of legal right?"
108,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Ms. Anand, just a couple quick questions. First, in your dialogue with Justice Kavanaugh, there was some discussion of lost wages and medical expenses. Do you think medical expenses are recoverable as well as lost wages under business  and property?"
109,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch, And would you  -- would you encourage us to do so here?
110,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Okay. All right. And the second question:  There was an extensive dialogue about the car wash hypothetical and the kidnapping hypothetical, and if I understood Ms. Blatt, her argument, it goes something like this:  that there are two injuries, however characterized, whether as a harm or an invasion  of a legal right. One is the assault or the kidnapping. The other is the act of extortion. And only the latter is recoverable, and it isn't a causation question so much as the nature of the injury in those two cases. Your best response?"
111,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch, That the assault in -- in the car wash hypothetical and the kid -- act of kidnapping in the kidnapping hypothetical may or may not be recoverable depending upon whether they're proximately related to the extortion acts in both cases?
112,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," If we agree with your reasoning but reserve the question of the coverage of medical expenses, would there, in  a later case, be a principled basis for drawing that distinction, or would we be effectively deciding that by agreeing with your reasoning?"
113,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," One other question. There's been talk about proximate cause. I assume you believe on remand you can show that the injury here, the lost wages, were proximately caused. Could you explain why?"
114,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," Ms. Anand, it seems to me -- and  --and, you know, I just would like to get your take on this -- that Medical Marijuana has litigated this case differently than it was framed below and differently than the circuits that are on its side of the split in this definition of ""injury.""  You know, the  Second Circuit said:  Well, if personal injury is the derivative of the property damage, it doesn't count. As you said and as Justice Kagan said when she was going back and forth with Ms. Blatt, proximate cause seems a natural home for this. I mean, what do you think?  I mean, can you point to developed ideas in the courts of appeals about how to define this injury? This idea of looking to a federal definition  of it, looking to Restatements, I mean, in your view, are there circuits that are actually doing that?"
115,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," So, in your view, Medical Marijuana's theory of the case is kind of novel?"
116,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Ms. Anand, did your client suffer a personal injury that caused his firing and lost wages?"
117,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," -- in seeking to dismiss all of the personal injury claims, correct?"
118,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Well, why wouldn't there be a personal injury, though?  Just -- you  -- there's a failure to warn that this product contains ingredients that your -- your  --your client didn't know about and should have known about and had a right to know about. I would have thought that that would have been kind of a classic personal injury."
119,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," No, I understand. But this is  -- this --that was your theory below?"
120,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you, counsel. A big part of your answer in your dialogue with Justice Scalia to why this  -- why we shouldn't worry about the expansion of RICO that your -- your friend suggests might follow is that you have to show proximate cause. And I -- I don't quite remember your formulation. I'm sure it was carefully guarded. But you  -- you --you suggested that that w as going to be hard to do, right?  Tell me again why that is."
121,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Well, what's so hard about that?  In other words, if you're concerned about the reach of your argument and your  answer is, don't worry, we have to show proximate cause, that seems like a pretty normal proximate cause argument."
122,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Well, just out  of curiosity, why do you think you're going to face a heavy burden on remand to show foreseeability? Wouldn't you argue that a company that advertises its product as being completely free of THC, not just that it has only such an infinitesimal amount that it's not going to get people high, but it is completely free of T HC, is appealing to a category of potential customers who, for some reason, want to make sure that they don't ingest even a tiny, tiny amount of -- of THC? And when someone who purchases the product then suffers the consequences of having a very small amount of THC in that person's system, that is an entirely foreseeable result?"
123,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Well, I think you're -- are you overstating your argument?  If we look back at everything that the Court has done in civil RICO cases, I -- I certainly don't think the Court has consistently applied the  -- the liberal construction policy or just relied on the plain language of the statute. RICO is a  -- RICO is a tough thing to deal with."
124,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr.", Justice Sotomayor?  Justice Kagan? Justice Kavanaugh?
125,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," A couple questions. The -- the larger issue afoot from the amicus briefs, of course, is the class action MDL, that state tort suits are going to be converted into civil RICO because you can get treble damages, and this is going to be a bit of a change. On that, one thing you've stressed is proximate cause. When  -- of course, in those types of suits -- and you can respond whether you think that's correct or not, that factual -- prediction. But, in those kinds of suits, of  course, getting past the motion to dismiss, getting past summary judgment is the key. When would proximate cause be resolved?"
126,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," What about the factual prediction?  Do you want to say anything about that?  Because the amicus briefs really are quite aggressive on that. And you could say  yes, but that's good, or you can say no, that's not going to happen. And, if it's the latter,  I'd like to hear why."
127,2024.23-365 -t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," And it seems as though some of the concern is, you know, are we expanding beyond what the text says here and would it be a sea change that actually brings in  a lot of things that weren't intended to be covered, or is Ms. Blatt asking us to narrow down what the text says and make business and  -- or property, you know, narrower?  I kind of see it as the latter, but can you just speak to that as the final word here?"
128,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, Would it  -- would this  --would it also apply under 924?
129,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," You make a lot of the fact that -- that you've been -- this has been regulated for half a century. But it wasn't regulated in this way for half a century. What was the  -- the original reg, the previous reg?"
130,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," Yeah, General, I'm looking at agency letters stretching back as -- as far back as 1978, and each of them basically used the same language that the current regulation is using. The agency letter in '78  said it evaluated an -- an item on whether it had reached a stage of manufacture such that it might be readily converted to functional condition, correct?  That's what you're tal king about?"
131,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," General, I want to know what our standard of review here is, because I can imagine a frame or receiver that is just a block of metal that -- not readily convertible. I can also imagine some part kits  that require such tremendous amount of work that it doesn't qualify as readily convertible. So, if I can point to one item that wouldn't qualify, would  --could be swept  up potentially by your  --by the new regulation, is that enough to defeat a facial challenge?  Is it enough, or is that always an as-applied challenge?"
132,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," What is the meaning of the term ""weapon"" in 921(a)(3)(A)?"
133,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," -- it may have to undergo a conversion, but before it's converted, it must be a weapon?"
134,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", But is it  -- is it the case that components that can easily be  converted into something constitute that thing before they are converted as a matter of ordinary usage?
135,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," I'm going to show you. Here's a  --here's a blank pad, and here's a pen, all right?  Is this a grocery list?"
136,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," -- if I show you -- I put out on a counter some eggs, some chopped-up ham, some chopped-up pepper, and onions, is that a western omelet?"
137,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", Okay. So that's helpful. So your definition is a -- a -- a group of components that are -- can readily be -- converted into something and have no other use. They must have no other use in order to constitute that thing?
138,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," In that situation, they already constitute that thing?"
139,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," General Prelogar, I just want to follow up on Justice Alito's question about the omelet. Would your answer change if you ordered it from HelloFresh and you got a kit, and it was like turkey chili, but all of the ingredients are in the kit?"
140,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Can I ask you about the difference between the ""destructive device"" and ""machine gun"" definitions that also reference parts in the way that this definition does not?  I've just been thinking about, in 1968, in the Gun Control Act, why Congress might have done that differently. And these ghost guns weren't around. These kits are a more  recent problem, which doesn't mean that the plain language doesn't cover the unintended consequence. But, in 1968 -- and I don't know enough about the gun industry to know if this is right, which is why I want your take on this -- wasn't it the case then, I think, that destructive devices like grenades or even machine guns were not things that you tended to buy whole because they were so heavily regulated and  -- and even illegal to purchase that way as opposed to firearms?  So they were generally purchased as components or things that were, you know, able to be converted or made  -- like, it would make sense to think about it in terms of parts? Am I thinking about that correctly based on the industry at the time?"
141,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," General, I understand your argument under (A) with respect to things that could be readily converted, but there's also the argument under (B), frame or receiver, which doesn't include that kind of language that might bring in artifact nouns more obviously. What -- what's your thought about that?"
142,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," Now we can't possibly think that every noun that Congress uses everywhere in the U.S. Code is used as an artifact noun that carries with it things like Justice Alito's pen and pencil as a grocery list, right?  So there's got to be a line that makes this on -- on your theory of the case why we should read that into (B) here but not everywhere in the U.S. Code. What -- what -- what -- what are your thoughts?"
143,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," -- right?  Lenity, notice, fair notice to people that every piece of paper and pen is a grocery list, you're on notice of that. But is there something particular to this statute that you think would -- a more narrow approach?"
144,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," -- does it help that (C)  and (D) deal with mufflers, silencers, and any other destructive devices that don't have conventional frames and receivers?  Does that help you?"
145,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," -- carry some broad language about not just complete items, might be a textual way to -- to -- to  --to narrow and focus on (B) without saying every artifact noun in the U.S. Code carries this feature?"
146,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," So it's no longer readily convertible, right?  And --"
147,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," Okay?  And it -- and it talks about partially complete, disassembled, or nonfunctional frame or receiver. That's  what we're talking about, not the firearm. And, again, maybe  --maybe there's a line that I -- a through line, but I couldn't find one between shredding and cutting into pieces. I would have thought that's pretty much the same thing."
148,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Under the rule, what percentage of the parts of a firearm kit must -- must be included in order for it to be a firearm kit?"
149,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," General, we have a clue from the statute's use of a starter gun as an example of something that's readily convertible. As I understand it, to make a starter gun operable, you either have to replace  the bore, so you need a new bore part to do that, or you have to drill out the existing  bore on the starter gun and get a pin to make it operable, correct?"
150,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor, So we know that some incomplete items qualify under the statute's definition?
151,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito?"
152,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", -- are there gun kits available now that do not consist of polymer  parts but instead consist of parts taken from disassembled firearms that have been altered in a way to make them nonfunctional without some modification?
153,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," On what it means to be readily convertible, I -- I don't know whether it's possible to do something. That's the statutory term, and I don't know whether it's possible to do something more precise than what ATF has done, but it would be interesting if  -- it would be helpful if you could perhaps explain a little bit more what that means. So what level of expertise is taken into account?  What collection of tools is taken into account?  Can you provide an y sort of a time limit?  How long must it take?  Some of us who are not -- who don't have a lot of mechanical ability have spent hours and hours and hours trying to assemble  things that we've purchased. (Laughter.)"
154,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," On parts kits first. In addition to the parts kit that's analogous to an IKEA table kit, Judge O'Connor below was concerned that that language would include sort of any aggregation of gun parts. So let's say, you know, a gunsmith just wanted to replenish inventory and got a big box of gun parts generally from a gun manufacturer. Would that count under the ATF  regulation?"
155,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," And turning to the frames or receivers, you made a point of saying that this follows in a long line of regulation. But there --- there were changes, right, that you  -- that the new regulation is intended to capture items sold with jigs and templates. Is there anything else that the new regulation was intended to capture that was not captured under the old?  And why did ATF make that change?"
156,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," And let me ask you a broader question if we step back a little bit. Sometimes this Court looks at regulations and it says, you know, there's an old statute, and the old statute doesn't contemplate a new problem, and a new problem comes up, and Congress can't get its act together and deal with the old problem. And so the agency takes old statutory language that doesn't really fit the problem  but, you know, is vague enough or general enough or broad enough, you know, so that it can be kind of made to deal with the new problem. And -- and this Court has sometimes said:  Well, that's  --that's not right. The new statute had nothing to do with  -- the old statute had nothing to do with this new problem, and this is kind of, you know, the agency just taking over what is really Congress's business. Is -- is that a story line that the Respondents here can tell about this regulation?"
157,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Your statutory interpretation has force, but I had some concern at the state stage, and I have some concern now about mens rea. And this is an agency regulation that broadens a criminal statute beyond what it had been before. So what about the seller, for example, who is truly not aware, truly not aware that they are violating the law and gets criminally charged?  What assurances can you give about mens rea, about the instructions to the jury  that the government would seek, and the like?"
158,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," And does ""willfully"" apply to all potential prosecutions that we're talking about in this case?"
159,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh, So how would that work on the background check?  I just want to make sure I'm not missing something there.
160,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," -- take the hypothetical  --you truly believe you're not violating the law, could you be charged under that provision?"
161,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh, -- that's helpful. Anything else you wanted to finish up with on that?
162,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," And on that point, because you had a lot of classification letters that were out there, this was to collect  everything and put everyone, as you say, on notice, adding a couple things, as you pointed out earlier, correct?"
163,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," So Justice Kagan talked about the problem of the agency potentially taking over what is Congress's business, and I guess I'm worried about the  different concern, which is about the Court taking over what Congress may have intended for the agency to do in this situation. And so all of my questions -- the reason why I didn't  really engage in the other part of this is because all of my questions really for you stem from that concern. You -- you've phrased the question presented in this case as whether certain items, weapons, parts, and kits, or partially complete and disassembled frames or receivers qualify as firearms within the meaning of the statute. And I guess I'm concerned about this framing because it doesn't seem to account, in my view, for the actual claim that the challengers have made here, which is that the ag ency has exceeded its statutory authority. And so I'm trying to figure out how we're supposed to address what I think is a distinct question about the scope of the agency's authority vis --vis the Court to fill out the category of what is a firearm. I mean, are we to conclude that an agency exceeds its statutory authority whenever it fails to choose what we think is the best meaning of a statutory term?  Is that how the -- the scope of the agency's authority to promulgate a rule is supposed to be determined? We just compare what the agency believes qualifies as a firearm with what we think qualifies as a firearm, and if the agency has something in its definition that we wouldn't have put there, we say the agency has exceeded its authority?  I think those seem not right to me as the way of figuring out the question of exceeding the authority, and I think it can't be assumed that the agency exceeds its authority whenever it interprets a statutory term differently than we would such that all we have to do as a part of this claim here today is just decide what we think a firearm is. Can you react to that?"
164,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," -- can --can I take you on a little bit of a  --let me just drill down a little bit, right?  The term we are interpreting, I thought, was a category . Congress has said firearms, right, and frames and receivers, which it defines, the firearms part of it, have to be treated in a certain way. And I think, in order to implement this statute, the agency has to look at real -world circumstances and determine what particular items fit into that category. I understood the delegation of this entire thing to an agency to be that task. That's what the agency's supposed to be doing. We look at firearm. We look at the definition of the firearm, says the agency, and we look at things in the world, and we say X, Y, Z, those are in that category. My question is, when the challenge is X shouldn't have been in that category, does it exceed the agency's authority if the Court thinks, yeah, X shouldn't have been in that category?  Just, you know -- I mean, the agency still has the authority, I think, and in Loper,  Loper seemed to recognize that Congress may have given the agency the authority to make certain calls, right?"
165,2024.23-852-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," So what you would have us do is not come up with our list of what items we think should be in the firearm category, like we have to think about exactly each thing. In this facial challenge, I think you're saying we need to do something more like did the agency take into account the relevant factors for making the determination of what goes in this category?"
166,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," -- at the stage of manufacture versus the ready  --what a receiver or an item is capable or ready -- can readily become. And we've had much discussion here about ""readily"" this morning. Is that analysis or that approach -- does  --does it make a difference as -- to your argument whether it is the 80 percent rule or the current ""readily become"" rule?"
167,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson, But does the 80 percent rule apply then to part A?  I'm just trying to understand your answer to Justice Thomas with respect to the 80 percent rule.
168,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," -- give your game away?  Once you admit that you need to figure  out when something has become a finished product, you have to have a standard to decide that. And you're saying the standard has to be something along -- that -- that goes to manufacturing. The SG is saying:  Yes, that's just a silent way of saying, has the manufacturing gone far enough to make this essentially a  --a -- a frame or receiver?  Can it be converted to be fully functional?  That's what they're saying, that the two are doing exactly the same thing. You prefer one because you want to sell frames without a serial number or -- or sell frames that you have to drill a hole in and say that's not regulated. They're saying a hole is really not a critical component of the frame. Everything else is."
169,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," -- are you -- you don't disagree that taking a tab off a frame, is that a completed frame?"
170,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," So, if you have to drill a hole to attach it to something, that's not a completed frame?"
171,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr.", Just what would -- what is the purpose of selling a receiver without the holes drilled in it?
172,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," -- I don't know the skills of the particular reporter, but my understanding is, is that it's not terribly difficult for someone to do this, and it's certainly not terribly difficult to take the plastic piece out. That's  --is that part of the gunsmithing?"
173,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," -- and taking the plastic out, he really wouldn't think that he has built that gun, would he?"
174,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," All right. I've got that argument. But I think you've suggested  that, no, we accept that there are incomplete frames or receivers that count. This is indeed an artifact noun. And  -- and, if that's true -- well, first of all, is that true?"
175,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Why wouldn't this be an artifact noun in this statute given (A), which does suggest incomplete things can count;  (C), you know, mufflers and silencers; (D), other destructive devices which don't have a  traditional receiver?  I think the examples we've been given are umbrella guns and pen guns and things like that. Why wouldn't that be an indication that here, if not throughout the U.S. Code,  Congress was using an artifact noun?"
176,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," But it doesn't appear in the statute. It seems a little made  up, right, the critical machining test?  I mean, your other test, I think, has the problem of pulling a tab off the front and  --and saying, okay, now it's a frame or receiver, but it wasn't before you pulled the tape. But the  critical machining doesn't really come from the statute; it's just sort of a way of allowing for a de minimis exception, right?"
177,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett, So would yo u say that it's like the ordinary usage?  Now everybody just understands based on long standing practice that this critical machining test is the point at which the frame or receiver
178,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," In -- in ordinary usage, an object that is created to perform a function may still be called by the name that's attached to that object even if it is not completely functional. Isn't that what this gets at?"
179,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Suppose I see that my neighbor is restoring a classic car, and -- but he's taken out the  -- some critical parts, and then someone says, well, what is that?  And I -- I might well say, well, that's a 1957 Thunderbird, even though it  -- you couldn't drive it and it would take some work to make it do the thing that it was originally created to do. So isn't that what  --isn't that the essence of your backup argument?  The thing must still be such that one would call it a frame or receiver even if it is not fully ready to be functional as a -- as a frame or receiver at this time?"
180,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," So what exactly does this  --does the critical manufacturing -- critical machining test involve?  What does that mean?  Explain it to somebody who -- you know, to a layperson."
181,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," So you prevented the -- you presented the Court with the critical machining alternative, and you say you have these two alternatives. The agency has presented yet another way of going about this. Do you concede that under a facial challenge like the one that you've brought, your task is actually to demonstrate that your alternatives are the only permissible ones under the statute?"
182,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," So you see the question as what is the best alternative, and the Court is just supposed to say we have three options here, which one do we think the best; the agency didn't pick the best, its rule is stricken?"
183,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But by ""incorrect,"" you mean that they don't have the authority under the statute to reach that, the  -- it's -- it's inconsistent with the statute?"
184,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Do you believe that a weapon that has been disassembled  -- a --a firearm, a gun that was once fully operational, everyone would agree was a firearm, it's disassembled, as sometimes happens, maybe even after a crime, is that still a firearm or no, under your view?"
185,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Okay. So all that matters really is (B), the frame or receiver?"
186,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Well, what's all that language doing in there if all that matters for the purpose of the definition is that it has a frame or receiver?"
187,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," I'm sorry, could you clarify for me what you mean?  Assume that there's all the parts of a gun and  -- a --a weapons kit with all the parts of the gun, but the receiver or the frame has a hole missing. So that's the weapon parts kit."
188,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," -- et cetera, just like a starter gun, to make it a weapon, would that be covered under (A)?"
189,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," So what you're  -- you're taking out of (B) ""readily convertible,"" and also taking it out of (A)?"
190,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," You have no quarrel with the proposition that the agency can, within whatever the statute limits it to do, to determine what makes a completed or nearly -- or  --a -- a completed frame or receiver?"
191,2024.23-852-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Anything further?  Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, General?"
192,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," But the --this is -- this case isn't about harm at this stage, is it?"
193,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," Well, but the problem is that the  -- a reasonable person could look at the statement and assume that because it only talks about future probabilities of  -- of this harm or this event occurring, that it never occurred. It's not  -- and there, you also have another 105 statement in which you do discuss past events. So why wouldn't one be able to read this and assume that it never happened?"
194,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, Why would you includ e in your 105 a past statement?
195,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," So if I could give you a hypothetical, and it's a modified version of one of the hypotheticals that is in the briefs. If I say to you a fire occurs at our production plant, our ability to meet our  production and sales targets could be impaired, all right, and, in fact, there had been a significant fire at the production plant, completely destroying it, where does that  -- how does that come out on your view?"
196,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan, -- surprised by that. So what if instead there was a fire and it destroyed 50 percent of the production capacity of the plant?
197,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But, Mr. Shanmugam, I  -- I guess what concerns me a little bit is I don't know if your position is appreciating the fact that past occurrences, past triggering events, can still lead to future harm and that what is misleading is the suggestion, when you make your statement completely futuristic, that no such future harm is going to occur. So let me give you an example that I hope will clarify this. So suppose a realtor is speaking to a potential buyer about a house -- and I think there was some house examples in your briefing -- and he says:  If crime goes up in this area, homeowners insurance could become more expensive. The triggering event would be crime, and the harm would be more expensive homeowners insurance. Both of those things in the  futuristic statement are happening in the future. Wouldn't it be misleading to make this statement if a string of burglaries had actually happened that month?  The homeowner has no way of knowing that. The realtor knows that. And, at the time the statement is made, homeowners insurance has actually already shot up two times higher than before. What I'm suggesting is it's misleading because the homeowner is making a determination of the risk of buying this property and paying a certain amount of homeowners insurance. And, when you say your statement totally futuristically, as though that has  --the burglaries never happened, they're miscalculating. They're being misled into making that calculation."
198,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But, I mean, isn't the whole point -- the whole point of these risk disclosure statements, as I think you admitted, is that the person who is hearing them is trying to determine whether there's going to be a future harm to their business investment, right?  I mean, isn't that what they're doing?"
199,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But why?  Why -- but can I just ask you why?  Why are you warning about the types of risks?  Isn't it because the  investor is trying to determine that if any of those risks happen, it's going to be a problem for the investment?"
200,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh, What  --what other disclosure requirements are out there about past events that are relevant to assessing this?
201,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," So, on the 50 percent hypothetical, if the 50 -- 50 percent of the plant capacity's been destroyed in the past, is there a -- a disclosure requirement that could encompass that that's separate  from the one before us?"
202,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," -- I'm having a little trouble with the question I think you're -- you're actually addressing in terms of  the relationship between 105 and the rest of it. I mean, is your position basically that:  Don't worry about half-truths under 105 because the basic problem is already going to be disclosed under other provisions?"
203,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," -- you keep accusing the Ninth Circuit of an absolute rule, but I'm hearing your absolute rule. Your absolute rule is -- or categorical rule, you say it in your brief at page 19:  ""Risk disclosures under 105 make no implied representation about a company's past experiences.""  Later, you say:  ""Forward-looking risk disclosures do not make any implied assertion about previous events and the present risk of harm they create.""  So you're  -- you want a different categorical rule. You say it's contextual, but the only context you're looking at is whether there's a misrepresentation, not a misleading representation. I think that's the question that Justice Kagan was asking you. If you take it out  --you're -- you're shaking your head yes. You're saying it has to be an explicit or implicit misrepresentation. But there's no such thing as having a m isleading represent -- misrepresentation with risk disclosures. Isn't that what you're arguing?"
204,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," All right. Let's go to these statements, okay?  I'm going to  start with the one that says:  If third parties or developers fail to adopt adequate data security practices, something could happen in  the future. But that misleading statement is omitting the critical information that Meta had failed to implement adequate practices to prevent third parties from misusing its data. It had already happened. A third party had disclosed it, failed to disclose how many millions of  -- of user information?"
205,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," -- and failed to destroy those records, as it represented it had. So why isn't that a misleading statement?"
206,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," I don't want to look at the statements -- I've read the statement the way it was stated. Let's go back to my point. Why isn't it misleading that ther e were no mechanisms by the third party, as you state, if they have inadequate mechanisms, X is going to happen?  We know there isn't any because Facebook didn't put any in."
207,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," Mr. Shanmugam, I just want to see if I've got it, okay, where you're coming from at least, okay?  A highly reticulated regulatory system, Item 105 is about risk factors and it's necessarily forward-looking. Companies typically do if/then statements. That's generally okay, you would say. Like opinions, got it, Omnicare. Unless there's some sort of affirmative representation about a fact in the world that's wrong. Is that the gist of your view?"
208,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," And  --and let me  -- let me just continue before you pivot back to Justice Sotomayor, which I want you to do too, but the  -- to take Justice Kagan's hypothetical, which we're all concerned about, right, the  50 percent, would that be in your view possibly required by other provisions like Item 101, which requires information material to an  understanding of the general development of the business?"
209,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," And Item 303, which requires a disclosure of known trends or uncertainties that have had or that are reasonably likely to have a material impact?"
210,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," And 106 as well, which is specific to cybersecurity problems?"
211,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, You  said that the risk factors are necessarily forward-looking. Is that a regulatory or a statutory requirement?
212,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Well, isn't it the case that an evaluation of risks is always forward-looking?  Isn't it inherently forward-looking?  When you want to know about what risk you face, you want to know what y our risk is in the future, right?"
213,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Well, I think the -- the intuition is that a statement that simply blandly says that there's a possibility of a risk can, in context, be extremely misleading if there is a high probability of the risk materializing. I think that is the intuition. The fact that something has happened in the past very often sheds light on the risk of a recurrence. If you analyze the reason why the thing happened in the past, you may realize that this reason persists and, therefore, it's  predictable that the same thing may happen in the past. But the mere fact that something happened in the past doesn't necessarily tell you what the risk is going forward. Do you disagree with any of that?"
214,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," All right. Let's take the  -- the hypothetical about the -- the risk of a fire, and let's say that there was a fire, it was a damaging fire, and an analysis of the reason why the fire started was that all the wiring in the plant is obsolete and eventually has to be replaced, but it can't be replaced for the next six months. So it shows there that there's a -- a substantial risk of the recurrence of a fire. On the other hand, if there was a fire and it was caused by the fact that the factory was hit by a piece of space junk that fell out of the sky, the fact that that happened doesn't really tell you much more about the probability that you're going to have another fire based on objects falling out of space. So what do we do with that situation?"
215,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," So this is very much meant to follow up on Justice Alito's questions. My -- my -- my first note is that in this statement, Facebook actually does have various kinds of statements about what has  happened in the past. It doesn't talk about Cambridge Analytica, but it does talk about other things. It says there have been hacking incidents in the past. Hacking is a real problem, and we've experienced it. And, you know, if you had left that out, I think that you would have every right to stand up there and say:  Like, who could really think that our statement says that there aren't hacking incidents in the past?  All right?  So you put in a bunch of stuff that nobody could accuse you of just take -- you know, omitting because who could think that?  But now say that there's an extraordinary release of confidential data, and let's make it even more extraordinary in this case because, if we make it this case, you know, you'll tell me this was known already and it really wasn't so bad. But, you know, just imagine that -- that every user of Facebook had all their confidential data released in some way to a third party, who then put it on the open market. So, really, quite an extraordinary mishap. And just as Justice Alito says, the reason why people want to know about that in assessing risks going forward is because it says something about the company's vulnerabilities. It might say something about operational problems of the company. It might say something about management issues at the company, like: How does a company allow that to happen?  I better go find out. So -- so why wouldn't that be required here?  Whatever anything else requires, what  -- you know, what -- whatever other requirements there are, this requirement, which talks about -- which is supposed to give people an understanding of future risks, an investor needs to know that, doesn't she?"
216,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," Thank you, Chief. Mr. Shanmugam, so you would agree, though, an if/then statement can be misleading and materially possibly so if it understates the risk going forward, the probability of it?"
217,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch, Do we need to decide the difference between what you're advocating and the virtual certainty -- what you're calling the virtual certainty standard?  Is that necessary to a decision here?
218,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," A couple questions. On the risk factors, as I understand it, you don't have to identify the probability of the event occ urring, correct?"
219,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Right. And, second, the SEC, I think you're acknowledging, could adopt a regulation that says what it currently says about risk factors and added:  And, by the way, if you're identifying possible future events that could create harm, you also need to identify if those events have occurred in the past?"
220,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," So, Mr. Shanmugam, you said that this is about context and about the regulatory context, but it seems to me, based on a lot of the hypothetica ls that you've gotten and the ones written in the briefs, that it's about more than just the regulatory context but also about the context of the business, the nature of the risk,  et cetera, which makes it not easily susceptible to a categorical rule. Let's just say  --you know, Justice Gorsuch was asking you to kind of articulate where the line might be. It's hard for me to see why we would adopt the virtual certainty test when it's nobody's first choice. And it seems like the kind of bright -- bright -line rule that maybe the SEC might want to adopt,  that sort of thing, but it's hard for me to see why we would do that. Assume that I think the Ninth Circuit's rule goes too far and I think your rule goes too far. It seems to me very hard to articulate what the line is. And -- and -- and  maybe I can put it this way. It seems like the hardest hypotheticals are the ones where the risks are either unusual or devastating, like a 50 percent loss of a factory because of a fire or getting hit by space junk. Those are  -- those are things that are unusual and hard. You know, nobody would think that a social media company wouldn't be at ris k of data breaches or that data breaches hadn't happened in the past. Or, if you're a food supply chain, you know, E. coli outbreaks in spinach, you know, that sort of thing. If things are going to recur and they're things you associate with the business and they're described at a relatively high level of generality, it seems to me that those kinds of statements, well, maybe those do seem like they're general statements just about the category of risk that a particular kind of business faces, but if they are more unusual, kind of either/or binary choices, make or break the business, well, then those really seem like they're misleading. So, if I see it that way, how do I articulate a rule that handles anything more than the case in front of us?"
221,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," No, I guess my question is, why aren't you making a statement with your purely futuristic formulation that leads the reasonable investor to believe that no harm of this nature is going to happen right -- right now, right now?"
222,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," Mr. Russell, what else should Facebook have provided in the 105 statement to comply with 10b?"
223,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Well, exactly  -- well, who -- how are we supposed to parse whether it's slipping on my steps or, you know, what you say is actionable in this case?"
224,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Well, Mr. Russell, on that, so  -- so I just want to make sure, there -- there seems to be a -- a point of agreement not only on the question actually presented but that forward -looking risk factor statements don't generally imply anything. There has to be some implied representation about a past fact for you to get in the door. Is  --is that right?  Is that common ground?"
225,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch, But it depends upon an implied representation that there is nothing -- no problem in the past?
226,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Everybody seems to  -- you guys agree on that at least. What about the statement we have here? I  -- I want some help with that because it -- I wonder whether we're in the  -- the world of a meteorite or  --or Justice Alito's falling debris or whether we're in the Chief Justice's world of slip-and-fall on my front porch. Defendant represented that our industry is prone to cyber attacks. It says that hacking has become more prevalent in our industry, and it says we cannot assure you that the measures we have will provide absolute security. Why isn't this  --given those kinds of warnings, wher e is the implied representation that Meta has never had a significant data breach?"
227,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Yeah. Well, that's the next paragraph, and it -- it -- it does say that we provide limited information. However, if they fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices or in the event of a breach of their networks, you're going to have a problem. So, again, where is the implied representation that  -- that this hasn't happened in the past?  Isn't this exactly the sort of thing that a reasonable investor does know can happen to large companies with --"
228,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," So you're saying that it is unusual because it wasn't  -- you're saying it wasn't a data breach. It was Facebook, Meta just handing over the data. You're saying it falls more in the category of a factory half burning to the ground, something that we wouldn't necessarily expect because you would have trusted Meta not to hand it over. Is that what you're saying?"
229,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," -- without any real controls, isn't that right?  Isn't that the allegation?"
230,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," Mr. Russell, can I just ask you one other question?  You know, Justice Gorsuch and  -- and the Chief too were kind of trying to pin you down on exactly what you think about these if/then statements or these statements of risk, and you agreed that sometimes they might be purely forward-looking, right?"
231,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett, And you said:  But they can contain implied representations. And -- and I think Mr. Shanmugam's position is that ordinarily they don't. And is yours that they ordinarily do?
232,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Well, doesn't that raise what for me is a kind of separation of powers or due process concern?  The SEC knows how to write regulations that require disclosure of past events. As we've discussed, they have those kinds of regulations. And what happens here is this regulation does not explicitly require that, and then the question is:  Okay, why not let the SEC do that if they want to?  And then we have this regulation. And you say sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't, in response to Justice Barrett and the Chief, and you said it can sometimes contain an implied representation. If you're the regulated party, you don't have fair notice, one could say, of what you're required to do. It's guesswork about when you're required to disclose. And you're going to therefore  --another problem that they raise, and I just want you to respond to all this  --that you're going to just over-disclose then and that's going to defeat the whole purpose of it. So I guess the starting point is, why not let the SEC do this if they want to?  Isn't there a notice problem when you do it this way? And doesn't that, in turn, lead to over-disclosures, which undermines the whole kind of theory here?"
233,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," But you  -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just want to get this one point out and you can keep going. A lot of SEC regulations do specifically require disclosure of things in the past, correct?"
234,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Let me give you these two situations. This is what most troubles me about your -- your argument, although, as I -- I tried to bring out in questioning Mr. Shanmugam, I see problems with his as well. Suppose a company  -- let's go back to the fire example. Suppose a company does an internal  --has an inspector come  -- come in. The inspector examines the factory and says your wiring has -- has got to be replaced, but it can't be done in less than six months and that  there is an X percentage chance that there's going to be a fire in your factory in the next year. Do they have to disclose  --if -- and they say in their -- in the 10 -- in answering the 10 -K, if there is a fire, there may be a significant disruption of our operations. Do  they have to disclose that internal report and say we know that there is an X percent chance that a fire is going to occur?"
235,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," So is that why you're sticking with  --with that -- it has to be a statement that is -- that would cause a listener to infer a fact about the past is untrue?  I mean, I'm sort of with Justice Alito in trying to understand the probability of risk and whether a statement can also be misleading if it would lead to an inference that the risk of future harm is zero or very low when the speaker knows it to be much greater than that. Why isn't that another kind of misleadingness that we should be thinking about or that the SEC was thinking about? "
236,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," I'm very confused. I thought, when Justice Alito put in his two hypotheticals or asked which of these two situations, something happened and it has continuing risk, or something happened, no risk, but it might happen  -- something like it might happen in the future. This situation presents both, doesn't it?"
237,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," This case, as Mr. Shanmugam indicated, is about falsity. And so  at what point do we analyze that?  The event took place in -- the misuse, in 2015?"
238,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas, So the -- do we just look at that period to determine whether or not the statement is false?
239,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," Because you made a big  -- you made a big issue of the materiality part, which is -- and the harm, that later on they find out when there's full disclosure that you've got a hundred billion dollar loss, 30 million people's data has been -- have been -- has been d isclosed, et cetera. So at what point do we analyze the falsity?"
240,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," But we're not talking about materiality at this point, right?"
241,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas, So how do you know in 2016 whether or not it was going to have the downstream -- the later effect of a hundred billion dollars in market cap drop  -- loss?
242,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," Yeah. And, finally, what role does the fact that this is at the motion -to-dismiss stage play in our analysis?"
243,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Justice Alito? Justice Sotomayor, anything further? Justice Gorsuch, anything?"
244,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," I just want to clarify, in response to Justice Sotomayor and Justice Alito, exactly what you think that the question is before us. I thought the question was, in a situation where you disclose the risk of an event occurring in the future that could cause harm, is it false not to disclose that the  event -- is that statement false because you don't disclose that that same event had happened in the past even though the harm from that event in the past is over?"
245,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Okay. I'll read the transcript on that. Okay. And then the second thing, on Justice Thomas's point, I mean, getting past the motion, just to put the real world into this for a second, getting past the motion to dismiss is kind of  --it's the game, right?"
246,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson, Just to quickly clarify your response to Justice Kavanaugh. So it's your view that this past event did present a risk of future business harm?
247,2024.23-980-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," And so that's why you think their question presented doesn't accurately capture what was going on, because they sort of sug gest that it doesn't?"
248,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," Was it considered significant in 2016 when they filed -- filed the statement, the 105 statement?"
249,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.", Do you -- do you agree with Mr. Russell that a probabilistic statement sometimes implies that the event hadn't occurred and sometimes implied that the event had occurred?
250,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Well, in such a complicated scenario of that sort, sometimes it's yes, sometimes it's no. It depends on the particular context. That does seem something that it would be nice for your -- or something that your client, the Securities and Exchange Commission, might want to exercise its expertise with respect to it. Instead, it, I think, was suggested earlier that this is a good case where we, the Court, can provide a lot of guidance on how you should apply these things. Are you concerned about that, that we may not do as good a job as the SEC?"
251,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Well, under what circumstances does a statement that is framed like this, if X event occurs, then our business will be hurt, under what circumstances does a statement that is framed like that imply that the event is not going to happen?"
252,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Well, it's  --so it's a  -- it isn't a false implication if the risk of the thing happening in the past is more than some quantity, it's more than X, the risk has to be more than X in order for that -- a statement like that to be misleading?"
253,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," I'm positing that the statement says exactly what I said it says. It says that if  --if there is a fire in the plant, our operations will be disrupted. It's framed like that. Under what circumstances is that misleading?"
254,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Okay. Well, I don't want to dw ell on things that fall out of the sky, but what about the situation where the fire is caused by something that's utterly freakish? Something fell -- a meteor -- a meteorite fell out of the sky or some crazy person who was hearing voices decided that that person was going to go throw a Molotov cocktail in the window of this plant."
255,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," -- even in those situations,  it's caused by a meteorite or it's caused by the crazy Molotov cocktail thrower, you would say you've got to disclose that because a reasonable investor would want to know?"
256,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Is that, you know, 50 percent of the capacity had been wiped out, right?"
257,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," -- it  --it -- it does seem to me we're talking about two totally different things, risks in the future and damages from the past, and if we're talking about damages from the past, how is that a risk factor that's clearly covered by one  -- 105 as opposed to something that should be disclosed perhaps in 101 or 303, first of all?  And, second of all, if you want to cram in risks from past events into 105, why would we do that given the adoption of 106, which addresses these kinds of very problems and doesn't require that?"
258,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Sotomayor?"
259,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," But, as to things that are material, you don't seem to be imposing any higher bar. In other words, that seems to be your only dividing line, is it material or is it not. And I guess maybe this goes back to Justice Barrett's question too. Is there some higher standard that we might use in this area to prevent a mass of cases that are perhaps less viable, less meritorious than this one might be thought?"
260,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," Sorry to prolong this, but to what extent does that incentivize companies to just be more general in their disclosures?  I mean, you said, if they raise it up a level of generality, it's less likely to be misleading, so you're going to have more  -- more useles s disclosures, potentially, out -- out of this. Is the SEC concerned about that?  I mean, you know, our -- our  --our ad revenue might be harmed if our reputation's at risk from anything we do."
261,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," You said there's no fair notice issue here. I guess  -- I guess I'm not really seeing that, because all the hypotheticals have illustrated a lot of uncertainty about when a company would be required to disc lose and why not. But that blends back into the question I raised earlier and the Chief raised, which is: Why can't the SEC just write a reg?  It's very simple, I think, to add to 105 something like:  When the company discloses the risk of a future event that could cause harm, also disclose any past occurrences of that event."
262,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Well, why -- I mean, why does the judiciary  have to walk the plank on this and  -- and answer that question when the SEC could do it with all the uncertainty and all the hypotheticals that have arisen, which, in turn, at least as I see it, just speaking for myself, raises a lot of questions for companies about what they have to disclose and what they don't? And they're, of course, going forward  -- going -- looking backward, they're going to be stuck with liability. Going  forward, they're just going to disclose everything --"
263,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Mr. Barber, I think I heard you tell Justice Gorsuch that your position is  -- has been the settled law. Did I hear you correctly?"
264,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Outside of the Ninth Circuit?  I mean, what I'm getting at is I'm wondering how your position differs from the  virtual certainty test that several other circuits apply. Is it different?"
265,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Does the government's position differ from the virtual certainty rule as it already exists?  I mean as it exists?  You're  -- you're saying that Mr. Shanmugam has mischaracterized what the virtual certainty rule requires. But, as the law actually exists, as you described it, does the SEC's position  differ from that?  Would we be shifting the law if we  -- if we go your way, do -- do -- do those circuits now have it wrong?"
266,2024.23-980-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Mr. Shanmugam, rebuttal?  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS"
267,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," Mr. Unikowsky, would you have the same objection if Alabama requ ired these claims to be made in a lower state court?"
268,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," Well, what's the difference?  If it's  -- if -- if -- let's say -- and I'm just speculating -- that it required that it goes to something the equivalent of a  municipal court before it -- before it goes to its trial court, how is that different from going to an agency?  Isn't it a similar exhaustion problem?"
269,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," What if, instead of the requirement you're complaining -- the exhaustion requirement, what if the requirement were simply that parties had to go through a mediation process?  I think several jurisdictions have that. I mean, it may -- it may not last long, but before you can proceed with your suit, you have to sit down, and there's a mediator that sees  --tries to see if you can work it out."
270,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Mr. Unikowsky, when did the state statute of limitations start running, or has it?"
271,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Has it expired for federal purposes?  You know, if your  --if your plaintiffs -- if your plaintiffs -- if your clients were to file in federal court  --"
272,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," And just out of curiosity, why didn't you file a lawsuit in  federal court?  Why did you go to state?"
273,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," They said both things, not just that you have to exhaust trying to get your remedies, but you have to go to the very agency you're accusing of a due process violation to cure it, correct?"
274,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," All right. Just so I'm clear in my own mind, I think what Justice Ba rrett was getting at, and I -- and I'm not sure I understand this completely, how this  would work, can you go to state court?  You can't go to federal court to claim a due process violation until you've been denied the process, correct?"
275,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," So, if you  -- do you really have a workable alternative to go to federal court as opposed to state court?"
276,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," You have to file with the state to claim the benefits to start with, correct?"
277,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor, And so you have to be there. So how and when can you go to federal court?
278,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," That  -- that's what I don't understand from the other side, but do you understand it?"
279,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor, So you're really stuck in a state process with a loop that you can't get out of?
280,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch, Do you  --do you have any reason to believe that Alabama doesn't recognize a futility exception requirement?
281,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch,"-- Heller was trotted out. And we -- we hear that from time to time, but that's what a futility exception exists to -- to address. And I'm just curious whether you know whether Alabama law permits a futility argument, and -- and  --and you're saying, as I understand it, that none was attempted here in any event?"
282,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," -- understand that. I think we're speaking past each other. So you -- you're -- you're saying that Alabama can't have an exhaustion requirement, correct?"
283,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," Right. But, otherwise, you'd have to exhaust, right?"
284,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," And that's what I'm getting at, okay?  So, on the federal system, you have an exhaustion requirement with a futility exception. Assuming Alabama recognizes a futility exception  -- and I'll have that question for counsel, I've done a little research on it, it seems to have one  -- why shouldn't the state be allowed to have the exact  parallel situation that you'd have on the federal system?"
285,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," What  --what does Felder -- because that is the linchpin of your argument, is that we've already decided this. So what does  --what kind of state procedural rules or rules does Felder still leave, and how would you define the scope of that?"
286,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh, -- do you view Felder as a preemption decision then?
287,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," What -- what I guess I'm confused about from your answer to Justice Kavanaugh is how the jurisdictional and neutral requirements relate to the -- the analysis in Felder. I mean, Felder's rule about whether or not it was preempted didn't seem to have anything to do with whether the rule was jurisdictional or neutral. So why do you suggest that that's somehow a way to get out of Felder's analysis about preemption?"
288,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," I mean, I'm looking at the analysis in Felder and it -- as you said subsequently, it's a direct preemption case. It says that the notice of claim statute undermines  the uniquely federal remedy that is Section 1983 in several interrelated ways. And then it talks about three ways, one of which is that it conditions the right of recovery that Congress has authorized. The second is that it discriminates against the federal right. And the third is that it  -- it looks like an exhaustion requirement, all right?  But, really, the reason it's preempted is because it undermines the federal right. And it seems to me that Alabama's law is doing all of those three interrelated things. So I don't understand why we care whether or not it's jurisdictional or whether or not it's neutral in  -- in any given sense. It's doing what Felder says you can't do because it undermines the federal right."
289,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Well, do you contest the principle that state courts are generally completely free to define the jurisdiction of their courts?"
290,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," So why isn't that body of  case law the appropriate body of case law to apply here since the Alabama Supreme Court tells us that this rule is jurisdictional?  We assume -- presumably have to accept that. This is a matter of state court jurisdiction. So why don't we look to the body of case law that explains when this general ru le that the state courts can define the jurisdiction of their own courts gives way?  I know you want to talk about Patsy and Felder, but why is that -- neither of those involves jurisdiction."
291,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Well, in Haywood, the courts -- the Court concluded that the New York rule evinced hostility toward 1983. Can that be said here, when the Alabama courts will entertain the 1983 claim,  it's just a question of when they will do it?"
292,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," You have a broad argument, Mr. Unikowsky, that if it's an exhaustion requirement, it -- it -- it can't get in the way of a lawsuit. You also have a narrower argument that has to do with this case. But what would be -- if you had to define a narrower class of cases that are preempted so that if we wanted to avoid  the question of whether all preemption -- excuse me, whether all exhaustion requirements were preempted, what would that narrower class of cases look like, and what justifies the parameters?"
293,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan, Just  -- so it would be a line about the degree of burden that's attached to the 1983 right?
294,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," I mean, it was part o f Felder's reasoning. Felder has this  -- some language that suggests a very broad rule applying to all exhaustion requirements, but then it also goes into the time limits. It has a lot to do with, like, how much burden there is on the 1983 right, and it also discusses the purposes of the statute and whether those purposes suggest a conflict with the policy of 1983. And the relationship between or among all of those things is not particularly clear from the language of the opinion. It sort of suggests that they don't really believe that there's an absolute bar when it comes to exhaustion requirements. Do you agree with that?  Do you have any, you know, views about the relationship among those three aspects of the Court's reasoning?"
295,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Mr. Unikowsky, how  -- you know, we've said in our own contexts about jurisdiction it's a term of many, many meanings, too many. How are we supposed to -- like, let's say I agree with you that the definition of jurisdiction has to be a federal one. How are we supposed to decide? Because a different test does apply, right, if this is a jurisdictional requirement than if it's just a straight-up, you know, more Felder -like scheme. So what is the test?  How do we decide if a state rule is really jurisdictional or not?"
296,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," And let me just ask you one question about how this scheme works because I agree it's very odd. Is there some mechanism when you're before this intermediate tribunal where you actually fill out a piece of paper and say, I'm asserting a due process claim in addition to my claim for benefits?  How would one even exhaust the due process portion of this?"
297,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," And are you saying that, assuming this is a state jurisdictional rule, it cannot or can be preempted?  What is -- I thought this case was about preemption, not about the characterization of the state law. So, if we agree and assume that  the state law is jurisdictional, what implication for whether or not it can be preempted by federal law?"
298,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson, And so it's a Supremacy Clause issue in terms of whether or not that has to be the outcome?
299,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh, Put aside Felder. What is the problem with just going to federal court?
300,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Well, what is the real-world problem with just going to federal court?  Or maybe there aren't any and you're just saying precedent says we can go to state court. But do you have any real-world problems with just going to federal court?"
301,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," And you mentioned this earlier, but a procedural due process claim usually requires that you go through the state processes first. Maybe that's how this case got on the -- on the wrong track. Do you agree with that?"
302,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you, counsel. I want to make sure I have your complete answer to the line of questioning I  -- I understood Justice Kagan to be pursuing, I mean  --and I think why you called this Kafkaesque, which is because you're being told you have to go to the state  -- your -- your claim is the state doesn't handle these things in a timely fashion, they lose the papers, you can't answer the phone, so why send them back? If you have to go back there, that's -- your whole point is you  -- you --you can't go back there because they do such a  --that's what you're challenging. And I just want to make sure whether  --if you had the most efficient state procedure imaginable, you know, they answer the phone on the first ring and they quickly give -- you a decision, would your argument be the same, that it doesn't matter?"
303,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.", You would -- I'm just  --you would lose?  In other words --
304,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.", You would not -- then the ruling would be you do not  -- you -- you do -- you do have to go to the state before pursuing your 1983 action?
305,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Okay. Well, then what was Kafkaesque about the process?  I  understood you to say that that was the problem, that it was  -- it imposed a burden on your -- the exercise of your  --your federal right."
306,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?"
307,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", Could you have sought mandamus in state court to get a ruling in these cases?
308,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," What if a state has a  -- a regime under which the -- the -- the person seeking the benefits first has to file the claim and then there  --there's a -- there are two levels of  -- of appellate review, administrative review, and after -- I assume that you would admit that if the case were filed in federal court, the -- the person would have to seek the benefits in the first instance, right?"
309,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," All right. And then the  -- then the -- the person says, oh, this process is too long, I -- I want a quick decision, they denied my claim. Then what?"
310,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," Counsel, I  -- you say this is not a neutral rule because, in every other case where there's a due process violation of an agent  -- of an agency's process in some way, people can go directly to state court, correct?"
311,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor, Plaintiffs who sue the government but for this particular type of benefit?
312,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor, So it is sui generis to just one class of plaintiffs on one potential constitutional violation?
313,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," I  --I guess I'm having trouble with the jurisdictional argument that my colleagues are concerned about. This is not jurisdictional in the sense of we're telling state courts that they can't hear a claim, correct?"
314,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," All right. We're not saying this is a federal claim, so it has to go to federal court. We're saying, no, you state courts have the power to hear constitutional -- 1983 constitutional claims. That your legislature permits you to do. So it's not as if they're  -- filed a neutral rule that says you can't hear 1983 claims, correct?"
315,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," And so all we're saying is you, state courts, should decide in the first instance whether there is a due process violation, correct?"
316,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," In the colloquy that you had with the Chief Justice, you started with the broad form of your argument and ended up with a narrower form, a much narrower form. In the delta between the two, it seems to me you're going to lose on the merits anyway. In other words, if somebody goes in and says, I got $100, I really deserve $200, they didn't listen to a certain category of evidence, that's a due process violation. You know, you've not made the argument, they're just  going to throw you out, whether it's -- you call it on the merits or for  -- for -- because your claim isn't ripe. So why should we go to the broad form of the argument when nobody's going to win in that category of cases anyhow?"
317,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," This new narrow theory, what  --what exactly does it encompass? What class of cases?"
318,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch, When it's impossible to exhaust?  Is that  --is that another way of saying it?
319,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," I'm not sure I've got it, bu t let me try. That it's impossible to bring your claim?"
320,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," Okay. And what if it's not impossible here because of mandamus, because you might have a futility argument?  We just don't know. Then what?"
321,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," Well, I think all of this is kind of new, to be honest with you, this  --this narrow theory. I  -- I read your brief as pressing the broad theory, but here we are. Let -- let's say we just don't know whether it is truly impossible here. What do we do then?"
322,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," What if they're the same sorts of conditions that exist in the federal administrative realm?  When we're  dealing with a federal benefit and an agency doesn't rule, I'd make a futility argument and I'd maybe mandamus the agency."
323,2024.23-191 -t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," I just want to clarify your answer to Justice Gorsuch. He asked you to stick to the narrow theory, but to answer, you reverted to the broad one, that Patsy just precludes exhaustion requirements generally. If we do not agree with your reading of Patsy, can you articulate  --try one more time to articulate that narrow theory that doesn't rely on Patsy?"
324,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," Well, Mr. Unikowsky's argument as I understand it is that the exhaustion rules in Alabama makes it impossible for  -- for him to pursue the due process cl aims that he has under 1983. So would you respond to that?"
325,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," -- but the point is that it's inconsistent with the purposes of the federal statute. Second, the notice provision discriminates against the federal right, and it talks about the differences in the time limits in a way that discriminates. And then, finally, it operates in part as an exhaustion requirement. Now I appreciate that your counsel on the other side is just homing in on the  exhaustion requirement, but Felder seems to take it even beyond that. So can you explain why  Alabama's law is not doing the three things tha t mattered in Felder to the preemption analysis?"
326,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Right. But can you talk about the purposes of the federal statute, right?"
327,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," -- with the reasons or the goals the federal statute was there. So isn't a requirement like Alabama's, which prohibits the ability to bring a due process claim under these circumstances,  inconsistent with Section 1983, which is supposed to be giving people the ability to make these kinds of claims?"
328,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," So your argument at bottom is that this is consistent with Congress's objectives in 1983?  Because I understood that to be the sort of umbrella consideration with respect to preemption, which is what I thought we were talking about here."
329,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson, Has anybody ever recovered in 1983 making these kinds of claims in Alabama state court that you're aware of?
330,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," So can I ask about the dimensions of your argument in two different ways?  I'll give you just a couple hypotheticals. So one is suppose we take this out of the employment context. We're not talking about a benefit of any kind. There's a person who has, like, a quintessential 1983 claim, which is the improper use of police force, and Alabama sets up a scheme where you have to go to the police department first and you have to go through these three levels of review before you can bring that to court. Is that perfectly okay?  Does  -- or does that change matters?"
331,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Elena Kagan, I  --I don't understand. What makes it more suspect?
332,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," -- that look an awful lot like Haywood itself, a -- a rule that evinces hostility to the 1983 claim?  Because  there's no tradition of requiring this sort of thing when a plaintiff wants to sue -- wants to bring a classic Fourth Amendment 1983 claim."
333,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Okay. I'm not sure I can capture exactly what his narrow argument is. But suppose the narrow argument is that there's no exhaustion requirement in a 1983 case in state court, where it is, as a practical matter, impossible or extraordinarily onerous to get a decision. How would the state be hurt by that? What would be wrong with that?"
334,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," But it  --it -- couldn't it be, though, that in some of those cases at least, where it's truly impossible and  it really is a Catch 22, that that is evincing hostility to the plaintiffs' claims and a Felder argument might be made there?"
335,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," How about if -- you know, in Felder, there is a lot of talk about the time limits. Here, the time limits are even more stringent than they were in Felder. Suppose we make them even more stringent still, and let's add another bunch of things. Let's say that instead of three levels of review, there are five levels of review. Let's say between each level you have to proceed  within five days, and then you have to bring your court claim at the very end within five days. Let's say we have empirical evidence that suggests that because the state administrative process is very slow, it takes an average of 10 years to actually get to court. At that point, can we say that this is so  -- so onerous a process that it has to be in conflict with 1983?"
336,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," But the expert -- oh. The expertise is in adjudicating the entitle  -- entitlement to unemployment, not the due process claim, right?"
337,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," So tell me -- and this is just the clarifying question I was trying to ask Mr. Unikowsky  -- how does one assert these due process claims, say, before the intermediate tribunal?  Is there a mechanism for doing that?  It just seems like everything that was a description in the briefs was  talking about how to pursue getting your unemployment benefit. How does one go about making this due process argument before the agency?"
338,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," You're making your position seem benign, but we have amicus briefs  from a wide variety of groups, from ACLU and Public Citizen to religious liberty groups, to the Chamber of Commerce, all of which say that your rule will really hinder federal civil rights claims from getting into state court. The religious liberty plaintiffs say that your position would ""grind religious litigants into submission before they are able  to have their claims heard in court.""  We see the same thing from the ACLU's brief. You want to respond to that?"
339,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh, They  -- don't they guard against it by saying that exhaustion is not a requirem ent before you bring a 1983 suit in state court?
340,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," You have just one more. You  -- you've invoked federalism and respect for states, but I think the practical effect of your rule, if we were to adopt it, would be everyone or most people would go more quickly to federal court and haul the state before federal court. I'm just  --the irony of that, can you comment on that?"
341,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Well, these kinds of claims, if you had problems, you know, a free exercise problem, a religion problem, or a procedural due process problem with the unemployment scheme in Alabama, you're just going to go to federal court, right?"
342,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," That's the point of suppressing the federal right in state court, isn't it?  If you make the hoops so difficult to go through, then they have no remedy. Here, Mr. Williams was thrown out of -- out of the state process because he didn't receive notice because he was unconscious because of COVID, and he's had no remedy in their state court. So, basically, what you're really saying is no, we're not hostile to a federal right because we know we're going to win no matter what we do."
343,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Can I just get you to focus in quickly on Felder, and you -- you've said many times that you see that case as the problem being about minimizing liability. But I'm quoting from the case when it says that this is ""essentially""  --""the question is essentially one of preemption. Is the application of the state's law to Section 1983 actions brought in state courts consistent with the goals of the federal civil rights laws, or does the enforcement of such a requirement instead stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes of the objectives of Congress?""  I thought we were thinking about is  it an obstacle, is it consistent?  And what I'm  worried about is that if we start moving away from that conception of what it means to be preempted, that same kind of thought process and  doctrine is used in other laws, not just 1983. For example, we have the Federal Arbitration Act, which has a preemption standard that is almost identical to what Felder just said about whether or not it's consistent. And we've repeatedly said that state laws that do things like  -- you know, related to contracts, et cetera, et cetera, are preempted by the FAA for the very same reasons. So can you help us not to be concerned about shifting the standard of what it means to preempt and the way in which that might actually implicate other preemption doctrines and other laws?"
344,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," -- is it an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution?  And I got to tell you, in the Concepcion case in AT&T versus Mobility, that exact same concept is governing what the Court is doing with respect to preemption. So, if we move from that, if we're focused more on minimizing liability or whatever else you say you think Felder means, I'm worried that that's going to bleed over into these other kinds of preemption areas."
345,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," You believe that plaintiffs here could have brought suit immediately in federal court, is that right?"
346,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito? Justice Sotomayor? Justice Kagan?"
347,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Your friend on the other side said, if it went to federal court, there might be a ripeness issue and an abstention issue. What are your thoughts?"
348,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Okay. And I take your point that -- as I understand it, it's -- your argument is it's hard for this to be  -- an exhaustion requirement of administrative agency processes to be an obstacle that's improper given that the federal government has similar administrative exhaustion requirements. But there does seem to be a tremendous record of difficulty of  --of individuals accessing that administrative process here. What assurance do you have or can you give us that  --that  --that the State is addressing these claims in -- in a proper and timely manner?"
349,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch, Was some of that backlog due to COVID or -- or other things?
350,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," I asked Mr. Unikowsky about the state statute of limitations. I'm going to ask you the same question. When does the state statute of limitations start running on these claims?  And to clarify, my concern is, if somehow the state statute of limitations is running, you know, because the due process violation has already begun in the agency, is it  the case that that statute of limitations might run in state, for purposes of state court, before they can even get there?"
351,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," Okay. My other question is:  So a couple times in your brief you called the agency proceeding a proper proceeding for redress under 1983, and you said there's no reason for this Court to distinguish between bringing a 1983 claim in something that's called a court versus sending it to an agency. Is that somehow different than the exhaustion requirement?  Can you just  --"
352,2024.23-191 -t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," So is the argument  --I mean, I guess I'm trying to distinguish between an exhaustion requirement, which is almost kind of like a pregame thing, you know, it's a -- it's a threshold. And this makes it sound like, if you're saying this is part of the 1983 claim itself or part of the adjudication, it's  actually not a delay of the 1983 claim. But is your argument instead that this is actually part of adjudicating the constitutional violatio n?"

355,2024.23-217-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, How would you respond -- what do you have to say about Respondents' public/private right or private/public right argument?
356,2024.23-217-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," How are we supposed to  -- you make the argument that the higher standard applies in, you know, termination of parental rights and all that. But how are we supposed to make the judgment that the concern to remediate dire labor situations when this Act was passed are similarly worthy of a heightened standard?  You know, the disparity in, you know, barga ining power between the people who are seeking the wages and the employer and all that."
357,2024.23-217-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Well, how do we apply the particularly important individual  interest then in thinking about the cases that have had a heightened standard because they seem to distinguish cases involving mere money?  I think that's the phrase. But, when it's minimum wage, it's not mere money in the same way, I  guess, to follow up on the Chief Justice's question. How are we supposed to make those  value judgments, I guess?"
358,2024.23-217-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Are you saying  -- and, relatedly, are you saying we should never expand the category of where we've done clear and convincing, the Addington category?"
359,2024.23-217-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," Can I just ask a practical question?  You asked us to vacate and remand. The SG wants us to reverse, which  usually suggests to me that they think the judgment below can't be sustained under any reading. And the other side says, regardless of the standard, affirm. Our practice is to  remand. But what outcome could a different standard of proof have on the factual findings in this case?"
360,2024.23-217-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," All right?  So I don't think we should get into that. The court below should. But I'm asking you, why isn't it harmless  error?"

364,2024.23-217-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Can I ask you, you started off by saying that the default standard of proof was the preponderance of the evidence standard and that it's a matter of cong ressional intent, and so I guess the question is how clear was it as of 1938, when the FSLA was passed, that preponderance of the evidence was the standard of proof as a default? The cases  -- many of the cases that are cited are actually post-1938 cases. So what's the best evidence that Congress was actually legislating against the preponderance of the evidence standard?"
365,2024.23-217-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas, Would this be a bit stronger case on Respondents' part if Respondent had a minimum wage claim?
366,2024.23-217-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Did I understand your opening to -- to say that if  it's just money, you wouldn't address the clear and convincing standard at all?"
367,2024.23-217-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But what do we do about the fact that the money damages here are actually, I thought, doing more significant work than just providing damages in that particular scenario?  So, I mean, when Congress enacted the FSLA  --the FLSA, they talked about the fact that there were interests at stake that were beyond money damages, that setting up the statute in the way that they did ensured that  businesses don't gain a competitive advantage by misclassifying employees. It protects certain groups from substandard wages and thereby protecting health and well -being. There was also the notion of spreading employment through the application of this law. So isn't this more than just money damages?  I mean, I take your point that it might not be denaturalization, but I would think the government would say the interests go beyond just pure money damages."
368,2024.23-217-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Can I ask you, is this the same standard of proof that would apply  to the government, the Department of Labor, if it is bringing suit to enforce the FLSA?"

374,2024.23-217-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," So the district court is going to look at this and say, well, I evaluated this under clear and convincing and decided this, but if it's just preponderance, it comes out the other way?"

382,2024.23-217-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," So I'm discerning a methodological difference between the two of you that I'd like to ask about. Petitioner said that the standard of proof question is ultimately a matter of congressional intent. And I take you to be  pushing back on that a little bit by your opening when you said that when there's no constitutional requirement and Congress is silent, the standard of proof is a question traditionally left to the judiciary, and you  seem to be inviting us to be weighing these values. And I thought, at least the way Petitioner has set this up, is that it's not our role to do that, that what we should be doing, she says, is determining whether Congress's silence meant that it acquiesced to the default rule, which is preponderance of the evidence. So can you speak to the differenc e of methodology?"
383,2024.23-217-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But isn't that because they were sort of -- I think everyone concedes that there's this kind of special category of cases that based on their interest, whether it's a constitutional interest or sort of quasi-constitutional because of the nature of the deprivation, due process kind of thing, the Court has work to do. But I thought we sort of got rid of that at the top by sort of assessing this not as being in one of those categories, and so then the question becomes:  How does the Court treat it?"
384,2024.23-217-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But what do you do with Grogan?  I mean, I thought from then on, the sort of way in which we thought about this was Congress  --you know, there's no constitutional interest here, Congress didn't speak to it. So what does Congress's silence tell us about what it intended with respect to the cause of action that it was creating?"
385,2024.23-217-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Did it do so on the basis of the Court's own view of the interests in stake, or was it trying to ascertain how Congress viewed those interests?"
386,2024.23-217-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan, Do you think that there are any other contexts in which we should say clear and convincing evidence?
387,2024.23-217-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Well, you said it's up to the courts to figure this out, so I'm just wonder ing:  Is this a kind of this case and this case only?  And if so, why?  Or is this  --is the argument:  No, there are a variety of areas in which it should be a clear and  convincing evidence because of, you know, the following reasons?"
388,2024.23-217-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Well, the  government provides lots of benefits that are critically  -- monetary benefits that are critically important to some people. Would you have us say that none  of those can rise to the level of importance that is present when what's involved is overtime payments under the FLSA?"

391,2024.23-217-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Well, but, I mean, I think it's the same point Justice Alito was making. The Clean Water Act, right? There's a big statement of purposes there. It's necessary to preserve life and -- and everything  else. And so, if you want -- if you're suing somebody under that, why aren't they put to -- they, the polluter  -- a higher standard of proof to prove that they're not doing  --they're not polluting the environment, they're not endangering people's lives and -- through the -- through their emissions?"
392,2024.23-217-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," So could you say a little bit more about nonwaivability?  Because that  --that is the one thing that you have that seems, on your account, to make this, the FLSA, different from a variety of other things that we could think of. I mean, is that right?  Are there really no other nonwaivability rules of the same kind?  And, if so, where did this one come from?  Why does it exist?"

That  --much of that is collected under a debt collection provision that authorizes the  government to collect its -- a debt owed to it. That seems somewhat at odds with your argument that it's not the government's money. How could it be collected under that Act if it is not owed to the government?

398,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," So I guess I don't understand your argument about ""provides.""  Can  you help me?  Because it seems to me that you're saying that because the government here has ordered these telecom companies to pay directly  into the fund, it is not ""provides,"" but if the government had ordered the telecom companies to pay them a fee, for example, and then directed that into the fund, it would be ""provides.""

I mean, you have this pot of money that's the public fisc, and in my second scenario, the government is exacting a fee from the telecom companies, and while it mi ght be put into the public fisc for two seconds, the point is  they're exacting the fee to pay for this fund.

It seems like your argument  rests on the premise that only one person can provide, and I'm not really sure why that's true. I was thinking of an example of  -- think back to the days when  proctors used to give out test booklets and pencils. So let's say that I'm working as a proctor. It would be perfectly natural for me to say to the students: I'm going to provide each of you with a pencil and a booklet. Now I didn't go out and purchase those with my own money. The school presumably provided them to me and then I provided them to the students. I mean, I think one person doesn't have to provide. I think we could say that the United States provided funds, for example, that it  -- this hundred million dollars that it got through debt collection, et cetera, and then also say that the carriers provided money to the funds through their fees or that the carriers provided funds to the United States, which was a conduit. I just don't understand. I mean, are you assuming that ""provides"" has to be  exclusive, that there's one ultimate provider?"

409,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," Your earlier answer suggests to me that you think you -- that this case won't end this matter unless we rule on the government  -- on the Respondent's first ground, that this is a government program in total, correct?  Because what you're  -- I think what you're saying is we  --if our ruling relies simply on the hundred million, that your next case is going to be:  Okay, I'll accept that, but I'm going to fight about whatever the recovery is under the False Claims Act. That's what you just said to me."
410,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," If we say they provide at least a hundred million, is your argument going to be that recovery is limited to that hundred million or that recovery, assuming you go under the False Claims Act, that recovery is limited to a hundred million, or are you going to take this position you're now taking,  that the government hasn't suffered any harm so that nothing would come to the government?"
411,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor, So this case doesn't end. Then you're going to argue that their damages have to be limited to a hundred million?  What are you going to argue?
412,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," Assume there's a  finding of fraud, that you should have paid more -- you should have given them a greater discount than you did. So assume you  --you lose the fraud parts. Are we back to a case where you're  going to claim the damages are limited because?"
413,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," And let's assume you lose on the  -- on the -- on the merits of the trial. And I know those are unpleasant assumptions, but work with me a minute. I think you would have open to you two arguments. One, that the hundred million dollars is not traceable to the losses in this case because the funds didn't follow through. I assume you'd make that argument, is that correct?"
414,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," And then I'm  -- I'm -- I'm detecting in your colloquy with Justice Sotomayor that you might make an additional argument that damages would be limited to a  hundred million dollars in any event, is that correct?"
415,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," In your brief, you mentioned constitutional avoidance, and I'm, I guess, having trouble connecting that argument to this case in the sense of how it would be any more or less unconstitutional if -- the overall scheme -- if we disagreed with you here. So can you connect that up?"
416,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Okay. So I'm just picking a number. Let's say it's $20,000. If that money -- if the government itself had been directly defrauded of that money and you had treble damages, it would be $60,000. I think what -- what -- if I -- if -- I have the same question that they do. My question is:  If you get to that point and  you're trying to calculate damages sustained to the government, are you going to say:  Yeah,  it's 60,000 once you treble it, just like it would be if they were dealing directly with the government?  Or would you say:  No, we have to calculate the marginal cost to the government in some kind of way?  Or you might say:  It's zeroed out. Like, the government didn't actually sustain any damage here. And so then it doesn't mean that the relator gets nothing because then there are other penalties and fines that are available under the FCA. That's my question."
417,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," But is the relevant number that the relator, in your view, would be aiming at the $20,000 that I'm hypothesizing, or would it be some marginal cost to the government, or, as a matter of law, for a jury instruction, would you be saying, you know, it' s zero because the government didn't actually suffer any loss?  Even though the government provided the hundred million dollars, the damages sustained to the government were none?"
418,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," You've said this many times and that there is, you said, a historical link between the public fisc and the FCA. And I guess I'm looking at the history and I don't really see it that way, so I'd like for you to respond. You know, as I read the history of the FCA, the purpose is broader than just trying to protect the public fisc. In fact, when Congress passed in 1986 the amendments where ""claim"" -- the ""claim"" definition that we're talking about here was put into the statute, it also had a report that talked about what it was doing, and that GAO report documented widespread fraud in government programs and focused on ""the non-monetary effects"" of the fraud and Congress's concern that it wasn't just about the money. It talked about things like the loss of confidence in government programs. It pointed to incidents in which the beneficiaries of the program did not get the benefits that Congress wanted them to get. So it was clearly beyond the fiscal impact. And so what I guess I'm wondering is: Doesn't that sort of undermine your argument that all we need to care about here is looking at this through the lens of whether or not the government has actual monetary skin in the game in this way?"
419,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," Mr. Singh, if this had been an appropriated fund and the administrator had been an federal agency, this would be, of course, a very straightforward case. We'd know exactly what the government's  financial stake was. But this is private money from private parties to another private party, and it's very difficult to see what the government's financial stake is. And I think it's  --it -- you might ultimately conclude, or we might, that it is enough to be federal funds. But it doesn't look like federal funds. It looks like private funds. So, in this -- in this instance, would you explain exactly what  the government's financial stake is here?  It hasn't appropriated any monies, it hasn't given any grants, and it hasn't lost anything. No matter what happens here, the government's not out of pocket."
420,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," If  -- if we're persuaded by your argument on the hundred million dollars, it seems to me a difficult question whether or not that sort of -- whatever a non-pejorative word for ""taints"" is, in other words, whether that determines the characteristic of the other umpteen billion dollars. I mean, if  --if it were 10 million, would that be enough to characterize the entire rest of the fund, or $1?  Or are you limited with respect to, whether it's damages or whatever, to the percent of money that you actually collect?"
421,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," -- your frontline argument is, if it's a dollar, the entire billion -dollar account is government funds?"
422,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Mr. Singh, on  --on the hundred million, just to wrap that up, so there is no traceability argument, so that takes us to the question of damages. Would a ruling on the hundred million point in your favor cause you any heartburn when  it comes to damages and, if so, what would it be?"
423,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Would it be, or -- or would that be relevant at all under the damages provision?"
424,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch, So you'd take the position that the hundred million is not the upper limit?
425,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch, So your  -- is your first preference then it provides all the money?
426,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," And  --and, there, there's some complications too because Congress added the word ""agent"" in 2009, and  some of your claims predate that, right?"
427,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," I -- I -- I get that. But  -- but --but your frontline argument is it provides all. And that would be your preference because  -- over the hundred million, for the obvious reasons we've discussed, it would be your preference over the agency line of reasoning because of 2009?"
428,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," That  -- that's a huge difference, I think, in practice. I mean, all taxes come into a government account and then go out. And with the hundred million, you can really analogize to how the -- almost the entire federal appropriations process works, right?  So that's why the word ""provides"" there -- I think the other side has a little bit of trouble on the hundred million, but then, when you get to the rest of it, it seems like you have a -- a bit of a problem because the word ""provides"" does not to me at least ordinarily fit when the government orders one private party to provide money to another private party, which is, when we get outside the hundred million, what I think is going on here. But correct me if I'm wrong or respond otherwise."
429,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," That's  -- on the -- again, on the bigger argument, that's critical?"
430,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," But, Mr. Singh, just to give an example maybe in aid of Justice Kavanaugh's line of thinking  --we've had some colorful ones. This is less colorful, I admit -- but  a court order ordering a judgment, plaintiff, you get money from defendant. Does the court provide that money or does the defendant provide that money and in -- if  -- if  so, what makes that example different?"
431,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," -- and it did through government coercion in the same way that we have here, right?  It's  -- it's, you know, on pains of going to jail if you don't do it. So what  --what's the difference?"
432,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," -- entire civil litigation system  -- under what you're describing as government program, the entire civil litigation system is a ""government program""?"
433,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," On your theory of ""provides,"" why wouldn't it be?  Put aside, you know, the government hasn't contended or  --"
434,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Which you've connected to the word ""program"" as opposed to ""fisc.""  That's a key move in your argument, I think, government program rather than government fisc. The word ""provides"" goes to government program. Under your theory of that, why isn't the civil litigation system a government program that  --in which the government is providing the money, in Justice Gorsuch's example, to the plaintiff?"
435,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Isn't the answer, Mr. Singh, about the duties that are running in the civil litigation?  In other words, the duties, the duty to pay comes from the defendant, the private person, right  --"
436,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," You're done? What  -- regardless of -- let -- let's assume you win, and regardless of whether you win on the hundred million argument or your larger argument, what are the damages sustained?"
437,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett, So it's not just the money that Wisconsin Bell took unlawfully?
438,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas, Just a matter of curiosity. What would be the difference between  the authorities of the agent as opposed to a case if  -- where there was a sub-agency that administered the fund?
439,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," The  -- here, you're saying that the private entity is an agent. So what is the difference in their authority and their liability and  -- and their conduct in -- in this E-rate program?"
440,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", Let me see if I correctly understand some of what you have just told us. The question here  -- the only question before us is whether the reimbursement requests are claims under the False Claims Act. You could win on any of three grounds. The narrowest of those would concern the 100 million. But you've argued that we should really decide the case under one of the other broader grounds because that might have an effect on a damages question that has not been briefed and we don't know whether the case will ever get to the issue of damages. Is that a correct summary of some of what you've said?
441,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Well, what if you were to  -- what if we thought that you should win under the hundred million argument but lose  under the other two?  Then I assume you wou ld prefer to just take your narrow victory and go home, right?"
442,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," That was quite fascinating. I'm still laughing over it, counsel. I -- I do want to go back to these two theories. I -- I actually thought there were three theories that you had proposed. The first  was that the entire program is a government program. The government is supplying the money because the government's setting the rate at which the contractors have to pay. They're telling the Universal Service Fund how to spend  that money. And they're creating the FCC program that qualifies carriers to receive the money. So they're controlling every aspect of  the distribution, correct?"
443,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," I think they're doing this more specifically than many of the appropriations mechanisms that we reviewed recently  --I think one of my colleagues wrote about this -- in which we have appropriations to agencies with no more guidance than says it's a continuing X amount and you spend it on these things and that's it. We have more specificity than that here, correct?"
444,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," Okay. And we have some appropriations that  --that are based on how much is collected by the -- that agency, and they're entitled to spend that, and if they don't spend that, they can save it for the future, correct?"
445,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," And that's your point, that this is very similar to those appropriation programs?"
446,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," Am I understanding your answer to her?  And if that's true, what's that something more?  What has the U.S. lost besides the fact that you should have been paid  -- that you should have paid less money, I guess?"
447,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," I understand that. I'm going back to, what else are you claiming you're entitled to besides that?  That's the part that I  don't understand."
448,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," You still haven't answered my question. What is the amount of the claim, the total claim, that's your alternative argument?"
449,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," Even though they paid a part of it?  So, if you asked for a $50,000 subsidy and they only gave you 20,  you're still entitled to the 50, or are you claiming something more?"
450,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," Could I go back to the conversation you were having with Justice Gorsuch when he gave you the other example and you said to him, no, that would not be a -- a normal use of the word ""provide"" and you said it's all a matter of context. And then you said the context here is that the administrator is acting as an agent. And is -- if we don't feel like getting into the question of exactly whether the administrator is an agent, the sort of back 10 pages of  everybody's briefs where we have to figure out, you know, does an agent have to have the power to bind the government or all that, if we just take that off the table and  --and said:  Okay, now we want a different kind of rule that separates the case in front of us from the case  that Justice Gorsuch raised, do you have another rule for that?"
451,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Mr. Singh, on  --on -- on your -- on -- on the 150 -- or the hundred million dollar option, the other side hasn't argued traceability, so that's good for you. And then the question comes to damages and whether there might be some upper limit based on the hundred million. Are you going to come anywhere near that under either theory of damages you've laid out here?"
452,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Okay. So that could be resolved in a future case. The larger ""provides"" question could be resolved in a future case without doing damage to this one?"
453,2024.23-1127-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Let me just ask one quick question. The hundred million dollars, it  seems to me, is premised on the notion that that's the government's only stake in this, that -- that -- that you have to have skin in the game as the government. Here, they have a hundred million dollars in it, so that is really why the FCA cares about this. And I guess I just am struggling with that in light of my view based on the history and the broader statute that the FCA was the government's concern about the integrity of its program, that it was trying to fund a program and have it operate and, yes, it put money into it, but it's not just the money that's at stake. Do you have a reaction to that?"
454,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, Is there  --can you recall a case similar to this FCA case?
455,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Well, you're not saying it was okay bec ause Congress did it, are you?"
456,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Mr. Suri, can you just remind me the state of play?  It was the Fifth Circuit and the Seventh Circuit here who  split, and the Seventh Circuit said, well, one reason we feel better about this is the Fifth Circuit didn't know about the hundred million. But, on the larger claim, we haven't had a lot hashed out about that in the lower courts, right?"
457,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," So, if we decided that larger question, we would be wading into something that really hasn't percolated very much?"
458,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," -- but, to resolve -- sorry. But, to resolve the current split, we now know about the hundred million dollars. The Fifth Circuit didn't know about the hundred million dollars. And if we were to rely on that, that would -- that would resolve the split as present -- presently constituted?"
459,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," And  --and just to understand your -- your distinction on the civil litigation side, as I heard you in your opening, the answer was because the government doesn't exercise control at the back end in how it's spent or how it's distributed, is that right?"
460,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," Well, what -- what about in a class action case where the court has very reticulated rules about distribution and notice and claim processing and, gosh, a lot of -- a lot of control on the back end?"
461,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch, So it's a degree of control now at the back end that's the distinction?
462,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," Yeah, but if  -- but if you -- again, it's one of those things that's happened, whether or not there's authority, right?"
463,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Counsel  -- Justice Thomas, anything further?  Justice Alito?  No? Justice Kagan?"
464,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Could you tell me more about why you want to do the broader route, what you think the damages inquiry would look like in a case like this, and what you're worried about leaving on the table?"
465,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," What argument might you think is right?  I mean, is it just you can't go over a hundred million?  Is it you can go over a hundred million?"
466,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," And are there other programs that you're thinking about when you stand up here, or is this the full universe of programs?"
467,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Mr. Suri,  if we wrote the opinion to say ""at least"" here, where the government has provided, you have all these arguments open to you and all of these hard questions could be fleshed out later, correct?"
468,2024.23-1127-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Okay. And then the other question is just in terms of  --I take that point. But, in terms of the practical consequences to you, you know, we haven't talked much about the agency argument, but, you know, for any claims that were for post -2009, the government isn't necessarily going to be getting into this whole splicing because you would be relying on the agency argument. So, even for you, there's kind of a limited time window where you would be focused on this as opposed to focusing on your agency argument, right?"
469,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," Mr. Waxman, you place quite a bit of weight on the note, notes, from Smothermon and Ackley, and from your opening statement, you clearly do not agree with them. Did you at any point get a statement from either one of the prosecutors?"
470,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, Did they make themselves unavailable?  Sorry to interrupt you.
471,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Mr. Waxman, the counsel appointed by the Court argues that a central element of your case is the jury -- that the jury would have regarded the matter differently if they knew that the lithium had been prescribed by a psychiatrist as opposed to someone else because the jury knew about the lithium and what they didn't know is that it was prescribed by a psychiatrist. Do you -- do you really think it would make that much of a difference to the jury?"
472,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," And so the fact that the jury knew he had taken lithium during incarceration doesn't tell them anything about whether he had bipolar -- a bipolar condition, that his use of drugs would have led to impulsive and violent behavior, correct?"
473,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," And would have explained the murder. Now can I go back to the two questions here?  I have three of my own, okay?"
474,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," There's a lot -- and you spent a whole lot of time in your introduction, a lot of spilt in here on whether the PCPA is an adequate and independent state ground. I'm not even sure why we're doing all that when -- you're right, the court below seemed to confuse the merits with the procedural bar, but it's very clear that a procedural bar is always waiveable under Oklahoma law. Legions of cases say that, correct?"
475,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," -- so, once you waived, the only issue before the court was the substantive issue of whether there was a violation of federal law, correct?"
476,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," So that's really the only issue before us, the procedural bar. A  lot of spilt in, goes on and on about, is this the first time they didn't waive it?  Is it not the first time they didn't waive it?  The reason that's true is because they accept the waiver when there's a violation of a right, and they don't accept the waiver when there's no violation of a right. Here, they found no violation of a right, so they reached the substantive legal issue and said:  We're not going to waive. You don't find any case in Oklahoma law  --and your adversary, Mr. Waxman, can tell me -- where they found a constitutional violation either under state or federal law and said:  We won't accept a PCPA waiver. Can't find it because it doesn't exist. So now we're on the federal issue, okay?  That's all I'm looking at. Was there a Napue?  Was there a Brady violation?  That's your argument, correct?"
477,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," So he concedes the basis of the Napue order  --violation here, didn't he?"
478,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," Right. Now, if he's changed his testimony now in unsworn materials, that's irrelevant to us here, and it's irrelevant to the finding the Oklahoma court made below, correct?"
479,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," All right. So now let's go to the substance of the issue that the Chief raised, which was:  Could he have found this earlier and does that make a difference to the Napue violation and the Brady violation?  I thought the essence of the Napue violation is:  Was there a falsehood?  Did the prosecutor know it was a falsehood?  Not whether the defendant knew it was a falsehood but whether the prosecutor has an obligation to correct it. Is that correct?"
480,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you, counsel. We'll -- we'll get back shortly through the se riatim questions. Justice Alito?"
481,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Sorry. All right. Well, Mr. Waxman, Justice Sotomayor has taken us through the whole case, so maybe there's not much left to discuss, but I did have a few questions. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals said in paragraph 24 of its opinion, ""Even if this claim overcomes procedural bar, the facts do not rise to the level of a Brady violation."" Why isn't that a quintessential clear statement under -- under Long?  Even if it does not overcome the procedural bar, then  --and it goes on, then to the federal issue?"
482,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Why -- why is that so? In paragraph 26, the -- the Oklahoma court goes through the two requirements under state law under 1089. The issue is one that could have been presented previously because the factual basis for the claim was ascertainable  through the exercise of reasonable diligence. And then it goes on to the  --to the innocence requirement. And the facts are not sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for the alleged error, no  reasonable fact finder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense or would have rendered the penalty of death."
483,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," But what does that show?  Yes, there's no dispute that they -- they held in the alternative that there was no federal constitutional violation, but there is the Oklahoma statute. It has two requirements. They -- they -- they go through the two requirements, and they say that they weren't satisfied, and -- and they say:  Even if it could overcome the procedural bar, it still would not provide a basis for -- for relief. I -- I don't see what's unclear or even ambiguous about that."
484,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," All right. Going on to another point, you rely very heavily on a note that says ""Lithium?  Dr. Trumpet?"". And you read a lot into that. And the Van Treese family's amicus brief provides a pretty compelling counter-reading of that. And -- and you want us to say, well, just pretend it doesn't exist and read those notes the way we think they should be read, those cryptic notes the way we think they should be read, because it's not the  -- the material that the Van Treese brief relies on is not in the record of the case. We shouldn't even remand for an exploration of this?"
485,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," -- I get your point. Your point is we shouldn't consider it because it's not in the record, right?  That's the short answer?"
486,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Let me -- let me go on to one other question because the time is limited. You read McCarty, a 2005 case where the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals accepted  the State's waiver of 1089, you rely on that, but there is no reasoning in McCarty. The court  simply said that in a footnote the State expressly waived any procedural bar. Do you -- do you read this for the proposition that the Oklahoma court must accept all 1089 waivers in future cases?"
487,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," So one departure in the application of a discretionary  -- if the -- in a discretionary rule, if the rule is applied in a discretion -- in -- in a -- in -- in a habeas petitioner-friendly way in one case, that's the end of the matter?"
488,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," Counselor, no matter how we get past this, we have to reach whether the court ruled correctly on the constitutional issue, correct?"
489,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," And everything that the Oklahoma courts have done, you said a hundred years of their history, party presentation, the fact that they've never had a case with a constitutional violation where they didn't accept the waiver, correct?"
490,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," So I go back to the  -- this is not AEDPA, correct?  Our review is not AEDPA?  Meaning --"
491,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," -- if they -- if they reach the -- if they reach the constitutional question and we de novo decide whether they got the law right, correct?"
492,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," So whatever they said their reasons or thinking was, we have to look at the record and decide whether the facts and law support your argument that there were Brady and Napue violations, correct?"
493,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," Now tell me succinctly why, even assuming their finding that they could have determined this issue earlier, Brady and Napue violations would have occurred?"
494,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," It doesn't matter what state law says about that. The question  is what does federal law say about it, correct?"
495,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor, All right?  So even  --is there a Napue or a Brady violation if they could have discovered this earlier?
496,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," All right?  Let's assume that. So adequacy and independence is not at issue. Under federal  -- and this had happened, and it was the first case before the court, and they come up and they say:  There was  a Napue violation, there's a Brady violation. And your other side comes up and says:  No, there wasn't, because you could have found this earlier."
497,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," So, from your colloquy with Justice Alito, it seems that there  is agreement that the court in this case applied the procedural bar, right?  I mean, at least you  -- it's in the alternative, but they did actually apply the bar, is that right?"
498,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," All right. So even with respect to Brady, I guess -- doesn't that seem to be the problem, though, from the standpoint of AISG when the bar has been clearly waived?  I think that was Justice Sotomayor's initial point. Can parties in Oklahoma waive non-jurisdictional procedural bars?"
499,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," And  --and -- and what happens when those waivers occur?  I mean, do  -- do the Oklahoma courts routinely proceed to either evaluate the reasons for the waiver or reject it and continue on anyway?  I thought they just accepted  --if a party says, this is a non-jurisdictional bar, I have a right to raise it, but I'm waiving that  right, the Oklahoma court's standard practice, just like most courts, if not all courts, is to accept that and go on, right?"
500,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," As a matter of practice. So we don't need a rule necessarily that Oklahoma always accepts these. They just do it. I mean, that's what  -- we don't have any evidence that they've ever rejected it, correct, the waiver?"
501,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," Mr. Clement, back to the prosecutors. If you had -- if they were using a note of yours from 20 years ago, wouldn't you expect them to call you and have an in-depth investigation as to what your note meant?"
502,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," Well, when I looked at the note of Ms. Smothermon, I couldn't make heads or tails of it. It had a few names. It had ""lithium"" and a question mark. And she explains what it was. And according to her explanation, if it's true, it was simply about a conversation that Glossip's lawyer had with -- was it Sneed?"
503,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," I think her point was simply, I mean, even that sheet  --is that the sheet that she says the sheriff filled out? That it didn't come from  --actually from a doctor?"
504,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson, But are you saying that we are  -- that --that the question of Brady and Napue or a Napue violation is resolved because the attorney general has reached that conclusion?
505,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," All right. So why wouldn't we send it back?  I mean, it's my understanding -- if we send it back for an evidentiary hearing?  It's my understanding that  there's never been a court determination of any of these facts. Justice Thomas is saying there are some disputes about what the notes mean and whatnot. So I just  -- I guess I don't understand why we wouldn't, at the minimum, have some sort of requirement that a court make a  finding about these things?"
506,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," -- whether the prosecutor actually knew about it, knowledge is imputed to her, right?"
507,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," I think, under  -- under the law, anything in the prosecutor's possession, which includes prison records, is -- the knowledge is imputed to the prosecutor, correct?"
508,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," Can I ask you, Mr. Clement, about some of the questions that Justice Alito was asking Mr. Waxman about, the whether there is an independent and adequate state ground here, and -- and -- and really focus on these couple of pages of the Oklahoma court's opinion, which I find difficult to say the least, and ask you what you make of them?"
509,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," When you say ""the waiver issue,"" what do you mean by that?"
510,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," And suppose we want to go beyond that because it is true that we rarely say that there's no adequacy because this -- this is so out of the ordinary. It  -- it's a very rare kind of thing for us to say. And if we want to just look at  -- at what the Oklahoma court did in terms of justifying its denial of the confession of error and its determination to proceed, how  --what do you  -- how do you describe what they did?"
511,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," And then you get, like  --that's all the way down, right, until the last sentence, which is the ""Moreover"" sentence, and the ""Moreover"" sentence might suggest, again, a reference to the procedural bar. Is that -- is that true?"
512,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," At the most, what you have here in these two paragraphs is very significant discussions of the substance and then maybe a sentence about, oh, there's this procedural bar thing that we're doing too. Is that  --is that correct?"
513,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," And, you know, in a way, this actually relates to the first point that you made about how unusual it is to deny the State's request for a waiver here, because that's sort of what they start with. They say they have these two claims and the State has come forward and said this warrants post-conviction relief, and we're not accepting that because the State -- the State's concession is not based in law or fact. What --what do you take that to mean?"
514,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," I mean, the State has only come forward with Napue arguments and Brady arguments, is that right?  So they must be saying we're not -- we're not going with the State because we don't agree with their views of Napue and Brady, as we're going to now explain."
515,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," Of interwoven; therefore, you know, not independent?"
516,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," -- is it possible that -- is it possible that, you know, they know that they're doing something very unusual here, which  is rejecting the State's request for a waiver, and they're just throwing everything in the kitchen sink in?  They're saying, you know, we don't see the merits of these claims, either the Brady claim or the Napue claim. They're saying there's this procedural bar statute hanging around and we kind of think that that's been violated too. And we actually don't know, like, if you took this piece out, if you took that piece out, how they would have come out."
517,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Mr. Clement, whether a procedural bar must  -- whether the waiver of a procedural bar must be accepted by the Oklahoma court is a question of Oklahoma law, right?  The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals can say:  We always accept these, we never  accept them, or sometimes we accept them, right?"
518,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," And you have exactly one case, McCarty, for the proposition that this must  --this waiver must be accepted. Exactly one. Have -- can you cite one other case where we've deemed a state decision inadequate for conflicting with one prior opinion?  I thought our decision said that there's inadequacy when they conflict with many  --with many ""past unambiguous holdings."""
519,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further?"
520,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," Just one point with respect to the transport order. I think my concern is that in their letter, the prosecutors say they did not see the transport order until 2022. So my problem is, if they don't  --if they never saw it, then how is there a Brady or Napue violation?"
521,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," But wouldn't it matter that  --whether or not they have it?  I mean, you're  --again, I go back to the prosecutors. You're  --what I'm hearing  is, and they're hearing, is that they did not turn over Brady material or that they permitted false testimony to take place, and they're saying: Look, it did not happen. And why wouldn't they be interviewed? Why don't we have materials from them other than in an amicus brief in this case?"
522,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas, So -- so what are we to do with the point that they make that they were frozen out of the process?
523,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," At least one of the two prosecutors was interviewed in some way because we have an affidavit from him that was provided before the OCCA while this case was pending, correct?"
524,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," -- so I -- I -- I'm having a hard time understanding what the current claim by both of them is:  We weren't  able to give our full story. They had  -- they were interviewed, correct?"
525,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor, But there were  -- it  -- it wasn't as if they were boxed out?
526,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," Can I go back to your respectful consideration to an attorney general's confession of error, and Justice Jackson asked you whether the Court has to accept the confession of error, and you said no. And I think that's correct. The Court, as I understand the rule of confession of error, it's especially relevant to questions of fact, correct?"
527,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," Not questions of law?  The court has to be satisfied that there's  a basis in law and fact for the confession, correct?"
528,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," And your view is that the result likely would have been different, right?"
529,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," And what -- can you spell that out?  I mean, I think it's obvious, but  --but spell out why you think that."
530,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," -- that you have? I mean, otherwise, it's party presentation for a long time but not zeroing in on the procedural bar at issue here?  I just want to be sure I understand. I'm not trying to be hostile."
531,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," -- right?  And in the fourth, they also refused to accept the confession of error and the waiver, right?"
532,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," So, when the fifth came up, it wasn't as -- as much of a surprise, right?  I mean, why wasn't the attorney general  ready at that point to say, you know, but you -- there's McCarty and you can't -- you can't reject our waiver?"
533,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," Okay. I want to ask you about the standard of review for looking at Smothermon's notes because one of the difficulties, I think, with the notes is that, putting aside whether the Van Treese brief is in the record, it's not, it still -- it still reveals that there are multiple plausible interpretations of the notes. So are we supposed to be applying kind of a preponderance standard, that we think it's most likely that they reflect that she knew about the psychiatric examination?"
534,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," So just going back to Justice Barrett's question about whether McCarty is your only case, if I'm hearing you correctly, it is not because the principle that you're relying on is the fact that it is firmly established in Oklahoma law and procedure that non-jurisdictional procedural bars are waiveable and the courts accept those waivers. They do it when a party waives a non-procedural jurisdictional bar. So it's pretty much every case in which a non-jurisdictional procedural bar has been offered and accepted by the court, right?"
535,2024.22-7466-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," I think that part of the problem here that is what is confusing about Oklahoma's opinion is that they seem to be conflating which I  -- what I think are two different bases for not applying the procedural bar, right?  One is the waiver, and the other is potentially the confession of error. In your discussion with Justice Barrett, it's -- you talked a little bit about  Glossip IV. And in my reading of that, that was a situation in which there was a waiver expressly made, but I didn't know that there was  also a confession of error. Am I right about that in that?"
536,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, What do you make of the absence of statements by the prosecutors in this record and the absence of Ackley's not es from the same meeting?
537,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," -- a separate question, though, about just he lied on the stand?  And in a case where the entire case rested on the testimony of one person and his credibility, if you can show that he lied on the stand when he said ""I never saw a psychiatrist and I didn't get a prescription from the psychiatrist, it was, you know, they gave me lithium for a common cold,"" and  --and then the prosecutor says:  Well, that was a lie, I better correct that under Napue and  --and doesn't, that seems pretty material to me. I mean, it's just your one witness has been exposed as a liar."
538,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," False is false. You know, like, whether you can, like, parse the content of the testimony this way or that way, the critical question that a jury is asking is, do I believe this guy and everything he says and particularly, do I believe him when he points the finger at the accused?  And if I know that he has gotten up to the stand and lied about anything, whether it's important or not -- it might have been important; it might not have been important -- if he's lying, if he's trying to cover up something about his own behavior, I'm going to take that into account in deciding whether, when he accuses the defendant, he's telling the truth."
539,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," I have to say I find that an  --an odd argument, Mr. Michel. It's like this witness was so not credible anyway that we don't have to consider any further lies that he tells?"
540,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," What do we do with the other violations that the prosecutor committed?  Presumably, he lied about the knife incident, which was provoked by the prosecutor and not his initial statement. There was withheld --a ton of other withheld information. Once you find a violation and you're deciding on materiality, are you entitled to ignore all that other evidence having been improperly withheld? I know that it was in Glossip IV and -- and prior rulings the court didn't find any one of those a violation, but do we ignore it? Meaning because we're -- we would be looking at  this issue de novo, so does the calculus of materiality take into account everything?"
541,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," -- revive, but let's get to the end, that we accept what Justice Kagan has said, that there was a falsehood. And now you're saying there was, even if she knew about it, it wasn't material. At that point, because, according to you, he lied outside of court a number of times, but does all the other withheld evidence that shows not just one or two lies but a whole body  of changed testimony, do we consider that?"
542,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Mr. Michel, I do want to ask you about the adequate and independent state grounds because this is unusual, not to accept, you know, the waiver of the procedural bar and, you know, you heard us talk about that with Mr. Clement and Mr. Waxman. What's your response to that?"
543,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," What about Mr. Clement's saying that we have a hundred years of practice and that this is just what the law is, and procedural bars are always waivable; they are not jurisdictional?"
544,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But why is that? Why are you making the sample size so small?  I mean, I understand that's the only case that involves an attorney general who expressly waives a procedural bar, but procedural bars are waived -- of all kinds are waived all the time. So why wouldn't what Oklahoma courts do when a procedural bar is waived, why wouldn't that be the universe of cases that we're looking at?"
545,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson, Are you saying that statute is a jurisdictional one?
546,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," All right. So then we're into the world of non-jurisdictional procedural bars, and the question is what is Oklahoma's practice when a party, it doesn't have to be the attorney general, it can be a party, who could have invoked a non-jurisdictional procedural bar, what does the court do?"
547,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson, -- in which the Court has rejected any non -jurisdictional procedural bar?
548,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Well, I'm just wondering what the right sample size is. When we're asking this question about whether this is adequate or not, should we be looking transsubstantively or should we be looking just at this statute?"
549,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson, But the thing that's relevant about this statute is whether or not it's jurisdictional. I don't understand how the sample size could possibly be that small because the question we're asking is whether it's waivable. Right?  So I -- I understand we have a statute and the question is what does a court do when this procedural bar is waived?  Fine. But do you  -- are you rejecting the proposition that this is a waivable bar?
550,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But assuming that he did, for a moment, do you have any other procedural bar ever that Oklahoma has rejected? Do we have any reason to believe that Oklahoma's  practice is to look at particular statutes and it rejects some waivers with respect to certain statutes and it accepts some?  No, right?"
551,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," So the way I -- this is very confusing, two pages, to me. I've read it a dozen times and I'm still not sure what each paragraph is doing exactly, you know, what or where or why. But the first thing they say is, you know, the State has come to us and has confessed error and we're not going to accept that concession, is what they call it. And the concession that they're referring to is the concession that he warrants post-conviction relief, right?  And what the state has said in its application  -- in its, you know, concession as they call it, is -- focuses on Napue and why it is that Napue supports Glossip here. And -- and it says the state's concession is not based in law or fact. And  -- and that's what gets it to everything else that it does, right?  Because, first, it has to reject the concession, and it says not based on law and fact. Essentially meaning that the state's Napue argument is wrong. So before it gets to anything that might be conceived of as a procedural bar, what it has said  is that the State's Napue argument is wrong. Correct?"
552,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," -- is you would never get to paragraph 26, except for the prior determination that the State  -- that the State's concession is wrong, which has to be a determination on the merits. Even if that's not the case  --let's say that I've just made it a little bit too neat, that you have to have that the State is wrong with the merits in order to go into the procedural bar analysis. Even if that's too neat, I mean, like, there are sentences in this opinion  -- one --one sentence we're talking about the merits, one sentence we're talking about the procedural bar. It keeps on going back and forth. I mean, how -- how on earth could one reach a conclusion that the  -- that the court would have done exactly what the court did if the court had a different view of the merits?  I mean, everything was intertwined with everything else here."
553,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Well, paragraph 26 is, number one, one paragraph of six or seven, right?  So  -- so I don't think that you get to just say:  This is my best paragraph. You have to look at the analysis and say:  Is it intertwined or is it independent?  And, you know, all paragraph 26 does is to state a standard. It's like, okay, we know that they thought that this standard had something to do with something, but the rest of the two pages is, like, totally merits-infused."
554,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Not in the alternative. He doesn't say ""and in the alternative,"" right?  He -- he -- he doesn't say:  I'm invoking the procedural bar, but if you, you know, somehow think it's overcome, let me go on, right?"
555,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Does he also say: I'm incorporating my arguments from Glossip IV, where he expressly waived?"
556,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," No, no, no. It  -- I'm asking you, isn't it evidence that he expressly intended to waive?"
557,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito? Justice Sotomayor? Justice Kagan? Justice Kavanaugh?"
558,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Yeah. I think you had said earlier and I want to explore, if you get past all the procedural bars and you get to the point where the prosecutors didn't comply with their obligations, that it still wouldn't have made a difference to the jury had they known that Sneed was bipolar and that he had  lied on the stand. And I'm having some trouble on that last piece of the argument, if we get there, understanding that, when the whole case depended on his credibility. Can you explain that some more?"
559,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Would have made the conviction more likely if the jury knows that not only does he have an incentive to lie, that he's lied on the stand and that he's bipolar, therefore, creating all sorts of avenues for questioning his credibility?"
560,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," It seems like there's some pretty significant factual questions that have been debated. You know, what did counsel know?  What do these notes, markings mean?  Was Sneed's statement that he never saw a psychiatrist true or false?  Would you object to an evidentiary hearing?  As I understood it, no court has ever actually made findings on those things."
561,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson, -- that it's necessary?  You say we can look at it and  --
562,2024.22-7466-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," If we disagree with that, if we're getting to the merits, what -- how  -- how should we go about deciding whether there was a Brady or Napue violation here?"
563,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," In Phase  -- in --in -- in your permit, Phase I, doesn't that contain a narrative limitation?"
564,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," -- with this permit, what is at bottom the problem?"
565,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson, Are the water quality standards in state law?  I  -- I thought that the EPA permits were just incorporating obligations that already existed in state law. Am I wrong about that?
566,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson, So California has established certain water quality standards. Are those independently binding on the cities and municipalities in California?
567,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson, Do they  -- do you have to have permits under state law so that they get bound  --you get bound through the state permitting process then?
568,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Let's talk about the statute. Like, what in the statute prevents the agency from saying, in addition to or instead of the highly prescriptive, you know, you can only discharge X amount, we want to set a goal, and we want to tell you that you're obligated to not contribute to violating that goal?"
569,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," See, to me, this regulation -- what does this regulation do?  It says go meet and implement the water quality standards, because you were exactly right in what you said to Justice Jackson, as without this regulation, or not this regulation but this condition in the permit, you're not independently obligated to -- they're not enforced  --those standards are not enforceable against you. It's the permit condition that makes those standards enforceable against you by the EPA. So that's what this condition does. It -- it  -- it  -- it's  -- it's prescribing that you have to meet water quality standards. Like, how more clearly could you meet this statutory language than that?"
570,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor, How can they do that?  They can't go to court unless there's a permit violation.
571,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," But we have to go to that extreme. So how do we get San Francisco to do something about its implementing -- its monitoring obligations?  It's supposed to monitor and look at things and, if things are getting out of control, figure out how to put them back into control."
572,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," -- in this permit, this is not a permit involving entities -- multiple entities that are discharging into most of these waters. So most of these water, it's one permitholder, the City of San Francisco. It's combining sewage and rainwater runoff, correct, so it knows all of the point sources that contribute to that water quality  have effluent limitations because you can test those and see whether they're meeting standards. So, if something unexpected happens, it's because one of those water sources has gone awry, correct?"
573,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," Oh, so they should take each -- I see in the water standards  they're very detailed on any number of -- of discharges. You can only have X amount of feces  in the water, X amount -- or Y amount of bacteria. Pages and pages of measurements. You want them to write all of those  -- take the water standards, and instead of cross-referencing them and telling you to meet those standards, you want them to write each amount?"
574,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," Well, that -- that's the point I'm making. It does that. Where there's -- where they're exceeding the limitation, it tells it what technology to put into place to reduce it. But, if they're not exceeding it right now, how do they take care of the -- the unexpected situations?"
575,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Yeah, can I just piggyback on that if you'll -- if you'll let me, Justice Sotomayor?"
576,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," And I thought the statutory hook that you were relying on in (b)(1)(C), 301(b)(1)(C), was the phrase ""any more stringent limitation necessary to meet water quality standards.""  And you read ""an y more stringent limitation"" to refer back and mean effluent limitation. Is that your statutory hook?"
577,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Absolutely. 301(a) sets effluent limitations, and then, when it says ""any more stringent limitation,"" you say the fact that the word ""effluent"" is not there is  -- in context, it's obviously referring to ""effluent limitations"" and then ""meet water quality standards,"" right?"
578,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," First of all, it wasn't raised before the Ninth Circuit. It was  mentioned in the dissent, but, when you filed for certiorari, you didn't make this argument. And you now raise it -- I was quite surprised when I read the question presented and started your brief and thought to myself this is a new theory. How is that argument not forfeited?"
579,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor, Just answer my question. Why didn't you forfeit this argument?
580,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor, And how did you not forfeit it in the court below by not raising it?
581,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," On the ""more stringent"" area -- question, if it's a different limitation, it's more stringent, isn't it?  Meaning you're defining ""more stringent"" as being more hardship on me than the effluent limitation. But doesn't that answer Justice  Kagan's point, which is anytime you have another obligation, it's more stringent?"
582,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," I'm not sure I understand that. I mean, these do impose obligations on you above and beyond what the technology -based limits do, isn't that right? You have to do more?"
583,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Well, for example, suppose a technology-based condition says, you know, don't discharge more than 75 gallons of sewage. And now, in addition to that, a water  quality-based condition says don't cause or contribute to meaningful discoloration. Isn't it more stringent than the first condition standing alone because, on a particular day, you might have to cut your discharges more to 60 gallons of -- per day?"
584,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But isn't that the point?  I mean, do  -- do you dispute that Congress was attempting to have a backstop with respect to requiring or allowing for any more stringent limitation?  I mean, the word ""any"" in here also, it seems to me, does work to suggest that we don't have to stay within the world of effluent limitations. So how do you account for that? And isn't the point of having this that Congress understood that the (1)(A) effluent limitations might not be sufficient, so the authority was given to prescribe any more stringent limitation?"
585,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Well, what is it doing?  I mean, we already have  a provision that allows for or authorizes effluent limitations. And then we get to this one that says you can put in a permit any more stringent limitation. And  -- and speaking of reading out the words, it says ""including those necessary.""  So it's not even clear that ""those necessary"" is the sum total of the limitations. It says ""any more stringent limitations.""  So isn't -- doesn't that just on its textual reading suggest we're beyond the effluent limitations that were previously authorized?"
586,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," I understand  that point, but what -- what do we do with the fact that Congress chose, I think, to codify the EPA's interpretation of this  --of this -- the CSO control policy, and that policy, it's my understanding, explicitly endorsed the kind of  permit provisions at issue here, those that regulate sewage treatment that incorporate water  quality standards beyond effluent limitations?  Is -- do you -- do you dispute that Congress endorsed the kinds of permit provisions that exist here?"
587,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further?"
588,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," Are there  -- not in your case, but are there any provisions -- is there any prohibition in 1311 against  E -- EPA having the generic limitations in a -- in a plan for someone else?  Just generically, not you."
589,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, Yeah. Are they precluded from having generic limitations?
590,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," Well, let me ask: Can EPA impose generic limitations on anyone?"
591,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, So would you have a -- an arbitrary-and-capricious claim if you did not bring this as a statutory claim?
592,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," The government says that there are no other significant point or non-point sources of pollution around the Southwest Ocean Outfall. Assuming for the sake of argument that that is true  --I heard you to dispute it earlier in your argument  --but assuming for the sake of argument that it is true, why couldn't you then figure out what is necessary for you to do to comply with the water quality standards?"
593,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor, And you haven't told me what you do with unanticipated discharges. You ignore them until the permit is amended?  Is that your answer?
594,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," -- what you told me earlier not to do:  come in and tell you, using the technology you're using now, ensure yourself that you're not doing more than X amount of feces in the water?  Would that be  an okay limitation?"
595,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," If I understood your response to Justice Thomas, Justice Thomas said: What prevents the EPA from doing this?  You said:  1311(b)(1)(C) doesn't authorize it because this is not an effluent limitation. But, of course, (1)(C) does not talk about effluent limitations. (1)(C) just talks about limitations. (1)(A) talks about effluent limitations. (1)(B) talks about effluent limitations. You were adding a word to (1)(C) to get effluent limitations there, weren't you?"
596,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," Ms. Steeley, as I understand your argument  --I just want to make sure I understand it  --there are -- there are two arguments. One is that (b)(1)(C) should be read to regard effluent limitations. That's your primary argument. I had thought in the briefs that there was a backup argument that, nonetheless, whatever it has to be, it has to be a limitation  on your discharges given that that's what 1311(a) is all about, the discharge of any pollutant by a person, except -- except as specified here, is unlawful and that whatever  the limitation is, it can't be the applicable water quality standard itself because that -- that is used in contradistinction with limitations throughout this statute. Is that -- is that correct?"
597,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," A few questions. Just to pick up on Justice Thomas's question when he asked if anything prohibits, your response  --and I just want to make sure I have this clear -- was nothing in the statute authorizes something like the generic limitations, correct?"
598,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," And that -- and your point about water quality standards, I want to make sure, I think with Justice Gorsuch, the water quality standards are the goal or the end, that the statutory means to that end that are authorized by the statute are the effluent limitations?"
599,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," And when you say narrative effluent limitations, I think Footnote 22 of your brief talks about that and you've mentioned it at oral argument. Can you --and Justice Sotomayor picked up on that. Can you just describe briefly what you mean there?"
600,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," And then the practical way this works, to pick up on Justice Alito and Justice Sotomayor's questions, let's say there are 10 different entities discharging at a particular source. If the water quality is not good in that area, EPA can go back to one or more of the 10 and tighten up the effluent limitations in the permits, which may take some time, as Justice Sotomayor points out, and you quibble with that, but, in any event, that's the means for EPA to do this, right?"
601,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh, What are -- what are you on the hook for?  There's an EPA suit against you. What is the amount San Francisco is on the hook for for something they didn't know they needed to do?  At least that's your claim. What's the amount?
602,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson, So I understand that you say that the issue here is whether the Generic Prohibitions are authorized by law. Is that right?
603,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," And that's the core of your argument, and that you say that Congress did not contemplate this, having this general prohibition  -- Generic Prohibition. But I guess I can't square that with 33-1342(q)(1), which is the 2000 amendment in which Congress  appears to be saying that each permit for a discharge ""shall conform to the Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy"" signed by the agency. And then,  when you look at the control sewer overflow control policy -- or the Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy, that policy, I think, the longstanding policy of the agency, was to include these generic kinds of -- what you call generic kinds of limitations. I mean, it's very explicit in the policy. It says the authority should at least require permittees to comply with the applicable water quality standards. And, apparently, EPA had guidance that said it didn't matter whether this was Phase I or Phase II; these kinds of permitting conditions we're going to put in our permits. So how can it be, given the amendment here, that Congress did not intend for these kinds of provisions to exist in permits?"
604,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," -- was it EPA's guidance and weren't they saying this is what you have to do pursuant to our policy?  It would -- EPA has never taken the position, I think, that their own policy did not require these."
605,2024.23-753-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson, One final thing. Did  you -- did you waive an arbitrary-and- capricious claim?  I know Justice Thomas was talking about -- with you about having an arbitrary-and-capricious claim. But I thought you ha d waived that.
606,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," Mr. Liu, do -- do you agree that 1311 seems to focus primarily on  effluents and discharge?"
607,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," Okay. Now that provision, (C), talks about limitations, including those necessary to meet water quality standards, and it also talks  --mentions ""or required to implement any applicable water quality standard.""  How exactly does the generic limitation do that?"
608,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," The  -- I don't understand -- you know, the bad old days is when we had water quality standards, right, people didn't know what they were supposed to do, how it was going to be allocated, sort of a problem with the  --the comments, and they put in the permit system. And I think the danger here is that you're going back to the other system because it, one, gives more power to you because you don't have to tell the people who are discharging what they have to do or not, you can sit back, and then  -- and also you don't even have to allocate among many different polluters who's responsible for -- for what. So what prevents you -- I know you touched on a couple of things in response to Justice Thomas, but I'm not sure that was significant limitations from saying, as you're doing here, we're going to go with water quality standards because that's maybe harder for the people with effluent, but it's a lot easier for us?"
609,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," What do you do with multiple people discharging effluent and you have a water quality standard?  There are eight different industries, 10 different water districts, whatever. They're all doing it. And you look at the water quality and you say  there's too much of this."
610,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," How do you allocate who's -- this was the problem that led to the permit system. I mean, how  do you allocate responsibility for that?"
611,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Well, how would an as-applied challenge work in that case? Somebody's supposed to come and say:  Well, you put this much on me. I think you should put different amounts on those other three because I think they're doing more or they can afford more or they are  -- they have more modern plants. And you're just going to go back and say:  Well, this is how we -- we want to allocate?"
612,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," But the problem is you can go after an individual entity like the City of San Francisco based on the past, when they didn't know what the relevant limitation on them was, and seek retroactively, without fair notice, huge penalties, including criminal punishment, based on something that was -- they didn't know what they could discharge or not discharge, correct?"
613,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," May I ask, Mr. Liu, is this a multiple discharge situation?  There seems to be some conflict between the government's position and San Francisco's position on that. As I understood Ms. Steeley, she said that's true of one, what you say, but it's not true of all eight. What's the situation there?"
614,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," I see. And if -- this issue of, like, we  don't know what we're supposed to do, it's horribly unfair, and  -- and you think, well, they've really not come up with any particular way in which that's true, I mean, I thought that most of these were something like this:  There's a California water quality standard that says waters shall not contain floating material in concentrations that adversely affect fishing and swimming. And it turns out EPA says that, notwithstanding that standard, San Francisco has left lots of toilet paper floating in Mission Creek. I mean, that's not a ""we don't know what  to do"" issue. Like, we know you're not supposed to leave toilet paper floating in Mission Creek, don't we?"
615,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," -- we should -- so we could limit the decision to items like that, but in terms of particular concentrations  of chemicals that you cannot see floating in the water, we would have  --we could reserve that decision because that interferes with the permit system in a way that the others may not?"
616,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," -- or that they're not on notice, but if they were, you would be vulnerable to an arbitrary -and -capricious challenge?"
617,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," How common are these permits?  These ones that are more generic, narrative form, and they're getting at  non-effluent limitations."
618,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," -- Mr. Liu, you said at one point that you lacked the information necessary to provide a more specific provision than the provisions that are in question here. But is there anything that prevented you from obtaining whatever information you thought you needed?"
619,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," And do you have  --do -- when a regulated party doesn't provide the information that you think you need, do you lack tools to require that to be done?"
620,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", -- do you want us to hold  --and maybe this would be an appropriate disposition of this case  --that permit requirements like these are required  -- are permitted in the specific situation in which EPA or the state has made every reasonable effort to get the necessary information from the regulated party and the regulated party has refused to provide the information?
621,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," In that limited situation, you can resort to this sort of permit condition?"
622,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Mr. Liu, can I invite you to go back to the text and comment on the statutory interpretation question, which is what I understood counsel on the other side to say this all reduces to whether or not the statute authorizes these kinds of generic limitations?  Her argument -- I mean, the -- the way I'm looking at the statute, we have (A) talking about the discharge being unlawful and (B) talking about the objectives. (b)(1)(A) is specific to effluent limitations, and then there are some subsections about those. And then (C) says ""any more stringent limitation, including those necessary,"" et cetera. So, on its face, it looks like ""any more stringent limitations"" is taking us outside of effluent limitations because the ""more"" is relevant to something or relative to something. But she suggests that (a)(1) is setting effluent limitations with the best practicable control technology requirement, and the ""any more stringent limitations"" is limited to allow  --well, is allowing for effluent limitations that go beyond best control. Do you understand what I'm saying? She suggests that it's still cabined by ""effluent limitations."""
623,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," And I guess I'm wondering what we do with ""any more stringent limitation.""  Doesn't that defeat her argument? Or how does the government respond to that point?"
624,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," For sure. For sure. I get that. But -- but, when you just say go forth and do good, okay, right, and  -- and -- and  -- or, you know, do not create a nuisance, or, you know, don't  -- what is it?  One of them is  -- do not cause aesthetically undesirable dislocation  -- discoloration of the ocean, that's our water quality standard. And you put that  --is that a limitation on what they do, on what they discharge, in any meaningful sense, or is that the water quality standard  itself?"
625,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," If that's the case, then I -- I guess I -- I'm kind of circling back  to the Chief Justice's question and, really, maybe administrative agencies generally. The point was to  --to -- to  --to give people notice ex ante of their legal obligations rathe r than rely on tort ex post, nuisance law. What -- what -- what value added is there to just an ex post tort nuisance law regime when you say:  Don't  --don't create a nuisance?"
626,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," No, I understand that. But  -- but --but does it add anything to an ex post tort nuisance regime?"
627,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," No, I'm just asking as a practical matter, if -- if --if --if we're essentially saying don't create a nuisance and EPA sets the standard as opposed to an expert witness, what  --what value has been added?"
628,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," -- that even begs the question further, right?  If -- if this is just a circle, the state standard is the state standard. That would be set in nuisance law too. And so what  -- what --what --"
629,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Because then you're going to have an administrative agency ex ante create limitations on what you can do as a permittee in order to make sure that those water quality standards were met. But, if you take that away and there's no ex ante limitation anymore on what you can do, aren't we just sort of back to a state law nuisance regime in which the state's setting the standard of care?"
630,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," That would be  -- that would be pretty good evidence of the duty in a nuisance suit, wouldn't it, the duty of care?"
631,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch, You don't think Congress wanted to  -- to ensure advance notice to permittees of their obligations under the law?
632,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch, That wasn't part of the purposes?  You  --you just --
633,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," No, that's not my  -- Mr. Liu, my question was:  Was part of what Congress was trying to do is, as the Chief Justice indicated, try to provide some certainty on ex ante rather than just adjudicating all this ex post in nuisance cases?"
634,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Well, Justice Gorsuch's question was, I think, and the Chief Justice's, combining the water quality standards and the effluent limitations. And part of what  we have to do is figure out how they fit together in 30 -- 301 there, (b)(1)(C). And it strikes me that the way Congress ensured both more effectiveness and fair notice was to say that the end is water quality standards  --things like this, discoloration of fish, marine communities, et cetera -- but the means to the end were effluent limitations, which would both be, as the Chief Justice said, more effective, and, as Justice Gorsuch said, fair notice. And if they're not tight enough, EPA has mechanisms to tighten them up. What's wrong with that reading of the two things together?"
635,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," How does that hurt EPA, if you want to say that -- if  you want to respond to that?  How does that harm EPA's ability to regulate if they have to do it that way?"
636,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?"
637,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", To what -- do we know to what degree the problem with the water quality in the affected body of water is the result of water that the City is intentionally  discharging and to what degree it is the result of these sewer overflows?
638,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," Mr. Liu, maybe I need to start from the beginning. When you're obligated to give effluent limitations, could you give a permit that says just meet water quality controls?"
639,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor, -- for its combined rainwater and -- or stormwater and  sewerage systems. So it's individual in that sense. What does that mean as opposed to a general permit?
640,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," Those protocols generally produce X amount or Y amount of pollutant or effluents, and we're saying you can do that, but only if you're going to go over those set limits are we going to require you to  step in and do something else, correct?"
641,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," That's what  -- that's what happens with a general permit. Now this individual permit, there was a  -- there was a concern by Justice -- the Chief Justice that this individual permit, they have many point sources of the sewerage coming in. I mean, everybody's bathroom is a point source. And they have -- yeah, that's what sewerage is, isn't it?  It's what goes into the sewer waters, okay?  And that unless they know -- unless they have effluent limitations, they won't know how to control those individual point sources or figure out how to control who's the bad actor here, what neighborhood's the bad actor. Does that matter in a situation like this?"
642,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor, So your effluent limitations are already telling it control all these things that we know you can control and control them in this way because there's better technology you could put in?
643,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor, Now what you're saying with respect to the other water standards that you're incorporating by reference is we can't tell that because  -- whatever reasons?
644,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan, -- what would you do instead and who would suffer from that?
645,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," And one last question is:  How long have you been doing this for, in  either the individualized context or the general context?  You know, when did this start?  Is  this a consistent practice that EPA has developed?"
646,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," I have a few questions. You just referenced farmers would be helped by -- the Farm Bureau Federation's in here representing 6 million farm families, along with an amicus brief that represents, as they say, nearly ever business sector across the U.S. economy. They're not happy with just leaving it up to you to represent their interests, frankly, and they say that your position will make it impossible for many permittees to protect themselves from unanticipated liability. They say that their members, including the Farm Bureau Federation, those farmers, and other permittees are left exposed to the potentially devastating and unnecessarily costly  consequences of a government enforcement action or citizen suit. So they're not  --they're not happy with ""trust us.""  Do you want to respond to the Farm  Bureau Federation argument?"
647,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Presumably, they're aware of that and filed the amicus brief with that in mind, but, in any event, on to the next one. On the -- what you said to Justice Alito about what the opinion could say, and you said when we should avoid relying on these, when we can avoid relying on these. Would you be okay with an opinion that said we must avoid  relying on these when we can avoid relying on them?"
648,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," On the criminal penalties point that Justice Barrett raised and you said that hadn't been pursued, but,  obviously, civil and citizen suits are pursued. And how much are you seeking from San Francisco?"
649,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," Just a quick follow -up to that. I think, when I asked you that question about criminal penalties, you cabined your answer to municipalities. Have you pursued them in the context, in this general permitting context, you know, on farmers or small businesses?"
650,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett, Is that why you cabined your answer to municipalities?
651,2024.23-753-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Right. So we don't have congressional findings, for example, that the statute needs to be interpreted consistent with an understanding of what would be most fair  to the polluters who are putting the sewage into the water, is that correct?"
652,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, You mentioned Section 1367. Could you spend a few minutes on your argument as to how it disposes of -- supports your argument?
653,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," So do you think, Ms. Wellington, that  --let's say this wasn't a removal case. Let's say this was an original case and it was brought in federal court, and then the plaintiff took out the federal claim, leaving only state claims. Is there supplemental jurisdiction there?"
654,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," So forgetting what the reason for that is, you do agree with that rule that once I file a suit in federal court as an original matter, then take out the federal claims, leaving only state law claims, there's nothing at that point for the federal court to do?  It's not a doctrine of discretion anymore. The federal court has to dismiss. Is that correct?"
655,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," That's the point, isn't it?  I -- I can't get over the fact that what Congress did in 1367 was address the questions that had been in the Court. The first one was the diversity issue under St. Paul, and it agreed with the Court. It disagreed with the Court on pendent and supplemental jurisdiction, and it wrote a statute to address that. And yet it knew from Cahill that we had said that if a plaintiff dismisses an action, that potentially we go back to the original amendment, and it didn't do what it did for diversity. It wrote  it to say only when the district court dismisses the federal claims do you retain supplemental jurisdiction. That, to me, is the statute. They had all our case law. They addressed one -- one thing they agreed with. They disagreed with  another, and they disagreed with the third by not adopting what it did with diversity."
656,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," And when the district court dismisses all federal claims, the party still has a right to appeal, correct?"
657,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," When the district court doesn't do that in a diverse action, then that  --because the claim has disappeared, there's no appeal for the defendant  --for the -- for -- for anybody, correct?"
658,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Can I just understand your argument about whether or not an amendment can affect federal question jurisdiction?  So setting aside diversity for a second, we're in federal question land. The case is filed in federal court. And the plaintiff goes through the first couple weeks and then says:  You know what?  I'm dropping my federal claims, because it originally brought  a complaint that had federal and state claims. Does that affect jurisdiction in your view or not?"
659,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," -- originally brought in federal court. And the plaintiff amends and takes out the federal claims. Can the court proceed, can it decide through supplemental jurisdiction or whatnot to continue on with the case?"
660,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Okay. So next question. You  --the case is brought in state court and it has federal and state claims, and before the defendant has the ability to remove, the plaintiff says:  Oops, I didn't mean to bring the federal claims, I'm dropping them. So no removal action yet or motion yet. Can it be still removed?  Is there any basis for federal jurisdiction in that situation?"
661,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," All right. So it seems to me then your argument comes down to the impact of removal because somehow, even though  in a situation in which the plaintiff amends, if it was brought originally in federal court or amends if it's brought originally in st ate court, those have an impact, you say, on federal question jurisdiction. Somehow, if the defendant removes before the plaintiff can drop the federal claims, you say no impact on federal question jurisdiction. Is that right?"
662,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," On removal. But I guess why -- why does it make a difference as to how this case landed in federal court as to whether or not the federal judge can be divested of his jurisdiction?  That's what your argument seems to turn on, and I don't know why that's the case."
663,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," It changes the scope of jurisdiction. The  --the removal right carries with it the ability to affect the jurisdiction of the Court, is what you're saying?"
664,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Counsel, can I interrupt you there?  I mean, St. Paul Mercury is a little bit different because it's diversity. And there's always been a problem, you know, when I used to teach diversity jurisdiction, in the amount in controversy and figuring out how to value it. And you're not capped to the damages that you claim. And so there wasn't a real change there. And, you know, Cohill, okay, it's -- it's helpful, but it's really about a different point. It's about dismissal versus remand. I think the best thing for you are all these court of appeals cases. I mean, I  -- I have a lot of trouble with the textual argument for the reasons  Justice Kagan is saying, but, I mean, it does give me some pause to say, well, all these courts of appeals have thought this was okay and there is that footnote in Rockwell, but it's not quite the old soil principle because the old soil principle requires you to be able to hang your hat on something in the statute and say this is what brought along the old soil with it. So you cite Taggart and the old soil principle, but what are you attaching it to as opposed to just some sort of, like, free-floating, everyone thought we could do this?"
665,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Your  --your briefing, obviously, suggests at least at the outset you don't think Grable has much to do with this case. And your friend on the other side obviously disagrees. But I wonder why it -- it doesn't. I mean, your reading, I think, assumes the  correctness of your position under 1367 that this complaint is one over which the district court would have original jurisdiction. And your friend, I think, has concluded that depends upon whether Grable is  correct. And so why  --why isn't it -- why doesn't it depend upon Grable?"
666,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," In -- in 2007, in Rockwell, in Footnote 6, the statement there resolves this case in your favor, Footnote 6. Now the other side's going to say a lot of things about Footnote 6, I think, that it's dicta, that it's mistaken, that it's w rong, that it should be ditched. You want to just take on Footnote 6? Because you win with Footnote 6, but  --"
667,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," -- why -- okay, assuming  --why is it correct?  In other words, it does seem, as Justice Kagan's questions indicate, that the Rockwell above the line and the Rockwell footnote, you would think, would come out the same way under the text of the statute. So I guess, assuming the above-the-line part is correct, why does the text of the statute support Footnote 6?"
668,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Suppose a diversity case  --I have a diversity case, I file it in state court, it's removed to federal court, and once I'm in federal court, I join a non -diverse party. Can the federal  -- can the federal court hold onto that case?"
669,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Yeah. Well, why should there be a different rule regarding parties and claims?"
670,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," If we thought that the Eighth Circuit's decision is right as a matter of first principle, what relevance, if any, would this line of court of appeals decisions have in our decision-making?"
671,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Well, this goes back to a question that Justice Barrett asked. Usually, when we apply this old soil rule, we're talking about a term of art in the statute about which there was a body of preexisting precedent. What term of art can you point to here that supports your argument?"
672,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," Justice Sotomayor asked you about what happens when the  --a judge dismisses some of the federal -- the federal claims, and you responded to that. And she was referring to (c)(3),  which only refers to the district court dismissing those claims. It says  -- but (c)(3) says nothing about the instance in which the party amends the complaint and  eliminates the federal claims. Would you address that?"
673,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," But  -- but do you agree that when the district court dismisses a claim, it remains in the case?"
674,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, Do we normally think of a complaint that's amended by the party to eliminate a federal claim as still having that claim?
675,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, So when does an amended complaint supersede the earlier complaint?
676,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," When many courts of appeals have considered a question and they've all decided it the same way, that certainly requires very respectful consideration. They are very likely correct. But would you also recognize that there can be circumstances in which there can be sort of a snowball effect in busy courts of appeals, particularly on certain -- a certain  category of issues so that if a court of appeals decides a question one way, then the next one just latches onto that, and pretty soon, courts of appeals confronting an issue are very likely to say:  Wow, if all these other circuits have gone this way, I'm not going to create a conflict in the circuits on this, I'm just going to go along with it. Do you think that's a  --a dynamic that can occur in courts of appeals and, if so, should we take it into account?"
677,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Well, do you think that  --that courts of appeals read our decisions differently than we may?  I mean, you know, I'm  --I was on a court of appeals for 15 years. If I saw a strong dictum in a Supreme Court decision, I would very likely just salute and move on. But, here  -- (Laughter.)"
678,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," -- both when we're considering  -- you know, when we're considering what we've written  -- we know how these things are written. You know, we know how these footnotes are written. Can -- do we have liberty to read them a little bit differently?"
679,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," I go back to Congress knew when to adopt or not adopt a particular circuit court reading, and it didn't do anything with 1367, but it did do with diversity to codify that. So I don't know how much the old soil counts. But let's go back to first principles. What's the justification for this?  Plaintiff manipulation, correct?"
680,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," So how doesn't Rule 15 take care of that?  It gives plaintiffs a narrow window to amend and, otherwise, it needs to seek permission. So why didn't the district court simply deny permission here?"
681,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," We talked a lot about 1367, but I'm not  sure we paid much attention yet to 1447. And I -- I can certainly see the argument that the operative complaint should be the one at the time of removal under the old version of  1447, which suggests that a case should be remanded if it was improvidently removed. That -- that does seem to focus the Court's attention on the complaint at the time of removal. And I think a lot of the court of appeals kind of have been operating under  that kind of idea of the rule. But it's been amended, and it now reads that -- that a case should be remanded if  at any time it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, which, you know, just reading that, one might  -- and I'm sure we're going to hear this argument, so I wanted to give you a chance to respond to it before you sit down  -- that that focuses the Court's attention on  --on the then-operative complaint. Thoughts?"
682,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," -- for a very long time. And now it's come back to looking more directly at the -- the then-operative complaint, doesn't it?"
683,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," -- with respect to the amount in controversy. We've been around that  --that tree a few times. So putting aside that point, have you got anything else you want to say about it?"
684,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," I just want to make sure on the state of the law, and maybe following up on Justice Kagan's question, because you would think when you pick this up, if you were uninitiated, that there would be a standard rule. Look at the complaint at the time of filing or removal, or look at the complaint at the time of amendment. But at least as I looked at everything, it's just a mess, right?  There's just boxes everywhere where, you know, in the diversity context, destroying diversity almost always compels dismissal or a remand, but reducing the amount in controversy or changing citizenship of a party almost never does. Right?  Is that correct?"
685,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," And by ""settled law,"" you mean Footnote 6, you mean Cohill?  Or what are you referring to there?"
686,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Just a couple of quick points. So you keep talking about protecting the defendant's prerogative of removal. But I thought there was also sort of basic principles about the plaintiff's prerogative to bring a case in state or federal court to be the master of their claims. And so what I don't understand is why the plaintiff has to be stuck with the jurisdictional consequences of claims they are no longer bringing?  They've given up their ability to seek relief on the federal claims, and so it just seems odd to me, especially when our case law kind of generally links jurisdiction with the claim, you have to have jurisdiction for every claim, those two concepts run together, and yet somehow they can drop  claims and still be, in your view, subject to the jurisdictional consequences of that. That just seems discordant to me, so can you speak a little bit about that?"
687,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But Justice Gorsuch points to statutes that talk about remand. So, even though the defendant has exercised its right of removal, there are circumstances in which that right is not given precedence. The case goes back to state court, right?"
688,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Can I just ask you about the text, moving quickly because I'm  mindful of the time. I don't understand how the question could possibly be whether or not there is original jurisdiction at the time of removal. Of course, there is. That's why the case gets to be removed. I mean, there's no question there that does any work because you only get to remove it if there's original jurisdiction. So isn't the question really what happens when, after we've identified original jurisdiction and it's removed, the claims over which there were original jurisdiction drop out? Can supplemental jurisdiction be exercised when those original jurisdiction claims are no longer there?  When we look at the text of 1367, I don't understand your argument that supplemental jurisdiction arises in that situation because (a)  says, in any civil action of which district courts have original jurisdiction, the district court shall have supplemental jurisdiction. But, in my scenario, original jurisdiction is gone. So how can you have  supplemental jurisdiction in a situation like this?"
689,2024.23-677-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson, So wouldn't we expect it to say in which the district court had original  --or ever had original jurisdiction? It seems to be in the present tense saying that you have to have original jurisdiction in order to exercise supplemental.
690,2024.23-677-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," Mr. Keller, would you spend a bit more time on the application of 1367 and how it supports your argument?"
691,2024.23-677-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," I think not logic but experience, you lose, Mr. Keller, because the experience cuts the other way. I mean, just the -- this has all -- until the Eighth Circuit came along, the position of the Petitioners has always been understood, assumed. Every -- everybody thought that that was the rule. And it was a rule which really has no adverse consequences because everybody remands these cases anyway. In 99 percent of the cases, these -- these  --you know, there's a remand. So, like, what harm is this rule doing?  And this rule has existed in every single circuit court for lo these many years."
692,2024.23-677-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," Counsel, your friend on the other side -- were you finished?"
693,2024.23-677-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett, Your friend on the other side says that this would wreak havoc with the Class Action Fairness Act and remove cases. Do you want to address that?
694,2024.23-677-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Counsel, we have had cases where we came out the other way than every court of appeals had come out, right?"
695,2024.23-677-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Just go back to the state of the law. I certainly didn't use the word ""arbitrary.""  It's just that each bucket has developed  based on its own idiosyncratic considerations. And you can't  necessarily get a through line of look at the time of filing or the time of amendment at least as I look at them. And it's beyond just amount in controversy. It's change in citizenship as well. I just want to  --do you agree with that on the change in citizenship?"
696,2024.23-677-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Right. And then, on  Footnote 6, let me just -- I know you're going to disagree that it controls. If  --if it does control, I mean, if it is binding, it goes  against you in this case, correct?"
697,2024.23-677-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," And, you know, I just wonder, so you look at Footnote 6. To me, Footnote 6 is like somebody said:  Hey, but how about Cohill?  And then they said:  Oh, yeah, Cohill, so we have to put in Footnote 6. And  -- and so the fact that Footnote 6 is there suggests a certain kind of reading of Cohill. And, you know, what Cohill was about that it  -- was this question of do you have to dismiss a case or can you remand the case back to the state court?  But Cohill's logic does cut against you, I think, fairly heavily here because, as I read, Cohill what it does is say something like this:  You know, the supplemental  jurisdiction business, ever since Gibbs, we've understood it as a completely discretionary area of jurisdiction. You can keep the case. You can dismiss the case. If you can keep the case  and you can dismiss the case, surely you should be able to remand the case as well. And that's the essential logic of Cohill. It's like everything is discretionary  in this area, why shouldn't this be too?  But that logic really does cut against you because it suggests that everything is discretionary in this area, including keeping the case."
698,2024.23-677-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," Well, how about if I think that the text doesn't really help either of you?  The -- you know, you're saying text; you're saying text, and, in fact, neither of you really has a very strong argument about text and we have to decide this case on other grounds."
699,2024.23-677-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", Do I understand your -- what you just said to mean that you would win this case even if 1367 had never been enacted?
700,2024.23-677-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Why  --why -- why  -- why would we say Cohill addressed this?  As I understand it, in  -- the question there was whether to remand or dismiss, and this -- this issue wasn't presented to the Court at all."
701,2024.23-677-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch, And do you have any way to rationalize St. Paul Mercury other than it's been codified now?
702,2024.23-677-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," Mr. Keller, in thinking about -- you know, Justice Kavanaugh was talking about the different boxes and some of the inconsistencies. One way I've been thinking about this is I think it's been true for a very long time, back to Strawbridge versus Curtiss and the complete diversity requirement, you know, talking about Mottley and the well-pleaded complaint rule, that the Court for a very long time exercised a pretty free hand in interpreting 13-1 and --1331 and 1332. That language is identical to Article III, but yet the Court interpreted it to mean something different. And I think that in the Gibbs regime pre -1367, the Court was exercising a pretty free hand in -- in articulating the  contours of pendent jurisdiction and ancillary jurisdiction before Congress controlled it. Can you think  -- I mean, I think a lot of this case seems to kind of come down to is that just the way we've been treating jurisdictional statutes and do we keep it up with 1367, or in 1367 because, in Finley, the Court kind of said no, look, Congress, there need to be clear jurisdictional rules, expressly invited Congress to address it, which Congress did. Would you say, do you think it's fair to say, or can you think of a counter-example that in 1367, when it comes to supplemental jurisdiction, the Court has tightened its belt and isn't being as free-wheeling, or can you think of other examples where the Court, this Court, has done kind of what the court of appeals seemed to have continued to do in 1367, which is maybe make a little bit more jurisdictional policy than was set out in the text?"
703,2024.23-677-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Setting aside 1367, going back to Justice Alito's question, I'm wondering whether the sort of core principles  basis for your position is basically the plaintiff is the master of the complaint. They get to plead the claims. For federal question jurisdiction, the claims matter. That is, jurisdiction is based on the claims that the plaintiff pleads. If the claims are amended, the federal court can be divested of jurisdiction, and removal really has no bearing on the scope of jurisdiction or at least that's never been established, that  -- that how it comes to federal court matters with respect to an amended complaint. Is that roughly where you're coming from with the principles that would underlie this, even setting aside the statute?"
704,2024.23-677-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Justice Thomas?  Justice Alito? Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, counsel."
705,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," Does the government always revoke a decision when it discovers, later discovers, a sham marriage?"
706,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, Are there revocations that you think are not reviewable?
707,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, So you're saying it has to be for a reason other than the initial reason?
708,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," I mean, I get -- the government's position as far as I can tell is that you -- you just won't take yes for an answer. You want there to be review rather  than review after revocation. And they're saying you can get that. Just apply again, and you'll get exactly what you would have -- you think you're entitled to, which is judicial review of the decision. What -- what more can -- what more do you want?"
709,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Well, we'll worry about the other kinds of petitions in a case where they're raised. It seems to me that yours is pretty straightforward. And I'm sure -- I'm sure the government is sorry for the years, but it seems to me that that's the type of relief you would get. The relief is not going to be that they approve your application, right?"
710,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," So that's another  -- another case that is not like yours, right?"
711,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Well, isn't that  --isn't that the argument you're going to make on the merits when you -- if you do reapply?"
712,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Isn't that better than arbitrarily going back and forth?  I mean, the  -- the -- if the government is consistent in its practices with respect to how it exercises its discretion, isn't that what one would want  in a rule of law kind of scenario?"
713,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," What if it did? What if it started exercising discretion?  Would your case go away?  Or what if it had been conducting itself the way Justice Jackson is positing, you know, sometimes revoking it, sometimes not?  Then do you have no case? "
714,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett, What if they don't give a reason for revoking it?  Do they have to?
715,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," I mean, how are we supposed to know if it was because they concluded it actually was a sham marriage?"
716,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," But we're interpreting the statute. I mean, the statute  doesn't itself require a reason, right?"
717,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," Counsel, I  -- I -- you've conceded that 1155 doesn't say mandatorily you have to revoke, correct?"
718,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," Well, you think the  -- the fact that they didn't revoke makes it waiveable?  They could -- that makes no sense to me."
719,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," -- what do you do with 1182(i), which allows the attorney general to waive the fraud bar if the applicant is the spouse of a U.S. citizen and refusing admission would result in extreme hardship to the citizen?  It seems to me that if the government chose -- it just hasn't, but that doesn't mean much to me. If it chose, if someone was here,  let's say, 50 years, I suspect there's going to be a lot of movement for the government not to revoke on the basis of sham  marriage. "
720,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," So, if they're not obligated to, they can't waive either?  Well, your  -- "
721,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Why does it matter whether the government, in fact, has been exercising discretion?  1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) strips jurisdicti on over decisions Congress specified to be in the agency's discretionary authority. It uses the term ""authority.""  So why does practice matter? "
722,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Well, if you concede that interpretation of the provision that I just mentioned, then what do you do with a very straightforward statutory argument, if you put  that together with 1255, you're in a lot of trouble?"
723,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," If I understand the argument, it's that we're supposed to ignore the very discretionary language of 1255 because of the very non-discretionary language of 1154(c). But the non-discretionary language of 1154(c) does not pertain to revocations. It applies -- it pertains instead to the initial approval or denial of a petition. And you're saying, well, how could it be that you  -- that that wouldn't also pertain to revocations?  But there might be good reasons  why Congress would have thought, no matter what you do or no matter what we demand that you do at the initial stage, once you've already given a petition, there might be reasons to just keep the status quo going. There might be  --it might be costly to change. There might be reliance interests. Whatever. The --the decision to revoke is just different from the decision to approve or deny in the first instance. So this language about approving or denying in the first instance doesn't really speak to the decision to revoke, which is instead governed by 1255."
724,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito, anything?  No? Justice Barrett?"
725,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Yes. Can I just quickly ask about  --your client is not in removal, right?"
726,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," So it wasn't  -- it wasn't briefed, though, in this case?"
727,2024.23-583 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson, So any holding against you would have to make clear that we're reserving that issue?
728,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas, But don't you think it's a bit odd that the underlying determination initially was not discretionary and now it is being disposed of after the fact in a discretionary way?
729,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Ms. Sinzdak, your friend on the other side suggested that the government has never exercised its discretion to overlook a sham marriage. Is that correct?"
730,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch, Okay. The other question I had is your friend on the other side also suggests that this obligation of approval is ongoing because you cannot grant a green card either or any kind of visa relief in the end if there is a sham marriage. Is that right?
731,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," But, other than that carveout for an effect on a U.S. citizen, the  bar is mandatory?"
732,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," The  --the case -- cases below which you cite and rely on have this broad reading of the bar. But many of them, including the Eleventh Circuit, also permit  review on an allegation of procedural error, including, it seems, procedural error of regulations that the  --the agency's adopted itself. Where do you stand on whether those decisions are reviewable?"
733,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," So, even if the government completely abandons its existing procedures, ignores them willy -nilly, that's not reviewable in the government's view?"
734,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," You said that you didn't know of a case in which revocation wasn't the decision, but you -- but you also said you didn't know of a policy that made revocation automatic. Is that what you said?"
735,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," I  --I understand. We're talking about, in practice, do they think of themselves as having a policy of yes, of course, we would always revoke?  Or do they think of themselves as having something like: Well, of course, we would usually revoke, but we retain the right to not revoke in certain circumstances?"
736,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," So what you're saying  is that there really are no set of circumstances in which they would say, in this case, because  of the peculiarities of this case, we're not going to revoke?"
737,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," Well, I guess, you know, the ""in general"" in that sentence, is it in general, or is it always?  Like, when you talk to them, do they say:  Of course, we always revoke?"
738,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," So I'm asking, do they have a policy of never -- of always revoking?"
739,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Do you agree that Bouarfa could obtain judicial review by refiling a petition in this case?  The government's not going to pop up and say if he tries to do that, no?"
740,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Then she could get review judicial review at that point?  All right. The applicability of the judicial review bar in 1252 it seems to me is a threshold determination that hasn't been briefed here. So, if we agree with you that the discretionary nature -- about the discretionary nature of the revocation provision, would you have any problem with a line that expressly preserves that threshold question?"
741,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," No, I mean, you -- you  -- you -- you think the issue comes out in the government's favor, but, clearly, it's a threshold question. I mean, we have  -- we --we -- we would have to decide whether 1252 applies. And my concern is that by just jumping to your conclusion -- let's say I, for the purpose of this, agree with you that this is a discretionary decision under 1154 or 1155. We only get to precluding judicial review through 1252, correct?"
742,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," In other words, the -- the -- the judicial stripping -- the -- the jurisdiction stripping comes from 1252?"
743,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Yes. Setting that aside, the parties here have been assuming that the jurisdiction stripping is coming from 1252?"
744,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," And 1252 says you don't have jurisdiction of discretionary decisions. And so the argument here has been about whether or not this is a discretionary  decision. But there's a threshold issue because it seems to me  --at least I haven't found a case in which we have applied 1252 jurisdiction stripping in the non-removal context. So, if we were to suddenly say in agreement with you this is discretionary and, therefore, there's jurisdiction stripping under 1252, we would be assuming that 1252 applies in this context. And so I'm asking you  --you know, your counsel on the other side says, yes, we're all over here looking at the nature of this. Is it discretionary?  But you should at least make clear that there is this threshold issue and preserve it because we have not briefed it. Is the government on board with at least that little  --even though I know you think you win."
745,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But we have to decide it. I mean, I'm just saying I don't want the answer to this question to necessarily decide -- and there's a  -- there's a cert petition, I understand, that's coming up that's asking just this question. Amicus here says this is a separate question. We don't have to -- you all haven't briefed the answer to this question, correct?"
746,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," Justice Gorsuch's hypothetical would give rise to a constitutional challenge, wouldn't it?"
747,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor, That if  --if the INS just decided to throw the pile of applications on the floor?
748,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch, The government has no position on whether an individual can raise a constitutional claim about a -- a  -- a --a violation in revocation?
749,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," After the denial of the visa at the end of this process, which, as your friend points out, is a continuing process, but not after the revocation decision itself? That's the government's view?"
750,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Don't you think that's an important thing for us to know in terms of interpreting the scope of this, to say,  if we're going to insulate substantive and procedural determination  --questions, arbitrary-and-capricious-type decisions, the throwing the papers up in the air, and perhaps  that's what happened here, we don't know for all we know, don't you think it's important for us to understand whether you'd really even bar  constitutional questions?"
751,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," If you agree that it's reviewable at the end of the process, the visa process, why wouldn't the same be true here?  This question of the sham-marriage determination, would be  --would it be reviewable at the end of  --at the end of the process?"
752,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch, Okay. So it's reviewable at the beginning. It's reviewable at the end. You're just saying this one's not reviewable in the middle?
753,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," And on constitutional claims, we don't know?  Wait?"
754,2024.23-583 -t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito, anything further?  No? Justice Jackson -- oh, Justice Barrett?  Thank you, counsel."
755,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," Are there other benefits other than cash under -- under, what is it, Title XVI?"
756,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," Could you clarify for me the Medicare  -- the Medicaid regulation that the government replies  --relies on?  It's some  --it has something to do with, if someone's on Medicaid, if they receive more than $30 a month in income, they're no longer eligible for SSI?"
757,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Ms. Sherry, am I correct  -- I just want to clarify that you're not challenging any of the specific codes, because people fall out for different reasons, you know, wrong address and all of that, some of the S codes?"
758,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," But you're not challenging any of those, and the D.C. Circuit held that those challenges were waived?"
759,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," -- if you --if you lost, it's still possible for you in other litigation, if -- even if not on remand, if it's waived, to challenge particular codes?"
760,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," So, as a textual matter, you seem to be distinguishing program eligibility, as you say, and eligibility for a payment, and I'm just wondering whether that's pretty common. I mean, I sort of conceive of other benefits programs in the federal scheme in a similar way. I sort of thought that's what we were saying in Empire, that you could have Medicare where you have criteria for program eligibility, but just because you don't get the benefit doesn't mean that you don't qualify for the DSH fraction. Is that sort of how your argument works?"
761,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," The larger group of program eligibility because it doesn't, in your view, make any sense that whether or not a person gets a payment is  --has some sort of relationship to the DSH fraction?"
762,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Can I step back a minute, Ms. Sherry, and just ask you about the nature of your argument?  Because you start both  in the briefs and then again this morning, you know, by saying ""entitled to benefits"" can't  mean the same thing when it's used twice in one  -- can't mean different things when it's used twice in one sentence. But, of course, this is ""entitled to benefits under Medicare"" and ""entitled to benefits under SSI.""  And -- and Empire was all about what ""entitled to benefits under the Medicare program"" meant. I mean, it did a sort of micro-analysis of the Medicare statute and its structure and its purposes and its text. So, if we thought that the SSI program was completely different, if we thought that  -- and I know your argument is that it's not  -- but, if we thought that, this argument about the language can't mean different things in the same sentence would completely go away, isn't that correct?"
763,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Wel l, I --I guess the question, though, is, you know, what it means to be entitled to benefits under either program. And if you thought what it meant is -- is very different to  --you know, that ""entitled to benefits under Medicare"" was very different from ""entitled to benefits under SSI"" or, similarly, that ""eligibility for benefits under Medicare"" was very different from ""eligibility for benefits under SSI,"" then that's the way you would read the statute, correct?"
764,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," So it's just that, you know, just to put it in its starkest form, in the end, this is a question about the nature of SSI, right?  If you're right, you win. If the government is right, the government wins. In the sense of is SSI a program that  gives you lots of different kinds of benefits once you qualify for it, one might go away, but you  retain the others, or is SSI just a monthly check that you get in the mail?"
765,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", Okay. So we get -- we get to those arguments. Now another argument that you have is that this is like Empire Health. But isn't Medicare different from SSI in at least two very important effect -- respects that Empire Health emphasized?  SSI payments are not automatic and they're not enduring. Isn't that -- that true?  And that is not true of Medicare?
766,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," What do you mean by the word  --I'm going to ask the government this too  --what do you mean by the word ""insurance""?"
767,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," Ms. Sherry, if we might take a hypothetical. Let  --let's say I have a 70-year-old person who's deemed eligible for SSI because of his income but then certain months in the year makes over a million dollars a month. I know that's unlikely, but let's just suppose it. Is he entitled to benefits for the full  year?"
768,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch, Is he entitled to benefits under your view for the full year?
769,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," I mean, it seems to me Medicare is quite different from this in that respect. I mean, the -- there were lots of arguments in Empire Health, but one of the main  ones was, even if you had reached the cap on hospital care, there were other kinds of care that you could access under Medicare. So you had reached the cap in terms of your hospital stay, but you could get outpatient treatment for some other condition. So the Medicare was not going away. But, here, the only thing that there is, which really is the cash payment, is going away in the months in which the person receives more than the threshold income, isn't that right?"
770,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you -- thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito?"
771,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," Assume  -- assume that the vocational rehabilitation benefit that you th ink is a part of Title XVI and the 1382h that you think is a part of it, how about if we disagree that the vocational rehab is a -- is a program run separately from Title XVI?  So what are you left with?  Are you left only with the argument that this is a  -- and it's a powerful argument, I'm not denigrating it -- that this is  an insurance program for a year, that you're guaranteed payment at least if your income is low for that year, so if you don't get it one month, you're still going to be getting it the second, third, or fourth?  That sounds like a program to me too. But part of your argument that some of my colleagues are focused on is the fact that there are no other benefits for that month."
772,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor, So why don't you spend a moment on the government's counter-arguments as to why those two provisions are not part  --they're not additional benefits?
773,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.", Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh?
774,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," I have a couple questions. On Justice Gorsuch's hypothetical about the SSI millionaire, I mean, that's  unlikely to happen in the real world, but it could happen. But couldn't it also happen that  someone on Medicare has, you know, golden insurance, private insurance that's going to cover them, so they never really need Medicare  even though they're in the Medicare program?"
775,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh, It -- it is more likely why?  Why is  -- I think it is more likely. Why is that more likely?
776,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Okay. And then last question. This is very technical, but what happens in the real world may affect how plausible it is that Congress would have chosen one interpretation over another. So, if you lose, what's going to happen, realistically, to rural hospitals and urban hospitals that serve safety net -- as safety nets?"
777,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," And hospitals will close, or do you think that's not realistic?"
778,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Yes. Justice Kagan asked you how close is this to Medicare given the way the DSH statute is constructed, and I guess I'm a little concerned that how close it is or how much it looks like or how much it operates like is really beside the point. So, if we set aside Medicare for a second and we just look at this program, and if we assume, as Justice Kagan does, that this is just about the cash payment, I am wondering about the distinction that you're drawing between eligibility for the program, which we can call entitlement, versus eligibility for the payment. As I understood it, eligibility for the program, or entitlement, gives you the assurance that in any month during the next year  when you fall below the income cap, the government will send you a check. So that's  what's left. Even in a month where you don't get a check, you know that maybe next month you will if you don't have this extra cash coming in. Am I right about that?"
779,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," And you also have the government working for you in that effort, right?  So, when you apply, you apply to this program, and you have to meet the eligibility criteria. I'm looking at the statute, and it gives the criteria of you being aged or blind or disabled. Do you have a certain income?  Do you have certain resources?  And the statute says: Shall be an eligible individual for the purposes of this subchapter. Setting aside all the other benefits, if I'm just focusing on the cash benefit, I would think one of the things that comes with  that is the government, every month, is monitoring your finances, and in any month in  which you go below the payment, they will send you a check automatically. Is that right?"
780,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," You know, X person on the street who's not enrolled in the program can't just ask the government for money. You get to do that because you are an entitled person and you met those original criteria, right?"
781,2024.23-715-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," And you get the benefit of picking up the phone and calling the government and saying:  Please send me my check -- or the government does it automatically -- in any month in which you are entitled to  --to get it, right?"
782,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," Petitioner argues that the whole purpose of this formula is to determine low-income population that is served, which is a good point. So the  -- and that enrollment in the SSI program is only for people  who are low income, even though people may fall in and out of the  --the monthly payment requirement. Why isn't she right -- why isn't Petitioner right?"
783,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas, So what difference does it make in a practical sense if your reading is accepted or her reading is accepted?
784,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But why does that matter?  I  -- I --I'm so confused by your argument, I have to say. I'm struggling to  understand why an individual's eligibility for payment in a particular month has any bearing on the goals of compensating hospitals for the  higher cost of low-income people. So let me give you a hypothetical. Imagine a man who's lived well below the poverty line for his entire life. He has a range of health conditions that result from that kind of upbringing. When he turns 65 in January, he applies for SSI payments and starts receiving them in February pursuant to the statute and  the regulations. Let's say in June he comes into a bit of cash. He inherits some jewelry. He sells it. He picks up an extra shift at work. He gets money back from a friend who owes it to him, okay?  We can all agree that if the extra cash he gets in June brings him above the threshold, he doesn't get a cash payment that month because now he's above the threshold. But the Medicare fraction, I thought, was not about how much cash a patient had in any particular month. It's about how costly it would be to treat this person. And I don't understand why it is less or more costly in June, when he has the heart attack, than in May, when he didn't  --"
785,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But why isn't that the part of the statute that DSH is referring to?  I mean, it's clear that that part of the statute says this person, the person for the year, shall be eligible under SSI. That's in the statute. So what I'm asking is, doesn't it make more sense that the DSH program, which is trying to capture people who are low income in this general sense because they will have more  serious and more difficult to treat, costly to treat, health issues, why isn't it referring to (a)?"
786,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Okay. So let me  -- I thought the choice was between (a) and (b). You say the DSH program is referencing (b), which is  --or, sorry, (c), excuse me, which is the provision that says you get a payment in a particular month. And my question to you is, why would Congress care about whether you're getting a payment in a particular month as the marker of whether you are low income and it's more costly?"
787,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," I'm not asking you a textual argument. I'm ask  --I'm just asking you a purpose. You  -- your argument seems to result in people who get cash payments who have the exact same income level as someone who didn't get a cash payment, one is counted and one is not. And what I'm asking you is, why would Congress have set up the DSH program to make that distinction?"
788,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," So let's talk to that, okay, whether it is more precise. Let me give you the hypotheticals. Someone's eligible, joins SSI in January, is hospitalized in  January, but they receive no cash payment in January. They're going to get it on February 1 because they just joined the program. Are you including those people?"
789,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor, Even though they are eligible because their -- they didn't make more money?  They should be. It's only they happen to join the program the month they got sick?
790,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor, But when -- when is she going to see it?  She's not going to see it on February 1.
791,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," I'm  --I'm confused about that, actually, because I was asking your friend on the other side these questions about, well, if there was some snafu because it bounced because of an address or something like that, whether they were challenging those codes, and she said no. But why isn't that an actual receipt rule if those people are excluded?"
792,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett, Retroactively?  So then the hospital gets the benefit of the different DSH fraction later?
793,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," --and differences with the Medicare?  So, as you're exploring these answers, you can bounce in and out of actually receiving social -- I mean SSI payments. You're in the program, they say, for a year, but you might not receive payments in a particular month. Right so far?  Medicare, the argument on the other side is similar in the sense that you're in the program, you qualified for Medicare, but you might have private insurance. Lots of people  do. And, therefore, any particular hospital stay in a given day, week, month might be paid for by your private insurance, not by Medic are. So, even though you're not getting Medicare payments, Medicare is paying zero, that, we said in Empire, is still going to be counted because you're in the program. So what's the difference between those two things?"
794,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," But it seems to me -- I don't mean to press too hard, but it seems to me you're suggesting that there are multiple reasons Medicare might not pay maybe, and there's only one reason that SSI might not pay?  Is that what you're suggesting?"
795,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh, They're both programs in which you could be receiving payment in a relevant period but not for the precise period that you're in the hospital?
796,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," But they're in the database. So let's say you drop out  -- I'm sorry to prolong it, but it's important to me at least. You drop out for a month. The next month -- because your income's gone above the limit. The next month, your income is below the limit. Do you have to do anything to receive the benefits in that next month?"
797,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," -- when your income goes below the limit, do you have to do anything to receive the benefits in the next month?  I think your answer was no."
798,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But you don't have to reapply, right?  I think that's Justice Kavanaugh's question."
799,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," If I could understand this, you know, because these -- these are really important questions. What you're saying is that in Medicare, we were looking at a program where, even if you had reached the cap for hospital care, there were many other kinds of medical care that one could access the insurance program for. You could access it for home health. You could access it for outpatient treatment. You could keep getting stuff from Medicare even though you had reached the cap on hospital care, is that correct?"
800,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," And we all know that health insurance works that way because we reach the cap on one thing and we keep on benefitting from our insurance on another thing, right? That's just the way insurance --"
801,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," Then the question is: Okay, well, what about these references to the annual -- you know, what  --what about these annual measures?  Aren't you sort of in the program for a year even though you're not getting payment for particular months?  Right?"
802,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan, And -- and there are those references in the statute. What are they there for?
803,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," And the fact that you don't have to apply  -- I mean, this is a very -- reapply for, you know, 12 months' time, this is a pretty sensible provision from everybody's perspective, right?"
804,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," You mentioned 1383. And one of the provisions in 1383, Mr. McDowell, concerns the ability of SSA to secure financial records, and it says that it continues ""until the cessation of the recipient's eligibility of benefits.""  Doesn't that suggest that eligibility for benefits doesn't fluctuate from month to month?  Because, otherwise, SSA, I suppose, wouldn't be able to access a recipient's records for the months in which his income goes above the threshold."
805,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Just two more quick questions. One, the D.C. Circuit, in places, seemed to adopt an actual receipt rule, which you have disavowed. Would an affirm, in your view, be the appropriate  --that's what your brief asks us to do, is affirm. Is that the appropriate remedy given some of the language in the D.C. Circuit opinion talking about actual receipt?"
806,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson, Can you help me to understand why you think that there aren't threshold eligibility criteria in this statute?
807,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," You pointed to 1383. But what about 1381a and 1382a, both of which seem to be pointing to age, blindness, and disability as threshold criteria, in addition to income?  And if that's the case, I'm wondering why those aren't the kinds of things that  one -- the government assesses at the outcome to determine your eligibility for the program, and then they may do the monthly assessment of income pursuant to the rest of the statute."
808,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Right. But what about disability?  Each application  -- every monthly application, when you call up and you say, please give me the check, I've fallen out one month, do -- do they reassess your disability status?"
809,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," No, no, no, I'm not asking discretion. I'm asking:  What does the government do?"
810,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Because it seems to me that if the government does not reassess the threshold criteria of disability, then you're in the program based on the government's initial disability determination, correct?"
811,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," So what I'm asking you is:  Isn't that initial assessment the same kind of thing as the threshold determination that happens in most benefit programs, and then you're in the program and then the monthly assessment occurs to give you the benefit or not?"
812,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," I'm sorry, how -- how can you get to (c)?  1382a  -- 1382, (1) says, right, you make a determination of their eligibility on the basis of income and resources. Then, when you get to 1382a, which is the next provision, it says ""eligible individual defined,"" and it is set up to make the determination on the basis of income an d resources."
813,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," I'm just saying, but isn't 1382a relevant to the determination of who is an eligible individual?"
814,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," If you're under 65 and disabled, that's  --you apply, right?"
815,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," I think that the -- Ms. Sherry's idea for how this is insurance -- and she'll correct me if I'm wrong  -- but the -- the idea is that even if you run over the threshold in a particular month, that you know that you're going to get the benefit in the next month when you go under the threshold, even without a reapplication. So the insurance, which she said really -- isn't really insurance; it's sort of assurance  -- is that I have an assurance for a period of a year that I won't have to reapply when I go under the threshold again. So what should we make of that?"
816,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," On the consequences that Ms. Sher ry talked about for the hospitals, are you saying those are -- as a factual matter, you disagree with the predictive judgment in the amicus brief and in the Petitioners'?  Or are you saying, yeah,  hospitals could close, but that's the nature of a program and the limited resources?"
817,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," I think there are three things. You might not qualify for DSH at all. If you do qualify  -- because of the cutoff, the 15 percent. If you do qualify, the benefits might be less. And you might not qualify for 340B. Those are the three buckets of things, right?"
818,2024.23-715-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you -- thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito? Justice Gorsuch, anything further? Okay. All right. Justice Jackson? Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Ms. Sherry?"
819,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, Would you spend a minute or so explaining how your approach would  work in comparison to the government's approach?
820,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," But it's a pretty unusual law, right?  It says that the administration shall take account of, take due account of. It -- it doesn't seem that they're changing the legal standard at all. It just says sort of be more careful. And to take from that instruction some change in the legal standard of review, I think, is  -- is quite a leap."
821,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Can you be a little bit more specific when you say it was supposed to be -- the court, the Veterans Court, was supposed to be doing that all along?  What  exactly is the ""that""?"
822,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," And you say no -- and you say no deference should be given to the Veterans  --to the administration, to the agency, with making that determination?"
823,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Wouldn't you expect that Congress, if they thought that the  standard of review was wrong, instead of saying take due account, would have said review de novo?"
824,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Well, how could this not be a factual question?  I mean, I could understand it if you were looking at a decision by the Sec retary or the Board where they completely ignored the benefit -of -the-doubt rule or where  --or where they gave the benefit of the doubt to the wrong party. Then I can see your saying, well, look, they made a legal error and that's subject to de novo review. But assume that they do that. Assume that they just say, you know, we don't -- we don't see that this case is in equipoise, so we're not giving the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. And then the court takes another look at it. I would think that what the court is doing is to evaluate how the Board has evaluated evidence, weighed evidence, contrasted one party's evidence with another party's evidence, decided which is the more credible. All of that sounds like typical factual issues, factual determinations."
825,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," No, I think it would be a  --it w ould be a mistake, it would be a legal error if they said, we're disregarding the fact that the claimant was entitled to the -- the benefit of the doubt in the proceeding before the administration. That would be a mistake in applying the applicable law. But, if they apply the applicable law, then what is the problem with reviewing the finding under the clear-error standard?  Do you agree that that would be appropriate?"
826,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," So that's done in almost -- in so few areas of law, most of them constitutional. Like, is there probable cause? I  -- I don't know of any other area of civil law where we view mixed questions of law and fact as predominantly legal."
827,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Ms. Bostwick, can I  -- can I ask you just about the scope of your argument for a moment?  You say that the Veterans Court must consider this sua sponte in every case, but both of your clients did raise the benefit-of-the -doubt argument. So why should we even reach that question?"
828,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Well, I do have one quick question about Mr. Thornton. Since he did receive benefits, I just don't understand exactly what he stands to gain because, because of his unemployability, wasn't he given complete disability?  So what further relief could he get if he wins before us?"
829,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," I'd like to follow up on -- on -- on Justice Barrett's question, Ms. Bostwick. The party presentation question wasn't really squarely addressed in either of the lower court opinions, and I wonder whether we should, as a court of review rather than first view, give them the chance to tackle that first and just address the question of, when it is presented, must -- must it be interpreted the way you  -- you --you propose? What do you think of that?"
830,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," I -- I -- I know that, but would you object to a partial win  rather than a complete one, counsel?"
831,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch, And you're asking (b)(1) to be interpreted in the same manner?
832,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Are you  -- are you just asking for another line in the opinion saying our conclusions take due account of what it's supposed to, and then that's -- because, I  mean, your friend on the other side says that this really doesn't add anything. And you seem to be saying no, they have to look at this and this. So what -- I mean, I know you want a different result in this case, but in terms of the analysis, what are you looking for?"
833,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," And going back to Justice Gorsuch's point, we do see parallel language between (b)(1) and (b)(2), so I just want to be clear that (b)(2) does have this sort of separate obligation, is that right, by the court?  In other words, (b)  -- sorry, Chief."
834,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?"
835,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Let me just pursue for a second the example that you gave earlier in your argument about a hypothetical case in which there are two experts who testify on the question of the linkage between the disability and service. And let's say in that situation the  -- the Veterans Administration finds that even taking into  -- even giving the claimant the benefit of the doubt, the expert who says that there is no linkage is more persuasive, okay?  Now that finding would be dispositive of the claim for benefits, would it not?"
836,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Right. They say: Taking into account the approximate balance, the approximate balance is not in favor of the claimant, it is against the claimant, all right? So that is a finding. And let's assume it's dispositive of the  -- of the claim for benefits. And then there is  -- then there is a review in the Veterans Court. Is it your argument that the finding of fact as to which expert is more credible is subject to de novo review or clear-error review?"
837,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Well, let's say that there is a finding of fact on every piece of evidence, and on all of these pieces of evidence, the finding of fact is that, even  giving the claimant the benefit of the doubt, the fact has not been proved. Then what is the standard of review before the Veterans Court?  Do you say that -- that that is  --although each of them is subject to clear error -- each of these findings is subject to clear -error review, when you put it all together, that is a question of law that is subject to de novo review?  Is that your argument?"
838,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Why wouldn't that apply in  --in every civil bench trial?  The question of whether the  -- the -- the -- the judge erred in rejecting a particular civil claim, that would be a -- in your view, that's a -- that's a question of law?"
839,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.", But it takes into account the  -- the findings on all the subsidiary facts?
840,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," What is the difference between (b)(1) and (b)(2)?  (b)(2) says:  Take due account of the rule of prejudicial error. And that's because the Secretary doesn't do that, correct?"
841,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor, So it's only the  -- it's the Veterans Court that has to do that because it's the only one charged with doing it?
842,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," All right. So it has to apply it. But (1) says:  Take due account of the Secretary's obligation  -- application of Section 5107(b). That's substantially different. It's asking a -- it's asking them to review what someone else has done, correct?"
843,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," And so that comes -- may come to a different standard of review, correct?"
844,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," I just want to make sure I understand. Do you agree with the description of the benefit-of-the -doubt rule, that it's essentially just a change in the burden of proof, right?  Usually, a claimant comes in and he has to meet a 51 percent burden. And what the benefit-of-the -doubt rule does is to sa y:  No, if you meet 50 percent, you win, and maybe even a little bit more because it's an approximate balance. So maybe, if you go 49 percent, you win. But that's what this rule is. It's just a shift in the burden of proof?"
845,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Okay. So it's in the  --right. Like, even if you don't get up to 50 percent, maybe because we find that there is an approximate balance, you still win. But that's just a -- a -- a -- that's just another way of shifting the burden of proof. That's what this rule is?"
846,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Yeah. So why isn't  -- the way we usually do this -- it's like usu ally, in, like, a totally factual case, where you have all these subsidiary factual findings and then you have a question of whose facts weigh more heavily, whose facts are more credible, and we usually think about that as, like, was it clear error to find that the claimant didn't meet his 51 percent burden of proof?  Now we just say:  Is it clear error to find that the plaintiff didn't meet his slightly less stringent burden of proof?  But it's still clear error."
847,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch, That -- that -- that's just what it is. Now that standard is: Could any reasonable juror come to this conclusion?  But that's the legal standard we ask based on the evidence that's given.
848,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," And you're here asking us essentially to say, take all the non-clearly erroneous facts and ask:  Was the Secretary's approximate  -- instead of a sufficiency line, whether the -- whether the Secretary's determination that they were not in approximate balance is correct?"
849,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch, And what's an approximate balance?  Nobody knows. But that's -- that's what -- what you were talking with Justice Kagan about. It's something less than 50 percent.
850,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," Right?  It's  --it's basically:  Were they crazy in -- in choosing  this one fact over the other fact?  And they were not crazy. So there's no clear error. But, as a matter of law, you would say, as  I understand your argument, that, hey, those are really pretty similar, and the Secretary's decision that it wasn't decisively in favor, I think is the language you used, or something like that, in favor of -- of -- of the government means that -- that this standard has teeth and should be applied?"
851,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," Okay. And in the same way that -- that the prejudicial error language works, we take all the non-clearly erroneous facts and say:  Okay, would this error have made any difference?"
852,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," And, second, can you quantify or try to quantify what approximate balance is?"
853,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," So just a final point on this. You've said a couple of times that this area is involving a unique standard, and what I took you to mean is that the app roximate balance standard itself, the 5017(b) standard, is unique, but what you're asking of the Court, the rule that you would like to have applied here is very similar to what courts do when they evaluate sufficiency of the evidence, as you had in the dialogue with Justice Gorsuch. Is that what you're saying?  So we're not  --you're not asking for something new and different by the Court with respect to the assessment here?"
854,2024.23-713-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But we're still doing the same -- qualitatively, same kind of review as a sufficiency-of-the -evidence review?"
855,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," Well, in order for you  -- us to accept your argument, don't we have to accept that Congress passed a meaningless provision?"
856,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch, What's the difference between a duplicative work and a redundancy?
857,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," I think Justice Thomas's question is, if (a) does all the work, what does (b) do?"
858,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," -- already. And the -- 46 question is, is that what this does?"
859,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr.", -- I --I want to go back before you get off it. What other examples do you have of Congress passing a law that doesn't do anything?
860,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Well, but that seems to me that there's a legal determination and that the law that you're talking about sort of pointed the Court in the right direction. I mean, here, it was an eye-catching sentence in your brief for me when you said the amendment would serve a useful purpose even if it simply confirmed and emphasized a preexisting legal duty. Now this is not part of a complicated law where they wanted to say and we want you to do this. This was freestanding, right?  It said this is what you get in the veterans groups making a  --a fairly significant push to get this fixed from their point of view. And you say what they got was something that didn't do anything."
861,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," That's why  -- why -- yeah. Why are you accepting the premise that it didn't do anything?  It seems to me the way you're describing it, it did something important, which was describing the practice at least in some cases by the Veterans Court where they weren't separately analyzing it in light of the benefit-of-the -doubt rule and telling the Veterans Court you need to take due account of the benefit-of-the -doubt rule. That is accomplishing something. And, in fact, as you say, the proof's in the pudding, then the Veterans Court and the -- they're doing that, right?"
862,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But doesn't -- doesn't it depend on the complaint that's being made, though?  I mean, that's why I think it's really important that we understand what the veterans were complaining about to begin with. If the sum total of the complaint was that the Veterans Court was completely ignoring the benefit-of-the -doubt rule, it never raised it, it didn't say anything about it, et cetera, then I suppose you could have an argument that a subsequent amendment that was designed to remind the Veterans Court that this obligation existed makes sense. But, if the complaint was maybe there are times when a court is completely ignoring it, but what we really are worried about is that we're not actually getting it, that they're saying benefit of the doubt or whatever, but then, when they're applying it, they are not actually giving us  --they're not evaluating whether the evidence is in equipoise properly; when it is in equipoise, they're not giving it to us. In that circumstance, if that was the complaint, it seems odd that Congress would just come back and point to the benefit-of-the-doubt rule as opposed to saying we need a court that's actually policing the extent to which the Veteran  --the administration is giving people what we said in 5017."
863,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," No, not gap, meaning the gap in the statute would be we don't have the ability to bring this to the court's attention. We all agree that before, under the existing statute, under the existing circumstances, they could make a claim about the benefit-of-the -doubt rule. The question is, when Congress amended the statute to say something to the Veterans Court, weren't they  -- this is the other side's argument  --weren't they saying what we need you to do is to make sure that the agency is actually applying this consistent with the law?  And that's why it becomes, as Justice Gorsuch suggested, a legal question, because just like the sufficiency of the evidence is a  standard in the law and we want to make sure that the evidence is sufficient, here, Congress is saying you need to make sure, court, that when this comes to you, it's not just a deference to the agency, whatever they did with respect to benefit of the doubt, but you're actually making clear that they met the legal standard of giving the veteran what they're entitled to under this statute."
864,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson, But isn't it a question of law?  It is a -- we  --we evaluate it as --
865,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," -- it is a -- it is a legal standard, though, isn't it?  Because we  --"
866,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," -- can I ask, Mr. Joshi, how would you describe what the reviewing court -- how the reviewing court is supposed to take into account the benefit-of-the -doubt rule in  conducting its review?"
867,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," So -- so, in the --in the usual case where a claimant has a 51 percent standard, you would say, did the Board clearly err in -- in deciding that the plaintiff did not meet his 51 percent standard?"
868,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," And your  --if I understand the difference between you and Ms. Bostwick, Ms. Bostwick says, look  -- she accepts that all the individual facts should be reviewed only for clear error, right, so that, like, any particular factual matter is -- gets clear-error review, any particular factual determination. But this ultimate balance and the ultimate determination of whether the w eight of the evidence indicates that the plaintiff did or did not meet the standard is an entirely legal question. And the difference is you're saying it's not a legal question, that last bit, that that last bit is at  --is at most -- it's either a pure factual question or it's the kind of mixed question that U.S. Bank was talking  about when it talked about mixed questions that immerse courts in case -specific factual issues, compelling them to marshal and weigh evidence and make credibility judgments. Is that correct?"
869,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," If that's the case, then what do we do about the fact that courts all the time do sufficiency-of-the -evidence review de novo based on the record, again, in the light most favorable?  And the -- the next section of (b) -- (b)(2) is the same  -- works the same way, I think, on your -- on your understanding as well, that the court, in deciding whether there's harmless error, takes all the non -clearly erroneous facts and asks de novo whether, as a matter of law, it would have made any difference, the -- the -- the error, that is."
870,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch, We normally read statutes in pari materia. And (b)(2) you agree is a  --is a de novo legal standard the Court has to apply when raised?
871,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," Does the approximate balance determination go only to the final conclusion, or does it go as well to  subsidiary factual conclusions, just to make sure we're clear on that?"
872,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," How big a deal is this?  I mean, I can imagine there are not that many situations in which the evidence is truly an approximate balance. So even if the government's position is  -- you know, if we agreed with the Petitioner here, is this going to be a big deal?"
873,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," I know. But then why  -- why did Congress clearly require the court to do it?  I  -- this is the thing that's a little unfortunate in a way in the way that I think you're arguing it because, even if we say Congress went back and underscored this obligation, the approximate balance obligation runs to the Secretary, right, and the underscoring is now to the court. So it's obvious that Congress wanted the court to have some assessment of whether or not the Secretary is doing it correctly. So I think you -- you don't get out of that by just saying, oh, the court is not well positioned. Congress thought the court was going to do something, right?"
874,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," -- that the deference that you say Congress wanted to retain was in the assessment of what evidence is positive and negative?  In other words, the -- the approximate balance rule says when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter. And I could see a world in which the Secretary's assessment of whether this evidence is material to this issue, is it, you know, credible and, therefore, I'm going to count it as positive?  Is it credible on the negative side?  All of those individual  determinations the court cannot review for anything other than clear error. But I thought you said earlier in this conversation  --and maybe I misheard you -- that you did think that approximate balance itself, once we know what the positive -- bucket of positive evidence and bucket of negative evidence is, is a question of law. I thought I heard you say it was a question of law."
875,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Right. So  -- so -- so those would not be credible. They wouldn't be in the bucket. And when the court did its assessment of whether there's approximate balance, it would say there's not, right?"
876,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Thank you, -- 75 counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?"
877,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," I have a question. The Chief started with whether this was a redundant, duplicate, unimportant provision or not. It's pretty absolute. The language of the BOPDR review provision say s the court ""shall"" review that issue. Yet you say, no, they don't really have to unless the party presents it. If I say no, you're wrong, that doesn't make this provision superfluous, does it?"
878,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," You don't want that outcome, but that's how to avoid the superfluous  -- how --making this provision superfluous, correct?"
879,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," And wouldn't that also take care of everything you said was wrong with the old system, which was -- and I remember that veterans are generally no t represented. They're laypeople. And recognizing that they  may not be schooled enough to raise an issue on appeal, wouldn't this provision require the -- the Veterans Court to ensure that the court below has actually done everything it needed to do, that it looked at all of the relevant  facts and didn't commit the legal error of avoiding one, whether raised to it or not, and whether or not it committed clear error in its balance or not, et cetera?  It would do a lot of work to ensure the system was actually taking care of the problem Congress saw, wouldn't it?"
880,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor," But your colleague on the other side, in her presentation, pointed out to one issue that Mr. Thornton allegedly did not raise. What do I do about that?"
881,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Do you think Congress adopted this language about the benefit-of-the -doubt rule, in both instances where it did, in recognition of the high esteem in which our nation holds those who have served in the armed services?"
882,2024.23-713-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Justice Kavanaugh?  Justice Jackson?  Okay. Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Ms. Bostwick?"
