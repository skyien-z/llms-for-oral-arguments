Maley</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The prevailing party is the party who wins the lawsuit, obtaining a final judgment in its favor, or at least a party who obtains a ruling that the defendant is liable on the merits of one or more claims, such as a summary judgment or a judgment as a matter of law. A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds. It provid es no enduring relief. By its nature, it is a temporary procedural order that dissolves upon final judgment. A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies. Legal dictionaries at the time Congress enacted Section 1988 defined  ""prevailing party"" based on whether the party had successfully maintained its claim, looking to the end of the suit, not on its degree of success at earlier stages. This Court's precedent similarly provides that liability for fees and liability on the merits go hand in hand. The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party.

The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party. I look forward to this Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You --can a consent decree or a default judgment support a prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG</text>","<speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  ""Prevailing party"" is a longstanding term of art that means the party for whom judgment is entered, which turns on whether, at the end of the suit, the plaintiff has successfully maintained at least one claim for relief. This Court has repeatedly determined that liability on the merits and liability for fees go hand in hand such that the plaintiffs  -- plaintiff must obtain at least some relief on  the merits of his claim to be a prevailing party. A preliminary injunction reflects a preliminary determination, not a final  determination, that rests on a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits, not actual success on those merits. Sole versus Wyner thus determined that a preliminary injunction's  tentative character makes a fee request at that preliminary initial stage premature. And after that, in this case, the case became moot due to legislative action that Buckhannon teaches does not confer prevailing party status. Now, while a plaintiff whose case is dismissed might not lose on the merits, Section 1988 does not award fees to non-losing parties. It requires prevailing party status.

Yang</speaker><text> No. No, I don't  --I don't. There's only one statute, by the way, that predates Section 1988. It's Section 1617, which is discussed by the Court in Bradley. All  that does is clarifies that you don't need a true final judgment that ends the case. A final judgment normally is one that resolves all  claims and ceases to terminate -- terminates the case. In the context of -- of Section 1617, that's in the context of school desegregation injunctive orders, and in that context, you often will have a final order, which is a  -- you know, even if it doesn't resolve all claims, but it's final, it's on the merits, you're granting relief on the merits, but the injunction may need to be tweaked as we go along because just any kind of complicated institutional injunction is going to have to be tweaked. That's all Section 1617 requires. It does not depart -- it does not change the normal understanding of ""prevailing party,"" which a prevailing party is one who succeeds at the end of the case because they obtain judgment on at least one claim.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counsel  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say, if I understand it, you don't have to get final judgment on all the claims, right?  You just need to prevail on one.

Yang</speaker><text> No. The question -- there's multiple questions in attorney's fees cases. The first is whether you're a prevailing party. You have to succeed on at least one claim on the merits to be prevailing.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> The question then goes to how much fees. That's a  --usually, it's a reasonable fee award. And the reasonableness of the fees, you -- you would look more granularly to determine whether the case -- the issues were intertwined or not. If they're completely separate issues and you lost on them, generally, no, you don't get fees for those.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> What do you do with the case that Justice Jackson posed, which is common?

Nothing you've done or someone else has done has changed it. You got all the relief you really wanted. I wanted to protest.</text><speaker>Anthony A.

Now I think a lot of the questions have --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> We -- we keep going back to the operative question here, which is we repeatedly said you don't need a final judgment. You don't need a determination o f the merits. You can have a consent judgment. You can have this. There has to be  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> I don't think that's quite</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- a different sense.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- I don't think that's quite right. The legislative history says you don't need a final judgment following a full trial on the merits.

You get a judgment --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, summary judgment is a final judgment.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Not until you appeal it.

Yang</speaker><text> A lot of these parades are annual parades.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And I want a prospective injunction going forward.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And then we would have a final judgment on the merits  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- on at least that claim on which you would be prevailing, right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct. Correct. And I -- and I also want to address just a more general point, which is some of the questions were like:  Well, the fees have been incurred, we've got to allocate them. You know, who do  we allocate them to?  Well, that's answered by the American rule. The American rule is each party, win or lose, bears their own fees. And this Court has made clear that you need express statutory authority to depart from that rule. And the statutory --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --and isn't that the statute we're talking about here? Right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, the statute uses a term of art that's existed in statutes since at least -- the American statute since at least 1853.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but it is  -- it is addressing -- it is trying, Congress, to give us an exception to the American rule, and the question is what is the scope of that exception.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But Congress didn't go all the way. Congress adopted a term of art which had  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Prevailing party.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- a settled meaning.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask about Justice Gorsuch's example?  What if I don't want to spend the time and additional money to litigate this through to a declaratory judgment or a future?  What if I just want to march in  the parade tomorrow?  I'm a religious organization, for example. I don't  --you know, I agree with traditional marriage, and tomorrow is the LGBTQ parade and I want to march in it. I want to be able to be there. I  -- I'm not making a whole thing out of it.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I -- I get that. I go to court and I argue the merits of my entitlement  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to be able to do that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And the court says, as a preliminary matter, we don't have a whole trial yet, I think you're going to win, so I'm giving you an injunction and you get to march in the parade.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And I do.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then I'm done. I say the case is mooted because, really, the relief that I wanted was the ability to march in the parade tomorrow. But I did have to pay an attorney to be able to convince you, court, to give me the relief that I requested. I --I guess I don't understand why, under our formulation of the test for a prevailing party in the Lefemine case, what we say  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That was a permanent injunction, and --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand it was a permanent injunction in that case, but I'm asking you, we set up a test for when you are a prevailing party, and the question is why doesn't that test also cover preliminary injunctions like the one that I talked about.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Part of that test is a judgment on the merits, and a judge  -- this is not  -- a preliminary injunction is a tentative determination that does not control anything later in the suit. It's only for the PI stage,  only to adjust the parties' relationships during the suit.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Mr. Yang, does any  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And this is important.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Ms. Maley said that she didn't know of a circuit that it accept ed -- that had accepted this categorical position, if it's a preliminary injunction, there are no fees. Do you know of any circuit that's accepted this categorical position?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, that was the Smyth rule prior to.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Yeah, prior to it being changed, and  --and so now --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, but this Court granted cert on unanimous --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- so now there's -- there's a uniform rule. You don't know of anything  --any court that's gone the other way. You know what?  It's an interesting thing. It seems that this comes up all the time, and it seems as though it's come up frequently just in recent years. When I was talking to my clerks about this, you know, several had confronted this issue with respect to COVID litigation, where  people went to courts and they asked for injunctions from various kinds of COVID policies, and then, you know, in the end, those  policies were changed or were scrapped or were abandoned in some way. So it seems as though there's quite a lot of recent law that cuts against you here from circuits, like, pretty much all across the U.S.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the circuits are not uniform. Some of them look to -- for instance, the Fifth Circuit looks to why the -- the mooting event occurred, but my -- my point -- I want to make two points. One, this Court already addressed the strategic mootness question in Buckhannon and  -- and  -- and addressed that in four different factors. There's two other factors. I want to address two of those first and then I'll go to Buckhannon. One is that Congress has struck a balance here, that there is reason for caution before abandoning what this Court has described as the crucial connection between liability for a violation of federal law on the merits, finding on the merits that you violated federal law, and attorney's fees, and there's reason to -- to give pause before doing that. Congress has sometimes been more generous with the government, but these -- this case -- this statute covers both private individuals and non-federal actors. Secondly, going to Buckhannon, the cost  --there's a cost of deterring federal government action from being voluntarily changed when it may be lawful. Litigation often puts a spotlight on a practice that might not be the best policy even though it's lawful, and the Court in Buckhannon recognized there is a cost to deterring that kind of good government change. Secondly --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Okay. I don't think that that's what I was asking about. I was asking really, you know, do you have any law out there on your side?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> We have a term of art that has gone back --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, what  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- in this Court's decisions, and -- and I think that the courts of appeals just have not been faithful to this Court's decisions.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, that  -- that raises the question for me, why -- why do you think they've been not seeing the light?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, I think sometimes there's  -- as a policy matter, you might decide, hey, you know, this  -- this --I don't like this outcome. I think some of the courts  -- and -- and I acknowledge that there might be some cases like that. But that type of policy call is for Congress to make. So, in Buckhannon, when the Court rejected the catalyst theory, Justice Ginsburg dissented and said:  Hey, look, there's one specific area that's really problematic, FOIA. Congress reacted and did a targeted response to This really goes to the appropriate separation of powers here. Congress adopts a  statute that has a term of art that goes back quite some time. This Court has repeatedly  determined that merits determination, you know, a determination of liability on the merits is crucial to then make  --making the defendant liable for fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Congress --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> The Respondents argue that there is a historical background of a venerable equitable tradition of awarding interim costs, including for a preliminary injunction, and that, if accepted, would perhaps undercut your historical argument. Do you want to say something about that?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> There's two points I would love to make about that. First, this -- this Court already resolved that argument in Alyeska Pipeline. There was a  --and it was actually Justice Marshall's dissent, which was based on equitable principles. What the Court decided in Alyeska Pipeline is that the American rule is each party bears its own costs. There are certain discrete common law exceptions that have evolved. At equity, for instance, the common fund exception,  you get a fund. It would be unjustly  -- you would unjustly enrich the people who benefit unless they pay your fees. That's a fee-sharing, not fee-shifting. Bad faith attorney's fees is another one. Contempt fees is another exception. But the Court did not say equity, you know, it's all -- you know, whatever you think is equitable. The Court recognized that there are very discrete limits. And I think that's illustrated by the only case that they cite, the only case that they cite as  --as supporting a PI fee award, and that's Clancy versus Geb. In that case, it was not based on the temporary injunction that was issued on the day the suit was filed. The court said it was based on the trial on the merits that sustained the cause of action for an injunction. Now, after the trial on the merits, the court didn't grant further injunctive relief, and that might be a problem, but it certainly does not  stand for the proposition that a TRO or, you know -- or a PI gets you prevailing party status. There was a final adjudication on the merits of the -- of the cause of action.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Just to be clear, Buckhannon, there was no court -ordered relief whatsoever, correct?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's true. That's true.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as I read the decision, that was mostly the focus of the decision?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, certainly, the catalyst theory was  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It was the prime focus.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- but the catalyst --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- theory does not -- we're not escaping the catalyst theory here because  the catalyst theory is embedded in this case. It is the second -- it is what happened with this case after --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you're  -- you're -- you're claiming there is no catalyst theory because you're saying the legislature acted -- or the other side is saying it acted independently, so it -- it has nothing to do --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the catalyst theory was rejected in Buckhannon.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> They're saying it doesn't matter why the case ends. It just ended with a judgment, dismissal of the action. It could be for mootness. It could be because the other side gave up. I got what I came for at least in part. I got my license back. I drove for 16 months. I didn't have to pay anybody to get my license back. I won for those  --that part of my relief. And it's never been dissolved, reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But that's not what the term ""prevailing party"" has been understood, either by this Court or by the dictionary definitions that date back from before the -- the  -- the 20th Century. That has required a final adjudication  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well, that's the problem. No, it's never required a final adjudication. It's required a judgment but not a final one.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it has. I mean, even  --even the legislative history -- this Court in Hanrahan discussed the legislative history. It's all in dicta, but it discussed the legislative history of Section 1988, and what  --the conclusion the Court drew was that interim fees, meaning before the case is finally over, only -- were available only when the party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of its claims. And that happens when you get a final determination, maybe not a final judgment because you're not resolving all claims or maybe because there's some ongoing litigation about the nature of the injunctive relief.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Yang. We -- we have a difference of opinion on what finality means. If all you're seeking  is a preliminary injunction, that's final for that purpose.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> You don't  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That  -- that's the problem we're having.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --file suits for preliminary injunctions. You file suits for  equitable relief, a judgment at the end of the suit. A preliminary injunction is a preliminary matter that protects the parties while the suit is adjudicated.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Let me see if I've got it. So a PI can't be the basis for a  --a -- an award of fees under this statute because Sole basically says you have to look at what happens afterwards. And for all the reasons you just gave, a PI is a PI. It's preliminary. It's not  --okay. All right. Fine. Now  -- so we have to look what happened afterwards. And, here, what happened afterwards is plaintiffs may well have convinced  the Virginia state legislature to change their mind in a catalyst sort of way.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> The problem is Buckhannon says that doesn't work either.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. But Justice Ginsburg in Buckhannon says, hey, Congress should fix that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And Congress did fix it in FOIA --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yep.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and said involuntary  -- voluntary cessation and changes, you still get fees. But --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So long as it's not an insubstantial claim.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So quite generous, with the government's money, of course. You know, it's quite different when we're talking about privat e litigants and non-federal. I think Congress might be more reticent to creating such a generous departure from even the prevailing party standard, but it could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And it hasn't here.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> End of case. That's your theory of the case?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's our theory.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. Got it.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I think, when the red light went on, you were in the middle of a really brilliant answer about Buckhannon. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And do you want to finish that answer?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Like a  --like a preliminary injunction, it was fleeting. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And I'm not sure that I recall the brilliance that was --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, I will look at the transcript and fill it in, so okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the  -- you know, I was just going to try to talk about strategic mootness maybe a little bit. Maybe that's where  we were going. And, you know --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Sure.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- strategic mootness, as my  -- my  --my colleague has already answered, you've got a voluntary cessation barrier, which, you know, in your decision in Fikre, Justice Gorsuch, it's a pretty formidable burden.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I hope so. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it -- it's a formidable burden. Damages awards, never going to moot out. And it's entirely speculative what effect this is going to have. That's what Buckhannon said. Like, it's not speculative whether it's going to deter counsel or not. And I think this illustrates that. There's no data to show this. This case was started when Smyth was the rule. They had no reason to expect any attorney's fees from a PI, but they took the case. So it's a little hard to say, like, there's this compelling case that, like, we're going to have a  -- a --a crash in civil rights, civil rights era. And there's a real cost, again, to determining  -- to deterring the government from changing course when the action might be lawful but bad policy.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. That's good enough. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So here's the problem that I'm having with your statement of the case as you summarized with Justice Gorsuch. It's that it begins with Sole says that a PI doesn't count because you have to look at what happens afterwards. I'm reading from Sole. ""We express no view on whether, in the absence of a final decision on the merits of a claim for permanent relief, success in gaining a preliminary injunction may sometimes warrant an award of counsel fees.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So I don't know how you can start your case with the premise that Sole stands for the proposition that if you win a preliminary injunction, you have to get to final judgment in order to be entitled to  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it's true  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- counsel fees.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --that the Court reserved that, but the Court also did say that it recognized that a preliminary injunction was just the initial salvo. As I stated in my intro, it's  -- the tentative character makes a fee request at that initial stage premature.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It did not say ""premature.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It says, ""Wyner is not a prevailing party, we conclude, for her initial victory was ephemeral.""  And it was ephemeral in that case because it happened to go on and get reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It's on page 84 of the Court's opinion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> ""The tentative  character would have made the fee request at this initial stage premature.""</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> ""The tentative character"" --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Of the PI.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- ""would have made"" -- yes, but it also says:  ""We express no view as to whether or not that tentative character in  PI is enough to make you a prevailing party.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Agreed, but I think it goes halfway there, and Buckhannon closes the door on that  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- because --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text>Mr. Schmalzbach.</text>"

Blatt</speaker><text> Thank you, and may it please the Court:  RICO states that any person injured in his business or property by reason of racketeering can sue therefor and recover threefold the damages he sustains. Because RICO's cause of action excludes personal injuries, RICO excludes damages resulting from personal injuries. The text differentiates the injury from racketeering and the damages sustained from that injury, thus showing that injury and damages are distinct. And the references to damages he sustains shows that damages are the losses suffere d as a result of the injury. Damages are not themselves the injury inflicted by the defendant. This distinction tracks this Court's recognition that lost wages and medical expenses are classic damages from personal injuries. Respondent's complaint alleges  the personal injury of unwanted ingestion of THC and the resulting damages of lost wages. To quote the complaint:  ""Defendant's behavior caused  Plaintiff's fiscal harm in the ingestion of Dixie, and as a direct result of consuming this  product, he was dismissed from his employment."" That's a personal injury claim outside civil RICO. Respondent argues that every economic loss is its own RICO injury but not to worry because RICO still bars non-pecuniary damages. But that view conflates injury and damages by treating RICO's exclusion of personal injuries as just excluding a narrow type of damages: pain and suffering and emotional distress. Respondent's rule also leaves the personal exclusion toothless since virtually all personal injuries result in monetary loss.

Personal injuries are serious and may support state tort -- tort claims, but they are not the stuff of RICO. I welcome questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> What does it mean to be injured, someone to be injured, in his business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> The Court  in -- in the Clayton Act case of Reiter talked about what -- injury to business, and it was referring to anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss, it would be both a right  -- a -- a injury to both business and property, a right to carry on business. Now the lower courts pre-RICO under the Clayton Act have also recognized that an employee has a business kind of a right to carry on in his employment, and we haven't contested that. So, in those cases, if you conspired to prevent  -- in those cases, they involved encyclopedic salesmen, deprived those people of their right to carry on their profession as a salesman, the -- the lower courts recognized that that was an injury to business. So it's a right to carry on, you know, a profession or your commercial enterprise.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Can loss of employment ever constitute a injury in business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, it's -- it certainly does in the Clayton Act. And the example I could think of, the only example that r eadily comes to mind, in RICO would be the human trafficking cases, where a person is forced to work against their will, and the -- there's an injury in your right to get, you know, the -- the payment for your performed work. So that would be an injury, a direct injury, to one's business. And that human trafficking  --it's hard to see how it would otherwis e come up unless you defrauded someone into quitting their job, but, generally, lost wages are pretty standard, prototypical damages from personal injury.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you're raising an example that leads me to think that what you're really arguing about is proximate cause, meaning -- and not really whether personal injury is recoverable or not. It is under, by your own admission, certain circumstances. And, in your brief, you list a bunch of examples that seem to me quintessential personal injuries, but you related them to the business loss and then said those were recoverable.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So personal --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So it doesn't make any sense to me to say a mob can threaten a store owner to take over his business and, if he doesn't, injure him and he can't recover, but if they put a bomb in the place and close it down, they close it down by hitting him or shooting him but then throw a bomb, he can recover for the bomb but not for the injury to himself.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So no one in  -- under this statute can ever recover for personal injuries, full stop, never ever. If there's an independent infringement  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But why?  Isn't --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of the right to property  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- isn't that an issue or shouldn't it be an issue of proximate cause, which wasn't reached in this case, correct?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, no, and here's why, because a lot of examples, the plaintiff will meet a direct and proximate cause, and I can start to give you a million, but they would  still be damages resulting from personal injury. Take your  -- a shooting where someone is shot and suffers medical expenses and can't work. Direct injury, sure, the lost wages and  medical expenses, but, still, it's damages resulting from personal injury, so a proximate cause --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But, no, there's a whole lot more to RICO than simply damages. There's also the predicate that you have to have a racketeering --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For sure.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- enterprise. You have to have willful intent. In product liability cases, most of those are negligence or strict liability, so you're not going to have willfulness or intent. And, similarly, you have to show proximate causation, reasonably foreseeable. There's a serious question as to whether you shoot someone not related to the enterprise and you cause damage, but another predicate act occurs that you're going to recover. --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, in your normal case of any personal injury, you read a -- misread --a label's confuse -- misleading, you're injured, you are  -- can't work, you have lost -- lost --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You're still not</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> That's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- you're still not answering my --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I guess what  -- so two things. You can always have causation, but there's still an independent requirement that you must be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> There has to be proximate causation  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes. And there's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- which is very different.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --plenty of proximate, direct, absolute causation, no ands, ifs, or buts, but it's still just a personal injury action that's outside the scope of RICO.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> You started by talking to Justice Thomas about what it means to be injured in your business or property. Now there  might be a set of questions there that this Court has not addressed, lower courts have, but  you said lower courts have said that to -- to lose a job is to be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. Sorry. To lose a job can be both damages or an injury. It depends on the na ture of the cause of action. So you always generally, with every personal injury, can have permanent job loss. You can have lost wages. Those are damages.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's also --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It is a very rare case  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's also a loss when  --you know, it's a -- it's a harm when I lose a job. You know, I've been harmed. I lost my job. And --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> When you pay medical expenses, you're harmed as well.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> If you're harmed when you lose a job, then you've been injured in your business, haven't you?  I mean, just as -- I -- I guess what I'm saying is the simplest, clearest reading of this statutory language is it doesn't -- it doesn't distinguish by what causes the harm. It  just says, if you're harmed in a way that's in your business or property, which has been understood to include being harmed by loss of a  job, and that's by reason of a violation of Section 1962, then you're entitled to threefold the damages you would otherwise be  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the problem with that is it's reading the statute just like the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Antiterrorism Act, to say any person injured in his person can recover threefold the damages. And the --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's not reading the statute the same way as injured in his person because, if  -- if all I come in and say is, you know, I suffered emotional distress or I suffered pain and suffering, I would not be entitled to damage  -- to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So that's an infinitesimal, small number of cases that would be excluded.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> It might be an infinitesimal, small number of cases. I'm just trying to figure out -- like, that's the most normal, natural reading of the statutory language. If you've been -- it doesn't say what  you've been injured by. I mean, you have to be injured by the RICO violation. But it doesn't  distinguish among different kinds of RICO violations. It just says, if you've been injured by a RICO violation in your business --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> In your business, right.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- which includes your employment, then you're entitled to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the only way to give the statute its normal meaning of ""damages sustained"" is to distinguish between the injury. If the Respondent had hit a tree because he was impaired from THC, that would be a classic personal injury action for lost wages and medical expenses. It sounds like you think maybe the Second Circuit is right. The Second Circuit seemed to think lost wages are always recoverable, but medical expenses never would be because that results from a physical injury. And, of course, property loss, the most fundamental of all property loss is monetary loss.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But I  --I think what  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> All personal injury actions result in monetary loss except, I guess, a case where there's just exclusively psychological damage. But every slip and fall  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, I -- I don't know exactly how your rule works because, if you don't read it that normal, straightforward way, then, you know, you  -- you get into all these -- you admit in a whole set of hypos that I can do something to you that we would normally classify as a personal injury and you would be entitled to RICO damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So, if I hit you and, as a resul t of that -- this is your car wash operator example -- there's an assault that's usually understood as a personal injury, but, as a result, you decide to do business with the mobster rather than with a legitimate businessman and you say, well, notwithstanding that it was all caused by an assault, which was a personal injury, you are entitled to RICO damages. And I think you could say the same thing here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's just not our argument.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, you could have  --you could have a proximate -- well, I don't know how you get to the answers of your hypotheticals if that's not your argument.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. Whenever you have a robbery where money is taken or an extortion where money is taken or kidnapping where ransom is taken, there are two independent infringements of your legal right. You have a right to not be hit or assaulted or whatever, you know, kidnapped, and you have a right not to have your money taken. And when money is taken, you get your money back under RICO because that's a monetary independent loss. You cannot recover for physical --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, money is taken as a result of the assault. The assault happens, and then you say:  Okay, I better do business with you. So, I mean, you're  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's why our test  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's a -- it's a consequential injury from the assault.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me give you an example. If you take the money and then shove the person down the stairs, you took the money. You may have shoved the person down the stairs to prevent them from getting their money back, but our test doesn't ask which --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But that's not your own hypos. Your own hypos are things like there's an assault, there's a kidnapping, there's a murder. All of those things are personal injuries that don't have any particular economic component. As a result of those things, you lose some business opportunities, and -- and you yourself say you get RICO under that  -- you get RICO damages under those hypotheticals. So this one  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You can --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- looks pretty much like that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. You can always get RICO damages for independent property violations. And, here, there is just an allege  of a right not to have -- not to be induced to consume THC. Our position is no different than the Clayton Act. It's the exact same rule. This Court, in the Truett versus Chrysler Motor Company case, said:  No damages resulting from personal injuries. That is our test.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. Blatt, can I  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you where you get your definition of ""legal injury""?  I mean, are you looking at just kind of general tort principles?  I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out exactly how you look at it and define it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Two -- two -- two places. So, when it says, you know, this RJR Nabisco and also just the statute, you can sue and you can  sue for a personal injury, that, to me, conjures up the infringement of a right. And in WesternGeco, when the Court talked about an infringement of the patent right, it called it ""the injury.""  In Yegiazaryan, when it talked about what the injury in that case was when trying to decide if there's a domestic injury, it talked about what the racketeering activity directly did to the plaintiff. And so injury as an infringement of a legal right is a -- I think we cite Ballentine, but that is a standard definition of ""injury.""</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Where does the ""legal"" in the ""legal right"" come from?  Are you looking kind of at general principles?  You're just looking at the nature of the harm?  Does it help you in terms of property or --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, I think it's just a question of federal law. I mean, so whether you have an injury to person, property, or business, that's a question of federal law that's informed by general tort principles.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So are you looking at, like, the Restatement?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You could in the Burke case that dealt with whether something was a  personal injury on  -- sorry, damages on account of personal injury. The Court looked at things like a Dobbs and Restatements, but it was a federal question on whether the damages resulted from the personal injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Why  --why aren't you looking  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and whether there was a per  -- whether  --whether discrimination under Title VII was, in fact, a personal injury or some other kind of injury. The Court looked at a bunch of state law sources, but it was a federal law question.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, I  -- I'm trying to understand the personal injury that you say was alleged or happened in this case. I did not perceive Mr. Horn to be relying on any sort of personal injury allegation with respect to the RICO count. He doesn't say, for example, that he took the THC and that he got ill from it and, as a result of that, he took off from work and then he got fired. He says, instead, just directly, that he  --let me see --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I think  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- alleges a pattern of mail and wire fraud related to your client's alleged fraud about whether the product took -- contained THC. He relied on that, and he got fired as a result. I don't see where personal injury is doing any work in his RICO claim.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think you're correct in the complaint that the allegations we're talking about, where he's talking about physical harm, it's talking about either the -- the allegations that are general. But page 21 of our brief goes into great detail of all the other places in his affidavit and in the RICO case statement  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah, but those are in other counts. Those are in the personal injury counts. And I think that matters, right?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, not in the RICO statement. The RICO statement, by definition, is the RICO claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm saying is the question presented in this case, that you've presented, is whether economic harms resulting from personal injuries are  injuries to business and property. So I'm trying to understand the allegation of personal injury here from which  the business harm results.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah, and I guess --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He doesn't say:  My injury is resulting from a personal injury. He says:  I'm injured because I got fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, his entire causation -- and, again, I'm not just quoting from the complaint. His affidavit  -- he needs to rely on the consumption or he doesn't have causation. Consumption is personal injury. But this was litigated at the cert stage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But does your test need to rely on the consumption?  I mean, suppose there was  --suppose the employer's rule.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think that's fair, you're right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So  -- but -- but that's why I'm sort of, with Justice Kagan, trying to understand your rule. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think our rule is, if there's no personal injury, we don't need to be here and have this discussion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm asking you -- let me ask you in a hypothetical.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> All right?  So suppose we have the same basic situation, but the employer's rule is that you can't possess --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- THC. Can't have it. And he looks at all of the advertising materials. He understands that your product does not have it based on your advertising materials, and so he buys it and he has it in his locker. I think this is an example  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that the Respondents came up with.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- because the -- the  --the employer says:  You have it. You're not supposed to have it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Does he have a RICO claim or not under those circumstances?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he doesn't have a RICO claim, but it wouldn't be covered by this case because there's no personal injury. It would be no different if he was  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. You're inserting personal injury. What I'm suggesting --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Your example doesn't involve a personal injury. Now, at most -- if I can just answer the direct question. If I was that person's lawyer, I would say:  You were injured in your business or property for the purchase price. You paid  --purchase price is a classic RICO injury, classic Clayton Act. He's entitled to three times his purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So you're saying he would have a RICO claim in --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He would  -- okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But lost wages aren't -- he doesn't rely on the law  -- he --and he would fail any kind of causation test if he tried to say:  I was f ired from the purchase price. He would ultimately fail causation under three of your Supreme Court cases that say there has to be a direct relationship between the conduc t that was done to the plaintiff and the lost claim. And there, you had the independent actor of the employer. It would be no different if the employer fired him for bei ng tricked into buying baby powder that, you know, didn't have the requisite -- it might -- he might have an injury, but he just wouldn't have a RICO claim because there would be lack of causation.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and isn't that essentially what's wrong with this case too, is what Justice Sotomayor was suggesting?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It does --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, there is a definite causation problem in this case.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> His -- his -- you know, he buys this thing. He ingests this  thing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And someone else fired him.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> A different person fires him. This is not a good RICO claim for that reason, but it has nothing to do with the reason that you're  giving.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, no, no, no, no. You can win for more than one reason, Justice Kagan. The Second Circuit held that a --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you're relying on an intuition that your client should win and Ms. Anand should lose. And that intuition may be a very valid one and  -- but the -- but the intuition works because there's no  proximate cause.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But all -- with all --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> The intuition does not work because he hasn't satisfied the business or property requirement because he has. He's been injured in his person or property --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, and with all due respect  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- by reason of a RICO violation.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- with all due respect, every classic slip-and-fall personal injury case, you could talk about causation clearly,  but it would still be the lost wages, you're fired because you either can't work because you're permanently disabled, or your employer fires you because you can no longer see or have an arm.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, maybe there's  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You still lose your job, but it's  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- maybe there's also an issue  --I mean, we haven't -- we haven't decided what this ""business or property"" phrase means. Maybe ""business or property""  doesn't mean lost wages. But, again, it -- that's a -- that's a second reason why you might win but also a reason that has nothing to do with the reason that you're articulating here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Just  -- Justice Kagan, the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit hold, if  you have a personal injury, and what the other side reads the statute to say anybody injured in his person, have at it under RICO; just don't assert economic damages. That flips the statute on its head. It doesn't say anything about being injured in your person. And, under their rule, all personal injuries are recoverable under RICO, which is an absurd not just intuitive proposition, but that cannot be within the contemplation --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Can I pick up --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of Congress.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- on Justice Barrett's question?  Because I think the other side says that injury, just ordinary meaning, means harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And you say that's wrong based on an idea that ""injury"" is a term of art, I think --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- in tort law. Can you elaborate on why injury does not equal harm?  Because that's --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- front and center in their brief.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- so I think injury could mean harm just as it means the -- the legal harm that was invaded. So I don't have a problem with the word ""harm.""  But what it doesn't mean  is loss in terms of any damage. And they have no meaning or independent distinction between ""injury"" and ""damages sustained.""  And I think inherent in that distinction between the injury that -- the injury that you sue over is the type of infringement. And you have to have  -- look, everyone agrees at least I think since you've said it twice under Clayton Act and RICO that the cause of action excludes personal injuries. So what does that mean?  We think it means what it says. It excludes personal injuries. So that means the damages from personal injuries. They say no, no, no, it includes personal injuries and it includes all damages from personal injuries.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why is this a damage from personal injury?  That's the part I don't understand. He's not claiming that he got  ill because of the product. He's not saying he was personally injured. He didn't even know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that he had ingested THC until the testing and the firing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Isn't that where his injury comes in?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think -- I mean, this was the  --this was what  the other side briefed to the Second Circuit and the Second Circuit didn't decide it. But, if I ate poppyseed bagels and failed a drug test, it's a personal injury. If I took a medicine like doxycycline, which is an antibiotic, and I can't be out in the sun and I lose my job as a lifeguard, it's a personal injury claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why are you saying that?  You can -- I mean, you're just saying that. I'm asking you, you know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Why am I saying it?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- there are -- there are personal injury claims that derive  from a person being harmed by -- by the ingestion of the product, right?  They're bodily, physically harmed because they have taken this thing. I don't read this claim to be that kind of injury. He's not saying that the  product itself injured him in any way.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think it is inconsistent with all of tort law to say a bodily invasion is not a personal injury just because you didn't have to go to the hospital or cough.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He voluntarily took the product.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, we all do.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He was not invaded. He  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> We all take products that can be mislabeled. We take them and we either get sick or we don't. But we all take products and we claim, yeah, but the label told me I wasn't going to have a side effect  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and I had the side effect.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- Ms. Blatt, if I might ask you a different question. You rely  heavily on the Clayton Act and -- and the similar language there. I went and looked at the Areeda -Hovenkamp, what they have to say about this.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, dear.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I know. I know. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah. ""Oh, dear"" is right. They say:  Reiter thus made plain that the business-or-property requirement is virtually always satisfied provided there's some kind  of injury that can properly be characterized as economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Well, I don't -- I mean, that's not right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I would go -- no.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- you just disagree with Areeda  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, yeah. No, that's definitely wro ng.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. Okay. Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely. And  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That' s all I need to know. Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. No. Wrong, wrong, wrong. And Reiter, I think, I mean, says  anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss it's going to be a business or injury. But let's  -- look, there are Clayton Act cases after Clayton  -- any -- any conspiracy to affect drug prices that result in a personal injury would mean treble damages under Clayton Act. That would be a sea change -- a sea change in Clayton Act if you had personal injury recovery for price-fixing.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So even Homer nods, the great Areeda and Hovenkamp treatise wrong?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely, because you would -- you would -- that would be, like I said, a sea change under Clayton Act. I mean, it might be a boondoggle for plaintiffs' lawyers, but I think it would freak everyone else out.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, aren't you estopped from claiming that he has a personal injury here when below you argued or  your client argued that he had no personal injury, which is why all the personal injury claims were dismissed?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I don't understand how you can have it both ways.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. On page 113 of the Pet. App., the district court is recognizing that we argued, and the court said, there's no cognizable injury. But, on pages 49 and 50, which I think is pretty bad for the other side, the court is saying but there's clearly a -- this is a classic personal injury claim, which is why he can get lost wages for fraud.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. I'm talking about what you argued. Your client argued, to get rid of the personal injury claims, that he had no personal injury; the only thing was economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So -- so --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And so now that he's left with the economic, you say no, there is a personal injury and he can't get damages for that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Sorry. On pages 49 and 50, it goes through how we, the defendants, are arguing th is is a personal injury claim. So we did argue it was a personal injury claim. We  claimed what we're talking about before, there's no cognizable personal injury. It's like saying  emotional damage, it's not -- it doesn't count because you didn't have  --it didn't manifest itself in physical. So I don't think we're estopped. If you want to let that, I guess, I don't know, reverse, you'd have to reverse the rule and then decide if we're estopped, but I don't -- I'm not sure how that would work out if that's what you thought.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Do you want to respond to their invocation of the liberal construction canon?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes, a couple responses. I mean, liberal construction in light of its remedial purposes, but the one thing all nine of you should agree on, its remedial purposes did not extend to personal injuries. You've already said that twice, in the Clayton Act and in RJR Nabisco. It doesn't extend to remediate personal injury. Second of all, I think it's a tie-breaker. Their  -- their serious reading of the statute inserts the word ""injured in its person"" to read just like the Antiterrorism Act. And, finally, I think it does run up against the constitutional principle of federalism, that their view does cannibalize all of state tort law. Every -- every slip and fall from a mislabel now is a RICO case. So I think, I mean, that should be  -- the Court -- I mean, one more thing I'll try on that, the Court last cited that clause in 1985. I mean, it hasn't relied on it since and says you shouldn't use it to put RICO in contexts that Congress, you know, didn't want or couldn't have contemplated. And, here, it is just so  -- would be so striking to think that RICO remedied personal injuries.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say that under RICO, injury is ""the invasion of a legal right.""  So how would we go about determining  whether something is a legal right for this purpose?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, first, you look at the complaint. I think property's pretty easy because the Court has already said any monetary  loss is a property loss. So, I mean, you could quibble about whether loss of consortium, if state law defines that as a property loss. And then injury is also, I think, pretty easy  because that involves the body.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, what authorities would we look at?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh. Look at the complaint. Look at state law general tort principles. Again, that Burke case  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> General tort principles?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. What Burke said is -- which I like because it -- I think it works -- is that are the damages -- what are the damages seeking to redress?  Are the damages redressing a  --something that happened to the body, are they redressing stolen property, or  are they redressing a right to carry on in your business?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you rely a lot on WesternGeco. You mentioned it a  few minutes ago.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you ignore its language where they differentiate a patent case where the legal right is the right not to be infringed and where you feel the economic loss is different. And we said there that the Patent Act was different from civil RICO because the question in civil RICO is where the plaintiff feels the injury, in other words, where he suffers the economic harm that the damages compensate. So why should we think -- in -- in Sedima, we were very, very clear that RICO doesn't rely on state law -- state tort law concepts. We said that explicitly. What we  said was that RICO complicates injuries to have been caused by predicate acts. That's our --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and we explicitly -- explicitly say:  Not otherwise an  injury cognizable under state tort law.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's even better for me because our position is you shouldn't -- you can't get recovery that's -- that's caused by personal injury, which I think this case is. But, on RJR Nabisco -- sorry, the WesternGeco citing RJR Nabisco, I didn't --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that goes back to what Justice Jackson and  -- and what I tried earlier and Justice Kagan point out:  You're trying to say there's a difference between the two. But we've made very clear in WesternGeco there isn't. Injury is where you feel the harm. Now the question is:  What's the harm?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yegiazaryan said the opposite. Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as Justice Jackson said, the harm is not ingesting the drugs. That's the personal injury. The harm is from being fired. And whether there's a connection between the predicate acts and that harm  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- is a question of proximate cause, not a question of personal injury.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan is the most recent case where you said the injury was -- the inability to collect the California judgment was a domestic injury. You did not say it was the injury where all the effects were felt, which were a million different places  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that has nothing to do with the language of RICO -- of RICO, which says --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It was the language of</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- compensable injuries are the harms caused by predicate acts. And that's what we said in WesternGeco.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It's where you feel the harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan quotes that exact same language, and I think it's talk -- it begs the question about what is the harm talking about. Is it the harm that's the legal invasion of the right, or is it the damages at the end of the day?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask you about a hypo?  Because I'm still trying to understand your rule. You seem to be suggesting that the mere existence of physical harm renders any business injury not compensable. Is that  -- is that the  --do I have the sum total of your --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No?  Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because you just said --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So what is your rule?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --you just -- because you just said it's any personal injury renders the -- 40 damages  not recoverable. Obviously, if you have a business injury, a property injury, you can recover damages.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even if you have a physical injury too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely, because that's the example of a robbery. If you are thrown down a flight of stairs and they take your wallet, you have two injuries. You fell down the stairs and you lost your wallet.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You've got -- so you have a property injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- and a personal injury</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --two independent invasions.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and so, here, you say he took the drugs and that was an injury. And he says:  I was also fired. Why isn't that  two injuries too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because every  -- you would -- because -- because that conflates damages. Every personal injury, you could say I slip and fell --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But this is -- imagine that this is not damages in the following sense, all right?  If we have a case  in which he takes the drugs --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and, as a result of taking the drugs, he has to go to  the hospital, and, as a result of being in the hospital, he can't work.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I kind of understand the argument you're making. But, in this situation, he takes the drugs and there is no harm --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to him from taking the drugs.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me leave you with one more example. He goes to the hospital and he loses his sight and he can't drive anymore, so he gets fired. He still has a loss of employment. It is a damage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. But that's not this case. Nothing happened to him as a result of taking the drugs. Instead, what happened to him, I think -- and this is -- maybe I'm just not understanding.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he failed a drug test. It changed his -- well, allegedly, it had THC in it. I think it's the same thing as if you took something and had an allergic reaction. It's a physical, chemical, bodily invasion. He didn't want  -- he didn't want THC and he took it. It's like taking cocaine. That's a  -- to me, that's a physical injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- whether or not you hid something.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anand.</text>","<speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  I want to address two quick points. The first is about the ""damages sustained"" locution in Section 1964(c). That means  compensatory damages. We know that from the rest of the U.S. Code, the syntax of the sentence, and the plain meaning of the word ""damages.""  So rest of  the U.S. Code, that locution, ""damages sustained,"" appears some three dozen times in the U.S. Code. It always means compensatory damages. So we point you to the example of 18 U.S.C. 2255, where victims of crime choose between liquidated damages and damages sustained. You can't choose between liquidated damages and harm. Those have to be two measures of compensation. Syntax of the rest of the sentence. The sentence says:  Recover the damages sustained. If it meant harm, you would expect it to say ""recover for the damages sustained."" You recover for harm. You don't recover the harm. But, if it means compensatory damages, that's a perfectly sensible sentence. And, finally, the plain meaning of ""damages.""  Every dictionary will tell you  damages is a measure of compensation, including the treatise that Petitioners cite at page 15 of their opening brief. So, absent that textual hook, the other problem with Petitioners' rule is they  still have not told you how to distinguish the human trafficking case from this case. Here are some of the things I heard my friend say:  Look at the Restatement. Well, we think the relevant Restatement principle is Section 525, the fraudulent misrepresentation tort. That's the only state law tort that survived to trial, right?  It's not a product liability claim. It's an economic tort, fraudulent misrepresentation. She said:  Look to a legal right. Well, Sedima tells us that the legal right protected by RICO is the right not to be harmed by reason of the predicate acts. She said:  Look at whether money was taken. This isn't a forfeiture or a unjust enrichment statute, right?  It's not worded that way. She said:  Look to directness. As Justice Kagan explained, that's a proximate cause problem. We recognize we have a heavy burden on remand, but that's not the argument before you. And she said:  Look at what is trying to be redressed. Here, we're trying to redress the loss of income from being fired. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  I want to address two quick points.

Here, we're trying to redress the loss of income from being fired. I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Is the loss of income from being fired an injury in business?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Yes, Your Honor. And I believe my friend on the other side conceded that. She said inability to carry on one's livelihood is an injury to business.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> And is -- what's the difference between injury and damages?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So injury is the harm. Damages is how you compensate for that harm. And, again, I think that's a perfectly sensible reading of the statute.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> So, if the harm is a loss of income, aren't you collapsing or conflating the two?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So it's true that we use the term ""lost wages"" as shorthand for both. But, in one case, you are losing your source of income. Lost wa ges is the measure of compensation you need to make yourself whole. And, again, that ""damages"" definition, damages is compensation, that's the definition that every legal dictionary or treatise articulates.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Okay. So just walk me through factually what is the injury here.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So the injury here is we were fired. That's the injury to our business. Now, as a measure of compensation for that, the damages we claim are an amount equal to the salary we would have made and the other economic benefits we would have gotten had we remained employed.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But Medical Marijuana did not fire you.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So, again, Your Honor, we accept that on remand we will have to meet the kind of heavy factual burden of showing proximate cause, but that's the home for the problem Your Honor is articulating:  how direct  is the link between the predicate acts and what happened here. And, in this case, you know, our argument is we acted in reasonable reliance on Medical Marijuana's misrepresentations that the classic, right, Restatement 525, the pecuniary  loss occasioned as a result of relying on a fraudulent misrepresentation, is usually  actionable. We think we can prove proximate cause, but, again, that's a question for remand, not for this Court.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Counsel, I understood the business-or-property limitation as having been intended to be a significant limitation on the reach of RICO. Your friend said that your position would make every slip and fall a RICO violation. Why isn't that the case?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So two reasons, Your Honor. The first is sort of empirical. We can look at, for instance, the evidence from the Ninth Circuit, which has had this rule for 20 years, and, as we explain in our -- in our brief, you have substantially fewer civ il RICO complaints than you'd expect. And that's because the ""injured in his business or property"" requirement is still doing  something really important, which is fencing out any claim that the harm I suffered is pain and suffering or emotional distress. Those are the  sort of lion's share of recoveries in most of these tort cases, right?  This is the reason that plaintiffs' lawyers bring these cases, are for those massive recoveries. The second  --sorry. Does that  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> No, no, go -- go ahead.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> The sort of second point I'll  --I'll make on that front is, you know, RICO has a number of guardrails. In your average slip-and-fall case, you're not going to be able to prove a predicate act, let alone a pattern of predicate acts, let alone a pattern carried  on through a racketeering enterprise.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, but, I mean, those guardrails are addressing different things. I mean, the business-or-property requirement is pretty central to the heart of  RICO and what separates it from all these other cases. So I'm not sure it's very responsive to say, oh, don't worry about that basic, fundamental question because there are all these  other more subsidiary ones that are going to take care of the problem.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So I think that's -- I think that's right, that it's still  -- it's doing meaningful work because, again, it fences out the sort of pain and  suffering, emotional distress, the kind of lion's share of the recoveries. You know, as Justice Gorsuch noted and as lower courts have kind of grappled with, it turns out that Congress maybe wasn't doing quite as much work as it wanted to with this guardrail. We know that from the antitrust context, where it's virtually always satisfied. But, as this Court has said time and --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> You mean  --by ""this guardrail,"" you mean the business-or-property restriction?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Yes. As Justice Gorsuch noted, in the antitrust context, it's virtually always satisfied. And what this Court has said time and again, right, that's Sedima, that's  Bridge, that's Turkette, Congress may have written the statute too broadly, but that's a problem for Congress to have its say.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Do you agree that the statute excludes damages for personal injuries?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So, yes, I agree that if the injury you suffered  is an injury to your body, you can't claim damages for that.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And I think what the other side is saying, that the damages for personal injuries are usually including lost wages and medical expenses and that what you're doing, even though you just admitted that the statute excludes damages for personal injuries, is taking lost wages and medical expenses and saying, oh, well, we can get around that limitation that the Chief Justice referred to by characterizing the lost wages or medical expenses as separate injuries to your business or property. That's the concern. I'm curious, your response.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So I do think lost wages are an injury to business. And my friend on the other side said --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> But they're also damages for the personal injury  --</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So yes --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- in some of these cases.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And the question is whether -- I think the question and the problem here that we have to figure out is, when you characterize them, if they are damages from personal injury, can you just recharacterize them as injury to business or property and get around, as the Chief Justice's point, the limitation that Congress at least thought was important?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So I think that when Congress wants to exclude something that is intertwined with a personal injury, it knows how to do so, right?  It can exclude -- there's lots of statutes, we give examples in our brief, where it says you cannot recover damages on account of a personal injury. That is, if -- there's a personal injury intertwined with the business injury or in the chain of causation leading up to the business injury, you are out of  luck. Congress didn't do that here. Congress just said find an injury to business -- and we think being fired is a classic injury to business; you can no longer carry out your livelihood -- and that's all you need to get to</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> But that would mean, I think you're saying -- okay -- I think you're saying yes, the damages from personal injuries can be characterized as injuries to business or property. Therefore, you can just bring them under RICO. That would mean that every state tort personal injury suit in which you're seeking lost wages or medical expenses can be now brought on -- under RICO and seek treble damages. And I would think the federalism canon, among several others, would kick in there and say, well, that would be a dramatic, really radical shift in how tort suits are  --are brought throughout the United States, and we would expect a clearer indication from Congress.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Sure, Your Honor. So two responses on that front. The first is I think it's a mistake to think that most state garden-variety torts can form the basis of a RICO claim. There's a reason why most product liability cases are brought in strict liability or negligence. There's a reason why the pattern --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> There are going to be a lot of false advertising kind of cases, inadequate warning cases that can easily be made into a RICO predicate than can, under your theory, be brought in federal court under RICO for treble damages and then  -- you know, you've seen it in the amicus briefs, I'm just raising what's there  --class actions and MDLs, where you have the treble damages. And that's a dramatic  --I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but I think it's a dramatic shift -- and the Ninth Circuit doesn't have exactly the rule you're asking for, so I don't think the Ninth Circuit's actually a good answer to the Chief Justice  -- a dramatic shift in how tort suits are prosecuted, which may be good, may not be good. I'm not sure Congress really put that into this statute.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Sure. So just on the federalism canon point, I'll note that if Your Honor is right that every state false advertising case actually can be actionable as  intentional fraud committed through a racketeering enterprise, that means that under criminal RICO -- remember, does not have an  injured in its business or property requirement  -- those are prosecutable with a 20-year sentence. And so, if Congress did not have any federalism concerns with subjecting the garden -variety state tortfeasor to criminal -- federal criminal liability, I think it's hard to say the federalism canon kicks in when they're subjected to civil liability.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, they  -- they didn't -- I think the lack of the language in the criminal RICO provision shows that they were more concerned about federalizing the civil RICO side because, there, they did have the limitation, injured in your business or property, not injured in your person.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So maybe two  -- two more responses let me try to  --to Your Honor's hypothetical. The first is the word ""injured,"" if it doesn't mean harm, my friend on the other side haven't  --hasn't told you what else it might mean. And  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, the Restatement  -- I'm sorry to interrupt.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Oh, please.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> But your brief starts with injured equals harm.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> It's right on page 1, like, fifth line, and that's the linchpin of your argument, which I think, as a matter of ordinary meaning, yes, but, as a matter of tort law, the Restatement makes very clear, like Restatement 7 says injury and harm contrasted.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> That's right.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> They're two  -- they're two different concepts and have been for years and decades and centuries in tort law. Injury and harm are two very different concepts.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So that's right, injury can mean invasion of a legal right, but, here, that's trivially true, right?  That's the square holding of Sedima. In Sedima, someone tried to  come to this Court and say, look, it can't just be an injury meaning you were harmed by the predicate acts. There's got to be some sort of racketeering injury. That's the legal right being invaded. And this Court said, ""The  compensable injury necessarily is the harm caused by the predicate acts.""  So we're happy with a definition that says invasion of a legal right, but Sedima tells you what that legal right is, and it is harm caused by the predicate acts. The right that RICO protects is the right not to be harmed by the predicate acts. And so I think whether you say injury just means harm, period, or it means an invasion of a legal right, there's no way on the text of the statute to somehow distinguish between the human trafficking and kidnapping hypotheticals and  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Just to close it out, you're okay if we say injury is the invasion of legal right?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> We're  --we are completely okay with that so long as you accept that Sedima tells you what that legal right looks like.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Ms. Anand, just a couple quick questions. First, in your dialogue with Justice Kavanaugh, there was some discussion of lost wages and medical expenses. Do you think medical expenses are recoverable as well as lost wages under business  and property?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So I happen to think yes, and I think that follows from Rotella and Reiter. But we don't particularly have a  dog in that fight because that's under the property branch and not the business branch. So I'm happy to explain why I think the answer is yes. Reiter seems to say --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Briefly, but I -- it seems to me you're telling me we don't need to decide that question in this case, is your top-line answer.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Top -line answer is you don't need to decide that question. The way you know that is the Second Circuit, Pet. App. 18a, Judge Moore's dissent in Jackson, all these jurists who have accepted our rule have reserved the question of medical expenses --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> -- as just a separate question.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And would you  -- would you encourage us to do so here?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> No, I would not urge you to do so.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> You encourage us to decide it, of course. Okay. So, briefly, give me your best shot at it.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So -- okay. So --so, on the precedent piece, Reiter/Clayton Act context says economic expenditure equals injury.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> And Rotella Petitioners seem to accept at Reply Brief page 8, right? This is the case doctors wrongly impose psychiatric confinement and then bill someone for it, and Petitioners seem to accept that that bill counts as a harm to property.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. All right. And the second question:  There was an extensive dialogue about the car wash hypothetical and the kidnapping hypothetical, and if I understood Ms. Blatt, her argument, it goes something like this:  that there are two injuries, however characterized, whether as a harm or an invasion  of a legal right. One is the assault or the kidnapping. The other is the act of extortion. And only the latter is recoverable, and it isn't a causation question so much as the nature of the injury in those two cases. Your best response?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> I think, under that framework, we also have two injuries, right? There's the bodily invasion, the sort of undetected consumption of THC --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> No, no, the --</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> -- and then the firing.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Deal -- I understand that, but deal with  the hypotheticals if you will.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So I  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> You both  -- you both go back and forth forever on these hypotheticals, and they're very interesting ones, so  --</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Sure. So I -- I agree the car  wash owner gets to recover, and I would say that is because the only thing you're looking at in the ""injured in his business or property"" requirement is, was the person harmed in his business?  And the answer is yes. Now there are other parts of the statute that take care of how direct is the connection between the predicate offense and the injury to business. That's the ""by reason of""  language. That's the proximate cause test.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So the assault, if I understand your answer if I  -- see if this is right. I just want to understand it.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Sure.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That the assault in -- in the car wash hypothetical and the kid -- act of kidnapping in the kidnapping hypothetical may or may not be recoverable depending upon whether they're proximately related to the extortion acts in both cases?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> I think that's right. So the  -- the only part that's recoverable is the money or business part. And the only  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> The extortion.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> The extortion part that I paid money --</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Or -- or the ransom in the kidnapping hypothetical.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And the ransom. Right.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> And the only question is, are those proximately caused by the RICO predicate of the kidnapping or the extortion?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> And, you know, I think, in those cases, right, the causal connection may be tighter, but, again, right, that's, again, classic proximate cause. Congress connected predicate act with injury to business and property using the phrase ""by reason of.""</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Got it.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> It anticipated some link to the cause.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Can I ask one --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If we  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Anand  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If we agree with your reasoning but reserve the question of the coverage of medical expenses, would there, in  a later case, be a principled basis for drawing that distinction, or would we be effectively deciding that by agreeing with your reasoning?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So, again, I think the answer is that those count, but I can tell you what lower courts have sort of said to distinguish those. There's been kind of two explanations. One is that Reiter's ""all money counts as property"" definition doesn't map on cleanly to civil RICO. And the other is that there's sort of a common law principle that mitigation measures don't count. And so, if you're trying to mitigate your pain and suffering through medical expenses, that wouldn't count. Now, again, I'm not -- we have no dog in that fight. I don't know whether those are right or wrong. And, again, I think Rotella kind of already crosses that bridge, but I think you can reserve the question here.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> One other question. There's been talk about proximate cause. I assume you believe on remand you can show that the injury here, the lost wages, were proximately caused. Could you explain why?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Sure, Your Honor. So I think our -- the two best points for us. The first is how the Restatement provision talks about fraudulent misrepresentation, and it says:  Any pecuniary loss occasioned by reasonable reliance on the  misrepresentation is usually recoverable. And so we think, here, that's exactly what happened. In reasonable reliance on Petitioners' misrepresentation, we took this drug. The foreseeable consequence is that we got fired. The second is a sort of factual point. Remember, it's not just about general misrepresentations on YouTube and on the website. Ms. Harp-Horn called Customer Service, says:  I'm a trucker. Can you promise me this doesn't have THC?  And they say:  Yes. Now, again, we know we're going to have a heavy burden on remand. This Court's cases have said that proximate cause is not just a common law concept, but you layer on top of that specific civil RICO directness requirements.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Is this a jury question?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> The question of proximate cause?  We think there are factual issues embedded in the proximate cause question.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> What percentage of  --</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> But, again -- apologies.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> What percentage of RICO cases go to trial?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> I don't know the answer to that off the top of my head, Justice Alito. I will say that on this point, Petitioners' proximate cause arguments at summary judgment related primarily to Ms. Harp-Horn and not to Mr. Horn. So, in other words, had they made the argument that Justice Kagan articulated, we don't know how the district court would have ruled. They did not make that argument.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Anand, it seems to me -- and  --and, you know, I just would like to get your take on this -- that Medical Marijuana has litigated this case differently than it was framed below and differently than the circuits that are on its side of the split in this definition of ""injury.""  You know, the  Second Circuit said:  Well, if personal injury is the derivative of the property damage, it doesn't count. As you said and as Justice Kagan said when she was going back and forth with Ms. Blatt, proximate cause seems a natural home for this. I mean, what do you think?  I mean, can you point to developed ideas in the courts of appeals about how to define this injury? This idea of looking to a federal definition  of it, looking to Restatements, I mean, in your view, are there circuits that are actually doing that?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So I don't think so, Your Honor, and I think you can see that in the question presented, which asks:  When economic harm results from a personal injury, is it actionable?  Right?  So the -- the question presented seems to contemplate this sort of chain -of-causation test, which, as we're sort of talking about, I think proximate cause and not some sort of per se rule about what the links are should count. I don't see that there's a body of case law doing something different in the -- in the  --in the lower courts.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So, in your view, Medical Marijuana's theory of the case is kind of novel?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> I think Medical Marijuana's theory of the case is novel, although I guess I  -- I would say again I'm not sure I understand it. That is, I'm not sure I understand where they're asking you to look to find the legal right. It's not civil RICO because Sedima tells us we can't do that. I don't think it's state tort law because it would be a little bit strange to have a list of predicates that includes trafficking in nuclear weapons and counterfeit phonograph records and say, look at the Restatement. And if you look at the Restatement in this case, the only state tort law claim that's still live in our case, fraudulent misrepresentat ion, looks economic and not personal. So I'm not positive what their test is, but I agree that it is not something th at we've seen in the lower courts.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> I share your confusion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Anand, did your client suffer a personal injury that caused his firing and lost wages?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So we think that he did not suffer any harm to his person. And we are not here challenging the district court's ruling that we cannot even bring a products liability claim because we did not suffer harm. Does that answer your question?  So, in other words  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah, I mean, I think so. I guess I'm -- I'm still struggling with the question presented in this case --</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- which assumes that sort of connection, that there's a personal injury from which economic damages result. And I don't see a personal injury, and maybe I'm just looking it in a peculiar way.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Well, so we -- we vociferously argued at the brief-in-opposition stage that this is an improper vehicle to grant  cert because we did not think there was a personal injury here. Or, at the very least,  the personal injury here is so strange, right, the personal injury that only gets discovered after the economic injury, that it would be a strange case to connect those overall.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And, in fact, below, they argued there was no personal injury  --</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> That's right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- in seeking to dismiss all of the personal injury claims, correct?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> That's exactly right. And none of those claims are proceeding to trial. So they successfully argued for dismissal of those claims.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Well, why wouldn't there be a personal injury, though?  Just -- you  -- there's a failure to warn that this product contains ingredients that your -- your  --your client didn't know about and should have known about and had a right to know about. I would have thought that that would have been kind of a classic personal injury.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So two responses, Your Honor. The first is --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I mean, perhaps -- perhaps that's what you argued below. I don't know.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> That is what -- so I was going to say the strange thing about how this case comes to you, right, is  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> No, I understand. But this is  -- this --that was your theory below?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> That  --that was our theory below  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> --that we should be able to bring a state law products liability claim. Opposing counsel said:  No, you can't. District court sided with them.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Got it. Got it. Thank you.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> It's what the  --the only other thing I'll say is, kind of going back to the hypothetical earlier, we just don't think that ingestion is particularly critical to our case. In other words, we would bring  exactly the same case, we would allege exactly the same predicate acts, the same measure of  compensation, the same sort of theory of harm, if the Medical -- if Medical Marijuana's product had been found in a locker and we'd been fired as a result.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. A big part of your answer in your dialogue with Justice Scalia to why this  -- why we shouldn't worry about the expansion of RICO that your -- your friend suggests might follow is that you have to show proximate cause. And I -- I don't quite remember your formulation. I'm sure it was carefully guarded. But you  -- you --you suggested that that w as going to be hard to do, right?  Tell me again why that is.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So -- so I said we would have a heavy factual burden to carry on remand.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> That sounds hard.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> But I think that if we can prove that, in fact, you know, there was reasonable reliance on this misrepresentation and, more specifically, that Ms. Harp-Horn called Customer Service, said, you know, I'm a trucker, promise me this does have zero percent THC, I think that satisfies proximate cause even under this Court's more restrictive test. But we accept we're going to have to prove those  things up.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, what's so hard about that?  In other words, if you're concerned about the reach of your argument and your  answer is, don't worry, we have to show proximate cause, that seems like a pretty normal proximate cause argument.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So -- so apologies. My answer isn't just proximate cause. It's also you have to show RICO predicates, right?  Most products liability are --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Yeah, fraud, mail fraud.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> -- strict liability, right?</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> But, again, that's intentional. And there's a reason why most  people bring product liability claims under strict liability or negligence. You're also  going to have to prove a pattern, right, continuity and relatedness. You have to prove the enterprise requirement. And I think, most importantly, again, the mine-run of cases, the big chunk of recovery is pain and suffering or economic distress, and you cannot got those in  --under civil RICO, right?  Those are not injuries to business or property. And I think that the --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, again, you're talking about these other guardrails, not to worry about the fact that you're diluting the business-or-property requirement.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So I  -- I disagree that we're diluting the business-or-property requirement. We think that lost employment is a classic business injury. Now the relationship between the lost employment and the predicate acts, you know, Congre ss put ""by reason of"" in there. It didn't put a more stringent test. It didn't say, you know, in the course of the predicate act you have to injure a business or property. It didn't -- you know, it didn't have a motive or a targeting requirement. And we think that the plain import of that, as this Court has held in Holmes and from there on, is, if you have a predicate act, you  have a loss of livelihood, and the -- the work to do is to connect those with the prox imate cause requirement.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, just out  of curiosity, why do you think you're going to face a heavy burden on remand to show foreseeability? Wouldn't you argue that a company that advertises its product as being completely free of THC, not just that it has only such an infinitesimal amount that it's not going to get people high, but it is completely free of T HC, is appealing to a category of potential customers who, for some reason, want to make sure that they don't ingest even a tiny, tiny amount of -- of THC? And when someone who purchases the product then suffers the consequences of having a very small amount of THC in that person's system, that is an entirely foreseeable result?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So I agree, Justice Alito.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> I was just responding to Justice Kagan's point that, in many cases, the  intervening act of a third party does cut off the chain of custody  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Yeah, I know.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> --but for exactly the reason --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> You're -- you're trying to tell us that the proximate  -- among other things, you have other arguments, but the proximate cause requirement is going to do some of the work that some of us might fear will be needed if we agree with your interpretation of ""injury to business or property.""  I get it. But I'm not sure why they're -- why your case is a  -- is a good example of that.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Sure. I think that's right. I was responding only to Justice Kagan's concern about the third-party actor, but, you know, we agree, we think we're going to meet the proximate cause test. I just want to say so my bottom-line position here is defendants have come to this Court for decades and said the sky is going to fall if you interpret RICO the way its text literally says it should be interpreted. The sky hasn't fallen. This Court has, time after  time, including unanimously in Bridge, said, you know, Congress probably wrote a statute that's a little too broad in some ways, but here we are. And it should stay the course here. That's my fundamental position.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, I think you're -- are you overstating your argument?  If we look back at everything that the Court has done in civil RICO cases, I -- I certainly don't think the Court has consistently applied the  -- the liberal construction policy or just relied on the plain language of the statute. RICO is a  -- RICO is a tough thing to deal with.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> I think that's right, but I think that's because of things in the statute, like the enterprise requirement, right?  It's  not just someone commits a predicate act; they have to use an enterprise to do it or fund an enterprise through doing so. It's because the  predicate acts often require sort of higher degrees of proof. There's lots of reasons in  the text why RICO --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> -- is challenging.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?  Justice Kagan? Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> A couple questions. The -- the larger issue afoot from the amicus briefs, of course, is the class action MDL, that state tort suits are going to be converted into civil RICO because you can get treble damages, and this is going to be a bit of a change. On that, one thing you've stressed is proximate cause. When  -- of course, in those types of suits -- and you can respond whether you think that's correct or not, that factual -- prediction. But, in those kinds of suits, of  course, getting past the motion to dismiss, getting past summary judgment is the key. When would proximate cause be resolved?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So I think some of those can be resolved early on, right?  In most cases,  it's not going to be the case that firing is the obvious consequence of whatever mislabeling happened, right?  And so I think fairly early on</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> But you're saying in this case  --</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Well, because of what Justice Alito explained, right?  The only reason to market this as having zero percent THC, right -- there are a couple reasons you might market it. You can say no psychoactive effect for the person who's worried about that, but the emphasis on zero percent THC, that's for someone who's either worried about their employer or about federal law. Like, the particular misrepresentation here is intimately tethered to the business harm that occurred, right?  And that won't be the case in every kind of, you know, average -- or product mislabeling case.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> What about the factual prediction?  Do you want to say anything about that?  Because the amicus briefs really are quite aggressive on that. And you could say  yes, but that's good, or you can say no, that's not going to happen. And, if it's the latter,  I'd like to hear why.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Right. So I think we have two data points for why this is unlikely to happen. The first is sort of the Ninth Circuit, as I explained. The second is, right, there are lots of product liability cases  --think the washing machine that floods your home, right  -- where there's no personal injury anywhere in the ambit, right?  It's all property damage. You see those cases. You see lots of those cases in state court. You don't see them being brought as civil RICO. That's not because of Petitioners' rule. Petitioners' rule has nothing to do with the oven that burns the house or the washing machine that floods the basement. That's all the other aspects of RICO are keeping that case out. So I think, you know, those are the two data points I can give you. You know, the -- and just the other thing I would say is I do think that the other guardrails do some work in fencing out those cases. I think that's why you don't see those cases being brought. And, again, as a kind of incentive matter, ruling out all pain and suffering and emotional distress means it isn't proper.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, you've said that umpteen times, which I  -- and I understand why you've said it.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> But lost wages and medical expenses are a huge part of personal injury tort suits, the damages.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> I think we -- I think that's right. My friend on the other side and I disagree on exactly what  --what fraction, but, you know, the Chamber of Commerce study that we cite in our brief says the lion's share of the recovery are these sort of non -pecuniary intangible harms. And I think that's correct, right? Medical expenses, you may see insurance companies bringing these suits, although I think, under Petitioners' theory, insurance companies can still sue for medical expenses, is  I think what they told you in the brief. But, in the sort of average case, the big incentives, I think that's why you're not seeing  -- I don't know the reason you're not seeing these cases in the Ninth Circuit or in the products liability that don't result in bodily injury contexts, but you're not. And I think that should  give you some solace. My fallback position is just Congress wrote this statute to just ask about an injury to business or property. That may have been profoundly unwise. It may have been profoundly unwise to use mail and wire fraud as predicate offenses.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And the federalism canon doesn't kick in at all you said. I just want to make I had that answer nailed down.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> I don't think the federalism canon kicks in because Petitioners have not been able to give you any definition that's tenable on the plain text of the statute, which is where the canon would kick in as a tie break, if at all.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And I just wanted to let you finish the discussion of whether or not this statute is overly broad. I mean, it gives  me some solace that we have actual text from Congress directing courts to liberally construe the provisions of RICO to effectuate its purposes. So it seems as though Congress contemplated that this was going to have a pretty broad sweep and that we should allow it to do that.</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> I think that's right. It's very rare Congress writes a liberal construction canon into the text of the statute. And I think that the ill that Congress was targeting is one that's sort of hard to pin down and define, right?  We've talked a little bit about the wire and mail fraud predicates, which I think are  -- I think sort of what is causing this Court some heartburn is the fact that mail and wire fraud are among the predicate offenses, and those seem to map onto a lot of state tort law claims but that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And it seems as though some of the concern is, you know, are we expanding beyond what the text says here and would it be a sea change that actually brings in  a lot of things that weren't intended to be covered, or is Ms. Blatt asking us to narrow down what the text says and make business and  -- or property, you know, narrower?  I kind of see it as the latter, but can you just speak to that as the final word here?</text><speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text> So I agree it would be the latter. ""Injury to business or property"" means injury to business or property, whether that's harm or legal harm. It just means that you are harmed in your ability to earn a livelihood. Now, again, I think that Congress used that language and used the liberal construction provision and put things like mail and wire fraud in the predicate -- in the list of predicate offenses because they wanted the statute to sweep quite broadly. And I think  that this Court should just enforce the text as it was written.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Ms. Blatt?</text>"
2,2024.23-852-t01,"<speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Gun Control Act imposes straightforward but essential requirements. Firearms sellers and manufacturers must mark their products with serial numbers, maintain sales records, and conduct background checks. The industry has followed those conditions without difficulty for more than half a century, and those basic requirements are crucial to solving gun crimes and keeping guns out of the hands of minors, felons, and domestic abusers. But, in recent years, companies like the Respondents here have tried to circumvent those requirements. They've begun selling firearms as easy -to-assemble kits and frames and receivers that require minimal work to be made functional. They've advertised the products, in their words, as ""ridiculously easy to assemble and dummy-proof"" and touted that you can go from opening the mail to have a fully functional gun  in as little as 15 minutes, no serial number, background check, or records required. Those untraceable guns are attractive to people who can't lawfully purchase them or  who plan to use them in crimes. As a result, our nation has seen an explosion in crimes committed with ghost guns. In the face of that public safety crisis, ATF promulgated this rule to underscore two points about the Gun Control Act's plain text. First, a weapon parts kit that can readily be converted to function as a gun with common tools, often in under an hour, is a covered firearm. Second, a product is a frame or receiver under the Act even if the buyer must drill a few holes or remove a few superfluous pieces of plastic to make it functional. Both of those points are consistent with how ATF has interpreted and implemented the Act across five decades and 11 different presidential administrations. Respondents now seek a sea change in the Act's scope. They claim that if a firearm isn't a hundred percent functional, if it's  missing just one hole that could be drilled in seconds and immediately assembled into a working gun, that product can be sold to anyone online  with no background check, no records, and no serial number. That contradicts the Act's plain text, and it also contradicts common sense. This Court should make clear that the Act regulates these products as what they are, firearms and frames and receivers of firearms. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> We will hear argument first this morning in Case 23-852, Garland versus VanDerStok. General Prelogar.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B.

That contradicts the Act's plain text, and it also contradicts common sense. This Court should make clear that the Act regulates these products as what they are, firearms and frames and receivers of firearms. I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Does this new regulation cover all of Chapter 44?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Yes. So I think that  the understanding of a firearm reflected in the Final Rule does reflect the  --the 922(a)(1)(iii) definition.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Would it  -- would this  --would it also apply under 924?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Yes. And so I think that that also incorporates, though, Justice Thomas, the mens rea requirements that are under 924, which I think guards against some of the concerns that Respondents have raised in this case that manufacturers could  unintentionally be swept up by these restrictions. For example, 924(a)(1)(D) requires a showing of willfulness with respect  to selling products without a serial number or without a license.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You make a lot of the fact that -- that you've been -- this has been regulated for half a century. But it wasn't regulated in this way for half a century. What was the  -- the original reg, the previous reg?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> The previous reg defined a frame or receiver with respect  to particular components that were housed in that primary structure. But, Justice Thomas, I agree that this rule reflects any fundamental change in approach because, under that p rior reg, ATF consistently recognized that even when that frame or receiver, the -- the primary structural component, wasn't yet fully finished or complete, still it would qualify as a firearm, looking at the same factors that are listed in the rule, things like how much time is it going to take to make it functional?  Do you need special equipment?  Do you need to buy parts,  and are they readily available?  Do you need special skill?  So all along, from 1968 on, the agency has consistently focused on this same issue of how quickly you can make that frame or receiver operational as part of a working gun. And the only change in the rule  -- and I want to openly acknowledge this as the rule does  --is that ATF is now taking account of jigs or templates, which are a form of tool that quickly speed up the process of making a frame or receiver functional because they show you exactly where you have to drill in that weapon, so there's no trial and error or guesswork. But, as ATF explained in the Final Rule, that wasn't a change in statutory interpretation. It was just a recognition that jigs serve precisely the same function as something like indexing, stamping the frame or receiver to show you where you have to drill. So it goes directly to the question that the agency has asked all along, namely, how quickly, easily, and efficiently can this process be completed.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Yeah, General, I'm looking at agency letters stretching back as -- as far back as 1978, and each of them basically used the same language that the current regulation is using. The agency letter in '78  said it evaluated an -- an item on whether it had reached a stage of manufacture such that it might be readily converted to functional condition, correct?  That's what you're tal king about?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Exactly right. And I think that that refutes Respondents' suggestion here that ATF has somehow been applying a different standard over the 50-year history of the Gun Control Act. Instead, ATF has always looked at whether the item has reached a critical stage of manufacture by reference to what work remains to be done to make it functional. So it's not like these are entirely separate and distinct contexts. As the 1978 classification letter you referenced makes clear, the only way to measure whether something has reached a critical stage of manufacture is to look at how close it is to the final product and what steps you need to take to turn that into a functional frame or receiver.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> General, I want to know what our standard of review here is, because I can imagine a frame or receiver that is just a block of metal that -- not readily convertible. I can also imagine some part kits  that require such tremendous amount of work that it doesn't qualify as readily convertible. So, if I can point to one item that wouldn't qualify, would  --could be swept  up potentially by your  --by the new regulation, is that enough to defeat a facial challenge?  Is it enough, or is that always an as-applied challenge?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> That is definitely not enough to defeat a facial challenge. So there is no particular product before the Court in this case. Respondents have chosen to sue in this facial pre-enforcement posture, and what that means is that the only question the Court should be asking in this case is whether there is anything on the face of the rule that is contradicted by the statutory text. In other words, whether the standards that ATF set forth in the rule are themselves contradicted by the statute and, therefore, foreclosed by the statute. And they can't make that showing here. It's certainly true that they try to suggest, and your question touches on the idea, that there might be particular marginal products out there that could test the bounds of whether  something is readily convertible, but the Court doesn't need to consider those kinds of products in this case because that can all be adjudicated on an as-applied basis going forw ard.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You -- you use the Reno  --you use the I -- our statement in INS versus NCIR, which basically tracks what you're just saying. But, in Reno versu s Flores, we used a different standard and said that a respondent, to prevail, must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the regulation would be valid. You didn't go that route.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> That would be an even more stringent standard  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I agree.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> -- and I think a -- burden that Respondents can't surmount. But we think even under the INS standard that we cite in our brief, it's very clear that there's nothing on the face of the Gun Control Act that</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> How about the --</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> -- prohibits this approach to regulation.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- Washington state range standard, which says, even if there might be some applications that are impermissible, those possible applications cannot render the rule facially invalid so long as the rule has a ""plainly legitimate sweep.""</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Yes, and I think that that standard is equally satisfied as well here. You pointed to the hypothetical possibility of marginal cases where a product would take a lot of time to put together, but I want to emphasize the core of the conduct that this Act regulates, which were the ghost  gun kits and partially complete frames or receivers that were flooding the market leading up to promulgation of this rule. Those are issues or -- or products where the readily convertible determination was  not hard at all because the products were specifically designed and marketed to individuals who could put them together with no  specialized skill, often in under an hour, with common hand tools. And so I acknowledge the point that maybe there could be other hypothetical applications of the rule that could test the bounds with respect to certain factors, but I think that under any conceivable standard for adjudicating this facial challenge, Respondents haven't come anywhere close to satisfying their burden to show that the statute squarely forecloses the standards in the rule.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> What is the meaning of the term ""weapon"" in 921(a)(3)(A)?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> That's  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Can you give me a definition?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Sure. So that's an undefined term, and we think it therefore carries its plain dictionary definition as an -- instrument of offensive or defensive combat. But nothing in Congress's use of the term  ""weapon"" suggests that it has to presently be functional as an instrument of combat in order to qualify. And, in fact, I would say the rest of the  -- the statutory provision makes clear that the weapon might well have to undergo a conversion in order to operate as a gun.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> It may --</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> There's an express</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> -- it may have to undergo a conversion, but before it's converted, it must be a weapon?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> That's right. We certainly don't dispute that it has to be an instrument of combat designed and intended to be used in this way. And Congress made clear in the statut ory history that the reason it used that term is because there are objects out there, toys and tools, that have a well-known non-weapon use but that actually do expel projectiles through the action of an explosive. A -- a cap gun is an example of this. It  -- it expels bird shot, and so, therefore, it would fit within the functional definition. But  it's not a weapon because it's not an instrument of combat or intended to be used in that way.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> But is it  -- is it the case that components that can easily be  converted into something constitute that thing before they are converted as a matter of ordinary usage?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> I think that as a matter of ordinary usage, we're not suggesting that any statutory reference to one thing includes separate and distinct things that can be readily converted. So shifting to our arguments under framer/receiver, subparagraph B  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, no, I  --I want to stick with the definition of ""weapon"" for just a second.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Oh, sure.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> I'm going to show you. Here's a  --here's a blank pad, and here's a pen, all right?  Is this a grocery list?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> I don't think that that's a grocery list, but the reason for that is because there are a lot of things you could use those products for to create something other  than a grocery list.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. If I show</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> And so it's not like they're  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> -- if I show you -- I put out on a counter some eggs, some chopped-up ham, some chopped-up pepper, and onions, is that a western omelet?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> No, because, again, those items have well-known other uses to become something other than an omelet. The key difference here is that these weapon parts kits are designed and intended to be used as instruments of combat, and they have no other conceivable use. And I think the further evidence comes from the fact that Respondents themselves agree that a disassembled gun qualifies as a weapon. So this is on page 37 of the Anderson brief.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. So that's helpful. So your definition is a -- a -- a group of components that are -- can readily be -- converted into something and have no other use. They must have no other use in order to constitute that thing?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> In the circumstance</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> In that situation, they already constitute that thing?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> I think that you can recognize that something is a weapon even if it's non-functional if it is clear from objective evidence of --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> No, I think that certainly is true from the face of the statute because it has to be  --it's sufficient if it's capable of being converted into  --into something that can expel a projectile. All right. Thank you.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> General Prelogar, I just want to follow up on Justice Alito's question about the omelet. Would your answer change if you ordered it from HelloFresh and you got a kit, and it was like turkey chili, but all of the ingredients are in the kit?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Yes. And I think that that presses on the  --the more apt analogy here, which is that we are not suggesting that scattered components that might have some  entirely separate and distinct function could be aggregated and called a weapon in the absence of this kind of evidence that that is their intended purpose and function. But, if you bought, you know, from Trader Joe's some omelet-making kit that had all of the ingredients to make the omelet and maybe included whatever you would need to start the fire in order to cook the omelet and had all of that objective indication that that's what's being marketed and sold, we would recognize that for what it is. And it -- it doesn't stretch plain English to say, I bought omelets at the store, if you bought all of the ingredients that were intended and designed to make them, especially under statutory language that refers to something like breakfast foods or things that can be readily converted to make breakfast.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Can I -- oh.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Can I ask you about the difference between the ""destructive device"" and ""machine gun"" definitions that also reference parts in the way that this definition does not?  I've just been thinking about, in 1968, in the Gun Control Act, why Congress might have done that differently. And these ghost guns weren't around. These kits are a more  recent problem, which doesn't mean that the plain language doesn't cover the unintended consequence. But, in 1968 -- and I don't know enough about the gun industry to know if this is right, which is why I want your take on this -- wasn't it the case then, I think, that destructive devices like grenades or even machine guns were not things that you tended to buy whole because they were so heavily regulated and  -- and even illegal to purchase that way as opposed to firearms?  So they were generally purchased as components or things that were, you know, able to be converted or made  -- like, it would make sense to think about it in terms of parts? Am I thinking about that correctly based on the industry at the time?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Yes, you're exactly right about that relevant difference and how  people were ordinarily constructing things like destructive devices that weren't sold in these types of kits. And I think the important thing to recognize and what this question presses on is  that Congress can use a variety of verbal formulations to cover similar types of conduct. Each of these other definitions that Respondents have pointed to that refer explicitly to parts were enacted at different times from the relevant definition of a ""firearm,"" and they address different issues in the way that your question touched on. But what Respondents are doing is ignoring the language of the statute that Congress did use in 1968, and it expressly referred to things that can be readily converted to function to expel a projectile through the action of an explosive. It's hard for me to see how a weapon parts kit doesn't fit within that plain language because, quite literally, the kit is intended  and designed to produce that functioning weapon in a very short amount of time by people who don't know anything about guns and can do it with relatively little skill.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> General, I understand your argument under (A) with respect to things that could be readily converted, but there's also the argument under (B), frame or receiver, which doesn't include that kind of language that might bring in artifact nouns more obviously. What -- what's your thought about that?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> So I do think there's language in (B) that gets us there, and it's the fact that Congress referred to ""frame or receiver"" but didn't expressly define that term. It's true that in subparagraph (A) Congress used the exact language ""readily converted,"" but that's because that's Congress's definition of the term. And if it had defined it solely in terms of the functionality of a gun, you know, if it had just said something that functions as a gun, that would be limited to operational weapons. So Congress had a really good reason to use the language there.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Got you. I follow all of that.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Yeah. So  then in -- in --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Now moving on to (B), though.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> So moving on to (B), Congress didn't define the term, which means it carries its plain and ordinary meaning. And we think that the ordinary meaning of a noun like ""frame"" or ""receiver"" includes obj ects that are nearly complete but are missing just a few holes that need to be drilled.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Now we can't possibly think that every noun that Congress uses everywhere in the U.S. Code is used as an artifact noun that carries with it things like Justice Alito's pen and pencil as a grocery list, right?  So there's got to be a line that makes this on -- on your theory of the case why we should read that into (B) here but not everywhere in the U.S. Code. What -- what -- what -- what are your thoughts?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Right. So I want to be very clear that we think that this is a matter of ordinary meaning that you don't need  it to be a hundred percent complete. And that  -- I think that runs across the board. If I mentioned a bicycle, but it was missing pedals, as we explain in our brief, you would still recognize that for what it is, as a bicycle. That's the first order question. But then the second question arises  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> But  --</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> -- that you touched on  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- if you --if I'm not inclined to think that every noun is used in that way in the U.S. Code, I mean, that would be a very dramatic argument  --</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- right?  Lenity, notice, fair notice to people that every piece of paper and pen is a grocery list, you're on notice of that. But is there something particular to this statute that you think would -- a more narrow approach?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Yes. We think the context and purpose of the statute strongly support understanding the term in this way. And  the reason for that is because, throughout the federal firearms laws, whenever Congress has itself expressly provided a definition, it has  included not only the fully complete and functional item but things that are the item and can readily be made to function that way. So I think that's Congress's own indication in this statute that it's trying to ensure coverage not only of things that have the functionality of a frame or receiver at the moment they're sold but frames or receivers that can be readily converted to function with minimal steps.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Well, if you have something textual, I'd love for you to point me to that and also address  --your friends on the other side I'm sure are going to make something of this, that as recently as 2021, in a brief filed in the Southern District of New York, the government represented that an unfinished frame or receiver does not meet the statutory definition of ""firearm.""</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Sure. So let me take those in turn. With respect to text, what we have, Justice Gorsuch, is the term ""frame or receiver"" that's not defined, and the Court has many times recognized it needs to interpret text and  context. I think the anti -circumvention principle carries a lot  of weight here because, if Respondents are right and just one undrilled hole is enough, then, basically, that covers where ""frame and receiver"" --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Does it --</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> -- does no work.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- does it help that (C)  and (D) deal with mufflers, silencers, and any other destructive devices that don't have conventional frames and receivers?  Does that help you?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> I think that that just goes to  show that Congress was trying to broadly cover the scope of products that can qualify as firearms, and it certainly refutes Respondents' suggestion here that every covered  object under the statutory definition needs to have a traditional frame or receiver.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah, that's why I'm wondering whether we can  --whether, looking at (C) and (D) and (A), which, as you say --</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- carry some broad language about not just complete items, might be a textual way to -- to -- to  --to narrow and focus on (B) without saying every artifact noun in the U.S. Code carries this feature?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Yes, I think you certainly could adopt that interpretation, and that contextual surrounding evidence strongly supports our arguments in this case. I don't want to lose track of your question about the brief  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> -- the district court filing  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> -- in the Syracuse case. I want to be really clear that I think Respondents are fundamentally misreading that brief. They suggest that the brief stood for the principle that ATF was arguing that a frame or receiver has to be fully functional to qualify. But, if you actually look at that brief, that's not what it says. It walks through the statutory and regulatory history  here and makes clear that repeatedly, over five decades, ATF has always looked at whether a partially complete frame or receiver can be brought to functional condition quickly, easily, and efficiently. So there is no dramatic break in the way that ATF has regulated throughout the entirety of the statute's history.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Well, I'll look at that again. And then last question from me and I'm sorry to take up so much time. In the regulation, it indicates that a frame or receiver  --and I'm stuck on this (B) point --</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- which has been cut into pieces is still a firearm  --</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> So this has  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- but --but one that's been shredded is not. Now I'm not sure what the difference between cut into pieces and shredding is, but perhaps you can enlighten me  and help me there.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> So this refers to when you already have a fully complete and  functional firearm, what steps you would need to undertake to formally destroy that firearm and exempt it from regulation. Those are not  provisions --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So it's no longer readily convertible, right?  And --</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> So, once you actually have already brought something within the regulatory scope of the statute, the -- the statute itself and the agency's regulations require that it be destroyed, which is a specialized term in the firearms industry. I can tell you as a factual matter that the most common way that you destroy a firearm is to torch-cut it in -- in -- with three specified cuts that ATF has provided --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Well --</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> -- guidance about.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- this is -- this -- 28 is  --I'm sorry to interrupt, but this is actually about frames and receivers that I'm  talking about, and it's 48 -- 478.12(c) and (e).</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay?  And it -- and it talks about partially complete, disassembled, or nonfunctional frame or receiver. That's  what we're talking about, not the firearm. And, again, maybe  --maybe there's a line that I -- a through line, but I couldn't find one between shredding and cutting into pieces. I would have thought that's pretty much the same thing.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> So that comes, as you mention, from 478.12(e), which I should note Respondents haven't challenged in this case. It tees up a distinct statutory issue about what it takes to destroy a frame or receiver or a regulated object once you already have a firearm. They aren't challenging that here. And the only thing that is before the Court is the definition in (B), recognizing that --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right, but -- but it</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> -- you don't need a fully functional firearm in the first place to -- 29 have  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> No, but it illuminates what is a sufficiently complete frame or receiver if a complete frame or receiver is not a firearm. And the only way I  can be sure that I don't have a fully complete or nearly complete or convertibly complete frame or receiver and therefore a firearm is to shred  it but not cut it into pieces.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Oh. No, let me -- let me try to clarify that --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah, that -- they</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> -- because that's not accurate at all.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. Right.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> As the regulation itself makes clear, you don't even get to the question of asking whether it's regularly -- readily converted into functional shape unless you have the clearly identifiable unfinished component part, so you have something that is already well along the way to being a frame or receiver, and that's when you would conduct the readily converted inquiry. -- And there is nothing in the rule or in the agency's past practice to suggest that anything that isn't shredded or cut up or absolutely destroyed is going to be considered a frame or receiver. That would be entirely inconsistent with how the agency has implemented</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. Thank you.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> -- the statute all along.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Under the rule, what percentage of the parts of a firearm kit must -- must be included in order for it to be a firearm kit?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> So these kits always come with a frame or receiver. And I think that that's going to be a necessary part. That's usually the part that needs just a couple of holes drilled or pieces of plastic r emoved. And then the weapon parts kits generally come with the additional components that will allow you to form a fully functioning gun. If you're asking whether it would still qualify as a regulated weapon that can be readily converted if it were missing other parts, you know, I think that's a matter of degree and it presses on what it means to readily convert. It might be fact-specific, so if the part you're missing is something that is super-specialized and would be hard to track down or is going to cost you a million dollars, that might not be readily converted. But, if  you have something that's missing a single pin that you might even have lying around the house, it probably will be. Again, in this facial challenge, I don't think it's necessary for the Court to consider all of the possible permutations of how this could play out with respect to different types of products. The thing that you need to be asking is, did the agency reasonably define the term ""readily""?  And it did because it gave it its ordinary definition of a process that's quick, easy, and efficient. And then did the agency identify relevant factors?  And I  think it did with respect to things like time, expertise, scope of work, and, as your question touched on, what parts you would need to actually make it functional.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> General, we have a clue from the statute's use of a starter gun as an example of something that's readily convertible. As I understand it, to make a starter gun operable, you either have to replace  the bore, so you need a new bore part to do that, or you have to drill out the existing  bore on the starter gun and get a pin to make it operable, correct?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> That's right. So the most commonly publicized example that I think was top of mind for Congress, and it's one that's cited in the statutory history here, was the example of a -- a gang member who bought the starter guns in bulk and then, you're exactly right, had to drill out the plugged barrel or else cut it off and rethread it and put in a new barrel. And often you also have to enlarge the barrel so that it can chamber conventional ammunition if it isn't already able to accept bullets.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So we know that some incomplete items qualify under the statute's definition?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Yes. And I think that also show -- I think shows, as the statutory text makes clear, that things that  aren't presently functioning as guns but can be readily converted to function are covered under subparagraph (A). That was exactly what  Congress was trying to accomplish, to ensure that these things that are going to be used as instruments of combat and that can be completed to functional condition with minimal work would come within the scope of the federal firearms laws.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Were weapons parts kits common in 1968?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> So there have only been a couple of examples over the  years that I'm aware of reflected in the case law. We cite the Stewart case and the Wick case. One of those was kind of an Uzi-making kit. Another one involved someone who was making it possible through kit form to construct a machine gun. It wasn't particularly common then, and I can tell you the reason why. The big development and the technological development  that led to the explosion of ghost guns was using polymer --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Right. Well  --</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> -- a form of plastic, to make this.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> -- are there gun kits available now that do not consist of polymer  parts but instead consist of parts taken from disassembled firearms that have been altered in a way to make them nonfunctional without some modification?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> I'm not aware of any commercial product right now that  --that fits that description.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> On what it means to be readily convertible, I -- I don't know whether it's possible to do something. That's the statutory term, and I don't know whether it's possible to do something more precise than what ATF has done, but it would be interesting if  -- it would be helpful if you could perhaps explain a little bit more what that means. So what level of expertise is taken into account?  What collection of tools is taken into account?  Can you provide an y sort of a time limit?  How long must it take?  Some of us who are not -- who don't have a lot of mechanical ability have spent hours and hours and hours trying to assemble  things that we've purchased. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> I'm with you on that one, Justice Alito, as someone who struggles with IKEA furniture. Let me do my best to try to be responsive to that question. And I think the thing to point to is the case law on this point because ATF wasn't just coming up with these factors out of nowhere. Instead, because this is the term that Congress used in the statute, we have 50 years of judicial precedent further fleshing out the contours of when something can be readily converted. So, as a general matter, what the courts and, therefore, what the agency has said is that  it is readily converted if someone -- if a novice, in a fairly quick amount of time, can easily and efficiently convert the weapon to function. You asked about outside bounds like time limits. I can tell you that in the case law, the longest period of time that was ever deemed still r eadily convertible was eight hours. And the agency has not considered any product greater than eight hours to be readily convertible. So, if that issue were squarely presented, a  court might hold that something like a day's work or eight hours sets an outer bound. With respect to things like skill or -- or parts availability, obviously, that's going to be facts  -- fact-and context-specific. And I think the important thing to recognize is that these are principles that were themselves drawn from case law. And the agency,  I think, can't be expected to do better than courts themselves have done in trying to flesh out the qualitative standard that Congress chose to use here.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?  Justice Kagan?</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> On parts kits first. In addition to the parts kit that's analogous to an IKEA table kit, Judge O'Connor below was concerned that that language would include sort of any aggregation of gun parts. So let's say, you know, a gunsmith just wanted to replenish inventory and got a big box of gun parts generally from a gun manufacturer. Would that count under the ATF  regulation?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> No. The lower court fundamentally misunderstood how this Final Rule operates. In the first place, it doesn't regulate something like a gunsmith at home who's buying individual parts and seeking to aggregate them. This is a regulation that only governs commercial manufacturers and sellers of firearms who are themselves constructing the  -- the weapons and the kits and putting them on the market. So these are just conditions o n commercial sale. And then, with respect to what the rule would cover, it's clear from the ""readily convertible"" analysis that you need to have a process that's fairly quick, easy, and efficient. And so it wouldn't sweep in things that have a lot of other uses and that would  require a lot of skill and expertise or time to track down the missing parts to put together. And I want to emphasize again it's not like ATF was coming up with this rule without real-world experience about the kinds of market -- kinds of products that these fringe manufacturers were putting on the market. These were kits that you could put together in under an hour. They had all of the relevant components. You would just need to do a little bit of finishing work. I actually had the experience of putting one of these kits together, and it's just like what the record shows. There are usually only a couple of steps. The first thing that most of the kits require is drilling t he holes. Usually, it's six holes, and you do it with a jig. So you have the product there in the tool, and it removes all of the trial and error or guesswork. You know exactly  where to drill in seconds. The second step is to remove the extra plastic blocking tabs. That, again, doesn't  require much work at all because you clip them off with a pair of pliers or a box cutter. You can file it down with a jig as a template using a metal nail file or using a Dremel rotary tool that a lot of people, especially dog owners, own  because it's helpful for trimming your dog's nails. At that point, you have a fully functional frame or receiver, and you can quickly assemble it into a gun in no time at all. That's how the products were marketed. That's how they were sold.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And turning to the frames or receivers, you made a point of saying that this follows in a long line of regulation. But there --- there were changes, right, that you  -- that the new regulation is intended to capture items sold with jigs and templates. Is there anything else that the new regulation was intended to capture that was not captured under the old?  And why did ATF make that change?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> No, that is the only change. ATF made that change and openly acknowledged and justified its decision because it recognized that when you have a jig, which is this tool, as I mentioned, that removes all of the trial and error and really does make it dummy-proof, as the manufacturers have claimed, it goes directly to the question the agency has asked all along, which is:  How quickly, easily,  and efficiently can this thing be made to function?  So it's no different in kind from indexing on the frame or receiver. Indexing is something that ATF has looked at from 1968 on. It's always recognized that if you actually put a dimple in the frame or through the body of the structural component, that's going to speed up the process. And jigs work exactly the same way.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And let me ask you a broader question if we step back a little bit. Sometimes this Court looks at regulations and it says, you know, there's an old statute, and the old statute doesn't contemplate a new problem, and a new problem comes up, and Congress can't get its act together and deal with the old problem. And so the agency takes old statutory language that doesn't really fit the problem  but, you know, is vague enough or general enough or broad enough, you know, so that it can be kind of made to deal with the new problem. And -- and this Court has sometimes said:  Well, that's  --that's not right. The new statute had nothing to do with  -- the old statute had nothing to do with this new problem, and this is kind of, you know, the agency just taking over what is really Congress's business. Is -- is that a story line that the Respondents here can tell about this regulation?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> No. I don't think there is any tenable way to characterize this regulation as -- as an attempt to change the meaning of the statute to confront a new problem. First of all, this is an age-old problem. Congress, I think, rightly recognized that manufacturers might seek to evade these central requirements. That's why anytime it's expressly defined a term, like in subparagraph (A), it's included concepts of whether an  item can be readily made to function. We think the weapon parts kits are precisely described by that subparagraph (A) description. I acknowledge in subparagraph (B) it's not a defined term, ""frame or receiver.""  But there again, we think that Congress was simply tracking ordinary meaning, which recognizes that  if you have that principal structural component of a handgun, that can be recognized as a frame or receiver even if it's missing the single, final hole that you need to drill in that. So I think it would be wrong to suggest that the statutory language just on its own terms doesn't cover this situation. And then, on top of that, we have context and purpose here. On Respondents' theory of this statute, it would be incredibly easy for any gun manufacturer to avoid the regulation and the essential requirements of serializing, background checks, and recordkeeping just by leaving one little part of the weapon or the frame or receiver unfinished. Plainly, that's not what Congress was intending. And I think it brings this case squarely within cases like Abramski, where, as you know, Justice Kagan, the  --the Court recognized that if you have an interpretation of the Gun Control Act that is going to allow that entire circumvention and essentially nullify the Act's requirements, the statute shouldn't  properly be interpreted that way.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> That was a close case. You maybe want this to be a stronger case than Abramski.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> It is a stronger case. And the circumvention here is even more profound because it wouldn't just be in the sales transactions with the straw purchaser. It would effectively be all weapons going forward would not need to be serialized or sold with background checks and recordkeeping.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Gorsuch?  Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Your statutory interpretation has force, but I had some concern at the state stage, and I have some concern now about mens rea. And this is an agency regulation that broadens a criminal statute beyond what it had been before. So what about the seller, for example, who is truly not aware, truly not aware that they are violating the law and gets criminally charged?  What assurances can you give about mens rea, about the instructions to the jury  that the government would seek, and the like?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> So let me begin with the statutory mens rea standard that I think fully addresses this concern. This is in 18 U.S.C. 924(a)(1)(D), and it requires willfulness. So that means that if a -- a manufacturer isn't putting a serial number on it because the manufacturer believes in good faith that this isn't a regulated product and the manufacturer doesn't know that it's violating the law, it will not be criminally chargeable because the government won't be able to prove that mens rea of willfulness. So I think that's an important check against criminal prosecutions that might be unwarranted. The second thing I would point to is the  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And does ""willfully"" apply to all potential prosecutions that we're talking about in this case?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> It applies if there's no serial number on the weapon, and it applies if there's  -- if the weapon is being sold without a license. I believe that with respect to not conducting a background check, that's under a different provision that requires knowledge. But, of course, the kind of entry point for the weapon is whether or not it has a serial number, and that happens at the point of manufacture. I also want to emphasize that to the extent that there is really  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> So how would that work on the background check?  I just want to make sure I'm not missing something there.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Yeah. So I think, on the background check, if you have a seller out there who -- who wants guidance about whether, with respect to particular type of products, it's necessary to do that background check, the -- the person can seek a classification from ATF. The manufacturers would be the ones to do this. And this is a way to get a pre-enforcement dispositive ruling from ATF as to whether that's deemed a regulated firearm. And in that circumstance, if you don't like the answer that ATF gives, you have a right to judicial review that will be conducted under a de novo standard about whether this is a covered product.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> But, if you haven't done that, let's say you haven't done that, and you truly  --</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- take the hypothetical  --you truly believe you're not violating the law, could you be charged under that provision?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> As a theoretical possibility, I think only with respect to background checks, it's possible you could. I'm not aware of any prosecutions that look like this. And the whole point of this reg --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Is that something the government would do?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> I don't think the government would be likely to charge someone in that kind of situation. And it doesn't look anything like what was happening where the manufacturers were themselves the sellers putting these products on the market with  explicit knowledge that it was being put into the hands of teenagers --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. That's  --</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> -- felons, and so forth.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- that's helpful. Anything else you wanted to finish up with on that?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> So I guess the only other thing I would say is that we think that there is a lot of protection for manufacturers who  are seeking to comply with the law in good faith. ATF is not trying to hide the ball here. The point of the agency is not a game of gotcha to try to criminally prosecute people. There was a very serious public safety threat posed by the explosion in the use of these gun -- these ghost guns in crimes, and so the whole point of this regulation is simply to put the regulated industry on notice of how the statute applies in that discrete context and how it's always applied si nce the statute was enacted.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And on that point, because you had a lot of classification letters that were out there, this was to collect  everything and put everyone, as you say, on notice, adding a couple things, as you pointed out earlier, correct?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Right. And so I don't think that this is any vast expansion of the statute. We just think this is ATF's long standing interpretation with the addition  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Some expansion. Some expansion.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> -- only with the addition of looking at jigs. But -- but --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> -- to be clear, that doesn't change the meaning of the statute.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> It just changes the factors that are relevant under the statute when you're conducting a ""readily"" analysis.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> I have a question about AR-15s. So Judge Oldham expressed concern that because AR-15 receivers can be readily converted into machine gun receivers, that this  regulation on its face turns everyone who lawfully owns an AR-15 into a criminal.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> That is wrong. So I want to be really clear about our interpretation of the statute. We are not suggesting that a statutory reference to one thing includes all other separate and distinct things that might be readily converted into the thing that's listed in the statute itself. So the example we give in our reply brief is that a pair of pants is not regulated as a pair of shorts if you have a statute referring to shorts even though the pants could be readily converted into shorts. That's because pants are a distinct object in their own right and they have a separate identity. And the rule itself incorporates this principle by requiring that the regulated object, before you even get to a ""readily"" analysis, has to be clearly identifiable as the unfinished component part of the regulated weapon. So what that means is you would have to say this thing is a clearly unfinished component part o f a machine gun, a weapon that's designed to fire automatically more than one shot with a single function of the trigger. But you couldn't say that about an AR -15. That is obviously something that's designed and intended to be used for semi-automatic fire. And the fact that you might be able to undertake certain drilling and machining operations to convert it into a machine gun doesn't mean that while it has this separate identity and is standing alone, it would be regulated as a machine gun. The agency has never held otherwise. This again is the same interpretation that the agency has had all along, and it has never suggested that AR-15s, standing alone, are regulated machine guns.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So Justice Kagan talked about the problem of the agency potentially taking over what is Congress's business, and I guess I'm worried about the  different concern, which is about the Court taking over what Congress may have intended for the agency to do in this situation. And so all of my questions -- the reason why I didn't  really engage in the other part of this is because all of my questions really for you stem from that concern. You -- you've phrased the question presented in this case as whether certain items, weapons, parts, and kits, or partially complete and disassembled frames or receivers qualify as firearms within the meaning of the statute. And I guess I'm concerned about this framing because it doesn't seem to account, in my view, for the actual claim that the challengers have made here, which is that the ag ency has exceeded its statutory authority. And so I'm trying to figure out how we're supposed to address what I think is a distinct question about the scope of the agency's authority vis --vis the Court to fill out the category of what is a firearm. I mean, are we to conclude that an agency exceeds its statutory authority whenever it fails to choose what we think is the best meaning of a statutory term?  Is that how the -- the scope of the agency's authority to promulgate a rule is supposed to be determined? We just compare what the agency believes qualifies as a firearm with what we think qualifies as a firearm, and if the agency has something in its definition that we wouldn't have put there, we say the agency has exceeded its authority?  I think those seem not right to me as the way of figuring out the question of exceeding the authority, and I think it can't be assumed that the agency exceeds its authority whenever it interprets a statutory term differently than we would such that all we have to do as a part of this claim here today is just decide what we think a firearm is. Can you react to that?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Sure. So I think, as in any statutory interpretation case, the task of this Court is to determine what Congress intended and what it meant. And we think that we have clearly the best interpretation of the language that Congress used, but the Court has  said time and again that you don't just look at text, you interpret that text in context.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right. But can I just  --</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> And you can take account of --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- can --can I take you on a little bit of a  --let me just drill down a little bit, right?  The term we are interpreting, I thought, was a category . Congress has said firearms, right, and frames and receivers, which it defines, the firearms part of it, have to be treated in a certain way. And I think, in order to implement this statute, the agency has to look at real -world circumstances and determine what particular items fit into that category. I understood the delegation of this entire thing to an agency to be that task. That's what the agency's supposed to be doing. We look at firearm. We look at the definition of the firearm, says the agency, and we look at things in the world, and we say X, Y, Z, those are in that category. My question is, when the challenge is X shouldn't have been in that category, does it exceed the agency's authority if the Court thinks, yeah, X shouldn't have been in that category?  Just, you know -- I mean, the agency still has the authority, I think, and in Loper,  Loper seemed to recognize that Congress may have given the agency the authority to make certain calls, right?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> So  --so I think, in responding to this question --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> -- it's really helpful to distinguish between the facial challenge here and some of these as-applied applications of the agency's determination of what fits within the definition.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> I do think that if the Court concluded that Congress, in drafting this statute, had, for example, categorically precluded looking at time in deciding whether something's readily convertible, then the agency would be exceeding its authority because, of  course, if Congress has said in the statute you can't think about time --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> -- then the agency can't choose to do so.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> We are miles away from that kind of situation here because all of the factors the agency listed on their face are consistent with the plain meaning of what it is to readily prepare.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So what you would have us do is not come up with our list of what items we think should be in the firearm category, like we have to think about exactly each thing. In this facial challenge, I think you're saying we need to do something more like did the agency take into account the relevant factors for making the determination of what goes in this category?</text><speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> That's right, because you don't have any particular products in front of you to examine in light of whether they would fit the definition or not. The only relevant question in this case is the facial question of does this regulation conflict with  anything in the Gun Control Act?  And our answer is no, we think that this follows from the plain  text of the Gun Control Act and is consistent with judicial precedent interpreting that plain text. With respect to any follow-on questions about particular products, that could all be assessed as applied in light of their specific facts to make a determination about how the factors might cash out in an individual case. Before the front -line question of the agency's authority here, we think everything in the Final Rule is consistent with the statute Congress wrote.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Mr. Patterson.</text>","<speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  This case turns on decisions made by Congress in the Gun Control Act of 1968. First, Congress altered the common understanding of ""firearm"" to include other  weapons that may readily be converted to firearms. Second, in a departure from prior federal law, Congress decided to regulate only a  single part of a firearm, the frame or receiver, and Congress did not alter the common understanding of a ""frame or receiver.""  ATF has now exceeded its authority by operating outside of the bounds set by Congress. One, ATF has expanded the definition of ""frame or receiver"" to include items that may readily be converted to a frame or receiver. And, two, ATF has expanded the definition of ""firearm"" to include collections of parts that are not weapons and that do not include a frame or receiver. Some concern has been raised about circumvention, but, of course, complying with a statute is not circumventing it. And as this Court said in Abramski, which has already been referenced, Congress, in the Gun Control Act,  did not seek to pursue its purposes of controlling access to firearms to the nth degree. And, notably, Congress did not regulate the secondary market for firearms, and that secondary market is a much bigger source of firearms for criminals than privately made firearms. There also has been questions raised about the agency's prior practice. There definitely has been a sea change by the agency here. The agency projected that its rule would put 42 out of 43 unlicensed manufacturers out of business. And what the agency said in the Syracuse litigation was they said:  ""An unfinished frame or receiver does not meet the statutory definition of 'firearm' simply because it can be designed to or can readily be converted into a frame or receiver.""  That's the exact standard t hey've now adopted. Instead, what they looked at was whether critical machining operations had taken place. And, to be clear, we have no quarrel with that prior practice. We have raised as alternatives, one, something has to be  completely machined, or, two, the critical machining operation test. And the -- the latter, we submit, is more consistent with the statutory language and solves the machine gun problem because, if you say, in the machine gun provision, a frame or receiver is also regulated, and if one hole is all that separates a semi-automatic receiver from a machine gun receiver, it's hard to see how the ""readily"" standard would not also be applied there.

I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Judge Oldham makes much of the 80 percent rule that was --</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> -- at the stage of manufacture versus the ready  --what a receiver or an item is capable or ready -- can readily become. And we've had much discussion here about ""readily"" this morning. Is that analysis or that approach -- does  --does it make a difference as -- to your argument whether it is the 80 percent rule or the current ""readily become"" rule?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Yes, I think it does and for at least three reasons. One, we  -- we submit it can't be ""readily"" because, when Congress wanted it to be  ""readily,"" it put it in the statute in multiple circumstances. Two, it has a different practical impact, for example, in the machine gun frame example. So, if it  --if the standard is ""readily"" and the government gives as kind of the paradigmatic example of ""readily"" drilling one hole, well, if all you have to do is drill one hole into a receiver to make it a machine gun receiver, it's hard to see how that is not a machine gun receiver. And, three, the -- Congress said ""the frame or receiver.""  What Congress did not include in this statute was parts that may be used to convert an item into  --</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> I think I'm --</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> -- a frame or receiver.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> -- a bit more interested in how the 80 percent rule operated. We've -- we've heard --</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> -- much about the ""readily"" this morning --</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> -- and -- and whether or not that change actually took place and whether it really matters.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Yes, it does really  matter. And just the 80 percent rule is kind of a colloquialism used in the industry. What the governing standard was was called the critical machining operations test. And what the agency would do, based on what the definition of a frame or receiver is, the part that holds the essential firing and sealing components of a firearm, would say: We're going to look at that part of the firearm and see if critical machining operations have taken place. And then, as a crosscheck, there sometimes would be temporal considerations. This is what the agency said in the Syracuse litigation. Temporal considerations were tied to the degree of machining. It was kind of like a lodestar crosscheck in a fees case. So they would look at those temporal considerations. But where the different  -- where the difference would be made  -- and we can see this very clearly in the regulation that the AR-15 lowers, and that is the same piece of metal can be considered a frame or receiver depending on what is sold with it. Under the old standard, you would look at the item itself, and that's what Congress did in the Act. They said:  Look at the item itself. It did not say:  Look at other things that may be used to convert that item into a frame or receiver. And that's what the agency is now doing, for example, with looking at the jigs because, really, what is being done is that jig is being regulated because the same piece of metal can either be a frame or receiver depending on what is sold with it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But I thought  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What would --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- ""readily convertible"" was in the statute.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> ""Readily convertible"" -- 63 is in the statute under part A.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> It is not in the statute under part B. So then you cannot  --it would be very odd to say that, well, we're going  to say ""readily convertible"" is a implicit in every term.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For a frame and receiver.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counsel  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But does the 80 percent rule apply then to part A?  I'm just trying to understand your answer to Justice Thomas with respect to the 80 percent rule.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Yes. And, again, understanding that we're using 80 percent rule</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes. Yes.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> -- as a stand -in for critical machining operations. No, that part  -- applies to part B. That is what the agency would look at to determine whether something had become a frame or receiver. And -- and if you're --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counsel, doesn't that  --</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- give your game away?  Once you admit that you need to figure  out when something has become a finished product, you have to have a standard to decide that. And you're saying the standard has to be something along -- that -- that goes to manufacturing. The SG is saying:  Yes, that's just a silent way of saying, has the manufacturing gone far enough to make this essentially a  --a -- a frame or receiver?  Can it be converted to be fully functional?  That's what they're saying, that the two are doing exactly the same thing. You prefer one because you want to sell frames without a serial number or -- or sell frames that you have to drill a hole in and say that's not regulated. They're saying a hole is really not a critical component of the frame. Everything else is.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Well  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So I  --I -- I -- I'm having difficulty understanding, once you admit that some sort of test is necessary, why  this particular test exceeds their statutory authority --</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Yes. And so --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- since it's only a different way of getting to the same thing.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Understood.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Do I have enough  of a frame or receiver to call it a frame and receiver.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Understood. And to be clear, we provided the Court two alternatives. One is that all of the machining operations have taken place. So, if you were to say this was a sculptor, all the chiseling has been done, everything's been done, that this can now function as a frame or receiver.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well, you --</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Our alternative  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- are you -- you don't disagree that taking a tab off a frame, is that a completed frame?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> I  --I think -- I don't think taking a tab off, if you could do it with your finger, that's not  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> -- like actually removing material that's  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So, if you have to drill a hole to attach it to something, that's not a completed frame?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Well, this is where the difference between the two alternatives that we have given the Court comes in. Under the first alternative, drilling a single hole would be what would make it cross the line. And the government admits that sometimes drilling a single hole can be the difference between a semi-automatic receiver and a machine gun receiver. And a machine gun receiver is much more heavily regulated than a semi-automatic receiver. So the notion that just one hole separating something from another item is somehow absurd is clearly not the case. But the alternative we've given you is the critical machining operations test, and that is different from the government's new test because, A, it's not conflicting with the statute by taking language from another part of the statute that's not there and putting it there and where the government represented in  the Syracuse litigation in 2021 we can't do that.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Let me  --</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- come at it -- oh, I'm sorry, Chief, please.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Just what would -- what is the purpose of selling a receiver without the holes drilled in it?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Well, the  -- some individuals  -- just like s ome individuals enjoy, like, working on their car every weekend, some individuals want to construct their own firearm. So the purpose of selling it is to allow --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, that would be  --I'm sorry, go ahead.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> -- is to assist and provide individuals with material with which they can do that.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, I mean, drilling a hole or two, I would think, doesn't give the same sort of reward that you get from working on your car on the weekends.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Well, I would encourage the Court to read the Vasquez brief. This is not a easy thing necessarily to do and particularly the Press Democrat  article cited there, where the reporter engaged to show how easy this was and, in fact, showed that he couldn't actually do it. He had to engage friends to help him complete this that were expert in firearms. And the -- and even once you have a complete frame, it's not a trivial matter to put that together. There are small parts that have to be put in precise locations. And that reporter, he could not -- he couldn't put it together from the completed frame. So it's not clear that it is a trivial -- it is clearly not a trivial proposition for someone to do this.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Counsel  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> -- I don't know the skills of the particular reporter, but my understanding is, is that it's not terribly difficult for someone to do this, and it's certainly not terribly difficult to take the plastic piece out. That's  --is that part of the gunsmithing?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Well, the plastic rail -- the parts that are blocking the rails in the product that's been highlighted, that has to be taken out. It  --it's recommended that you put it on a drill press vise and use a drill press with a specialized bit to take that away. And Polymer80 explicitly recommends against using against a -- using a Dremel. They say that could damage the product. And I know we don't have any particular product at issue here, but the point is that with -- what Congress said is that we want to regulate the frame or receiver itself. And there's got to be some point, there's going to be a line  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> I guess what I'm  --</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> -- I'm suggesting that if someone who goes through the process of drilling the one or two holes --</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> -- and taking the plastic out, he really wouldn't think that he has built that gun, would he?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> You know, I  --I don't know what that person would think, but I think he would. It's not a simple proposition. Even  the individuals that the government cited that took 21 minutes to put something together wasn't counting the time for the person to acquire the  tools, learn how to use the tools -- this person was a mechanic, so they knew how to do these  things -- or the time to learn how to m achine the object. That person spent two hours watching instructional materials before starting to put that item together. And even after that 21 minutes, the person had done it  incorrectly and it needed to be repaired.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Counsel, I'd like to circle back  --</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> --to Justice Sotomayor's question on  --on (B).</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I -- I -- I -- I take that one position might be it has to be a complete frame or receiver --</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Yes. --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- because there's no indication of ""readily converted"" the way there is in (A).</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. I've got that argument. But I think you've suggested  that, no, we accept that there are incomplete frames or receivers that count. This is indeed an artifact noun.

Patterson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Why wouldn't this be an artifact noun in this statute given (A), which does suggest incomplete things can count;  (C), you know, mufflers and silencers; (D), other destructive devices which don't have a  traditional receiver?  I think the examples we've been given are umbrella guns and pen guns and things like that. Why wouldn't that be an indication that here, if not throughout the U.S. Code,  Congress was using an artifact noun?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> I would think the inference would be precisely the opposite because Congress put that language specifically into those neighboring statutes, words like ""converted"" or words like ""collections of parts.""  So it would be odd to say that in this particular place where Congress has taken special care to use that sort of language, when Congress wanted that language to be applied to say, well, we're just going to infer that it also applies here, where Congress did not put that language. And I think it could -- again, as I've said, it could wreak havoc with the firearm laws because there are a lot of things that can be readily converted. A  -- a traditional rifle can be converted to a short-barreled rifle in minutes with  --with a hacksaw or by swapping in a shorter barrel. So, if -- this concept, ""readily converted,"" Congress only put it into specific places. And we can see in the machine gun provision Congress said ""readily restored"" instead of ""readily converted.""  So we need to  be very precise here. And in -- and in terms of why we would pick critical machining operations instead of readily converted, if we're looking for evidence of meaning, if we're not going to say it has to be completed, well, one evidence of meaning was what did ATF and the industry, working together over a period of years, arrive at?  And what they arrived at was this critical machining test because it does not pose these same problems as readily converted would potentially with other provisions of the Code, and it also is more consistent with the statute by not importing ""readily"" into a place where Congress chose not to put it.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> But it doesn't appear in the statute. It seems a little made  up, right, the critical machining test?  I mean, your other test, I think, has the problem of pulling a tab off the front and  --and saying, okay, now it's a frame or receiver, but it wasn't before you pulled the tape. But the  critical machining doesn't really come from the statute; it's just sort of a way of allowing for a de minimis exception, right?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Well, I wouldn't say that, Your Honor. And, first, we wouldn't -- even under our primary test, I think it's -- if it's a machine, so, you know, if you think of the sculptor when everything's been sculpted, if something is put on to protect it or something and it just has to be pulled off, I wouldn't call that machining. So I think it's -- once all the holes have been drilled, all the material has been removed that requires tools to remove, that would be our primary test. But then, under the secondary test, so it would come fr om the language of frame or receiver. And I think you would say, okay, this -- 75 is an artifact noun, but then what does that artifact noun mean?  We have to still determine  at what point something is a frame or receiver. And we think the evidence of meaning of the agency and the others in the industry who are very keenly interested in this question,  working it out over a period of years and saying, okay, here is this test that we have come up with, this critical machining test, it's much better attested than ""readily""  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But isn't  --</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> -- in terms of what --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So would yo u say that it's like the ordinary usage?  Now everybody just understands based on long standing practice that this critical machining test is the point at which the frame or receiver</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Correct. And it's not that we're deferring to that, but that's the best evidence we have of what this means.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> In -- in ordinary usage, an object that is created to perform a function may still be called by the name that's attached to that object even if it is not completely functional. Isn't that what this gets at?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> I don't believe that this is what it gets at. And there are two provisions here --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, before you -- MR. PATTERSON:  Oh. Yes.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> -- walk away from that, I mean, let me give you an example.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose I see that my neighbor is restoring a classic car, and -- but he's taken out the  -- some critical parts, and then someone says, well, what is that?  And I -- I might well say, well, that's a 1957 Thunderbird, even though it  -- you couldn't drive it and it would take some work to make it do the thing that it was originally created to do. So isn't that what  --isn't that the essence of your backup argument?  The thing must still be such that one would call it a frame or receiver even if it is not fully ready to be functional as a -- as a frame or receiver at this time?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Yes. Yes. So our primary argument is it would have to be, and so I think  -- you could think of the situation with the car and you ask your neighbor can I borrow your car, and you give him the car with the engine taken out, they would probably say that's not a car. But also the backup, yes, is that at  some point, something is a car even if it can't currently perform that function and  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> So what exactly does this  --does the critical manufacturing -- critical machining test involve?  What does that mean?  Explain it to somebody who -- you know, to a layperson.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Yes. So a frame or receiver is basically the part of a firearm that holds the components that allow a firearm to function, so the firing mechanism, the trigger and such, and the sealing component that makes sure that the barrel is sealed off so that the round goes out of the barrel and the energy from the explosion doesn't go elsewhere. So what the critical machining operations test was is, okay, we're going to focus on the parts of the frame or receiver that either have the holes drilled or material removed that are going to hold those parts, and we're going to see, have those operations been performed or been performed to some degree?  And  if they have, we're going to say that's a frame or receiver. And what's important is that this solves the one hole in the AR-15 lower problem because the critical machining operation for that machine gun receiver would be drilling that final hole. So, until that final hole is drilled or at least indexed, as the government has indicated, that critical machining operation has not taken place. But, if the question is ""readily,"" then it would be hard to see, well, how it could be readily in this context and not readily in the machine gun context.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So you prevented the -- you presented the Court with the critical machining alternative, and you say you have these two alternatives. The agency has presented yet another way of going about this. Do you concede that under a facial challenge like the one that you've brought, your task is actually to demonstrate that your alternatives are the only permissible ones under the statute?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Well, I think it's  -- under a rule of party presentation, we've presented the Court with the alternatives that have occurred to anyone. So I think these are  the best alternatives that have occurred.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So you see the question as what is the best alternative, and the Court is just supposed to say we have three options here, which one do we think the best; the agency didn't pick the best, its rule is stricken?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Well  -- well, I think we actually don't have that  --I think our burden is to show that the agency's is wrong. Maybe we d on't have the right interpretation, but if their interpretation is incorrect, then they're asking the wrong question. As  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But by ""incorrect,"" you mean that they don't have the authority under the statute to reach that, the  -- it's -- it's inconsistent with the statute?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Correct. If ""frame or receiver"" does not include items that may  readily be converted to frames or receivers, then this rule is beyond their authority, regardless of what ""frame or receiver"" does mean. So they've gone beyond their authority. And so, you know, we've prevent  -- presented the Court with two alternatives that we think are better interpretations. But the  key point here is that the agency's interpretation is incorrect.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Do you believe that a weapon that has been disassembled  -- a --a firearm, a gun that was once fully operational, everyone would agree was a firearm, it's disassembled, as sometimes happens, maybe even after a crime, is that still a firearm or no, under your view?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Yes. And for two reasons  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> -- if I can give it. So the first reason is that will have a frame or receiver. So that's what Congress put in the statute to ensure  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> In my hypo --</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> -- that that would be a firearm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- the frame or receiver is not in the box.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Oh, then no.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It's not.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> If you don't have the frame or receiver, then no, it's not a weapon.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay. So all that matters really is (B), the frame or receiver?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Well, that is how the statute is structured. And part of that may be due to statutory history. So before this statute, the definition was ""any weapon that is designed to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive in any part or parts of any such weapon.""  And I think we can --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Well, what's all that language doing in there if all that matters for the purpose of the definition is that it has a frame or receiver?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Well,  I -- and -- and so what I was going to say, Your Honor, is that Congress was working from that background. And they said:  Okay, we're going to alter the definition of (A) to include ""readily convertible weapons""; and we were -- we're going to alter the definition of (B), instead of including ""every part,"" to focus on a particular part, the frame or receiver. And it's the frame  or receiver of any such weapon. So it really could  --so I think that explains, that's why it's structured that way. It's maybe not the most straightforwardly structured statute, but it could be ""the frame or receiver of,"" and then insert (A), instead o f ""any such weapon.""  That's really how the statute is structured, a frame or receiver  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I'm sorry, could you clarify for me what you mean?  Assume that there's all the parts of a gun and  -- a --a weapons kit with all the parts of the gun, but the receiver or the frame has a hole missing. So that's the weapon parts kit.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Right. Right.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Is it your position that under (A), assuming we were to find  --</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- that ""readily convertible"" does include some -- some drilling some holes --</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- et cetera, just like a starter gun, to make it a weapon, would that be covered under (A)?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> I don't think -- I think whether it would be covered would turn on the interpretation of (B).</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ah, now we've got --</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> If the Court accepted our backup argument  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- some  --okay.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> And that critical --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So what you're  -- you're taking out of (B) ""readily convertible,"" and also taking it out of (A)?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> No, we're not taking it out of (A), because -- and it's because of what (A) was meant to cover. And that is the starter guns that practically were guns. They had handgun frames  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You have no  --</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> -- but the barrel had to be --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You have no quarrel with the proposition that the agency can, within whatever the statute limits it to do, to determine what makes a completed or nearly -- or  --a -- a completed frame or receiver?</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> I'm not sure I understand the question. But we have no quarrel, as the alternative with we've presented, with the critical machining test and the hypothetical Your Honor presented with a single hole  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>Peter A. Patterson</speaker><text> -- that likely would meet that test.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Anything further?  Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, General?</text>"
3,2024.23-980-t01,"<speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Ninth Circuit has adopted an outlying rule that threatens to create a sweeping regime of securities liability for omissions. The Ninth Circuit held that a risk disclosure can be misleading  simply because a company does not disclose that the specified triggering event for the risk had occurred in the past. That holding was incorrect. A risk disclosure warrants that a type of event may cause harm in the future. It usually makes no representation that the event had never previously occurred. The Ninth Circuit's approach would trigger serious concerns about over-disclosure and fraud by hindsight, and this Court should reject it. Instead, the Court should adopt a similar approach to the one it took for statements of opinion in Omnicare. There, the Court held that statements of opinion were  ordinarily not actionable as false statements, but the Court recognized that a statement of opinion could be misleading based on an embedded representation about how the speaker formed the opinion. So too here, depending on the content of the statement, a forward-looking risk disclosure can be misleading based on an embedded premise about the current state of affairs. But just as a statement that the road may be flooded if it rains cannot be misleading simply because it rained yesterday, a typical risk disclosure cannot be misleading simply because the triggering event had occurred in the past. Under the correct approach, this case is an easy one. Meta's warnings that business harm could result in the event of data misuse did not imply that Meta had never previously suffered such misuse. But, in any event, the  initial misuse of the data had been publicly reported by the time Meta made the statements at  issue, and Respondents have abandoned any claim based on the continued misuse of the data. And  far from being virtually certain to cause a risk of harm to Meta's business, the initial misuse of the data did not result in any harm when it was publicly reported. Under any approach other than the Ninth Circuit's, Petitioners are entitled to prevail. The judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> We will hear argument this morning in Case 23-980, Facebook versus Amalgamated Bank.

I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But the --this is -- this case isn't about harm at this stage, is it?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> So the risk disclosure in this case, Justice Thomas, warned about harm, harm to Me ta's business or reputation.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought the  -- the district court only focused on falsity or misleading -- whether or not this was false or misleading.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Oh, that is correct. So this is not about injury to the plaintiffs or any of the other elements. This is about the element of falsity. Our point is simply that when you look at what this risk disclosure is warning about, it is warning about  harm to business or reputation.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Well, but the problem is that the  -- a reasonable person could look at the statement and assume that because it only talks about future probabilities of  -- of this harm or this event occurring, that it never occurred. It's not  -- and there, you also have another 105 statement in which you do discuss past events. So why wouldn't one be able to read this and assume that it never happened?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Sure. So a couple points in response to that, Justice Thomas. The first is that we don't think that a reasonable person would draw that inference from a statement of this variety. Where a statement says, if something occurs, harm may follow from that, I don't think it's a necessary premise of that statement that the event has never occurred. And yet, that is the implication of Respondents' and the government's position, subject only to the caveat that if the  omitted information is immaterial, which is, of course, a separate element, it would not qualify. Now I do want to say one other thing in response to your question, which is that the context matters. This Court has made clear, most recently in Omnicare, that when you apply the reasonable investor standard, you assume that the reasonable investor is aware of the context, the regulatory framework, and so forth. As we explain in our brief, these Item 105 disclosures serve a very specific purpose. They warn about the types of risks that a particular company will face in the future so that investors are on notice of the types of issues that the company might face.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Why would you includ e in your 105 a past statement?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> So I think Item 105 disclosures can include references to past events, and, of course, where those references are incorrect, you can have a claim for the statement being false or misleading. But, to the extent that my friends on the other side and particularly the government point to the fact that there are certain examples given of breaches that have taken place in the past, we don't think that any negative inference can be drawn from that about the  particular type of episode that occurred here. We think that those disclosures connote breadth. They convey that there are many types of ways in which parties can access data improperly. And, again, the whole point of this disclosure is to put investors on notice that this may happen in the future. And I would add --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, let's  --</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> -- one other contextual point if I could make it very quickly, which is that it's important to keep in mind that at the very beginning of the 10-K, at Joint Appendix 410, Meta warns that statements that include words like ""may"" are intended to identify forward -looking statements.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So if I could give you a hypothetical, and it's a modified version of one of the hypotheticals that is in the briefs. If I say to you a fire occurs at our production plant, our ability to meet our  production and sales targets could be impaired, all right, and, in fact, there had been a significant fire at the production plant, completely destroying it, where does that  -- how does that come out on your view?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> So I think, if there were no longer a production plant by virtue of the fire, that you would be contravening an implied premise of the statement, which is that the production --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So that's what I understood your brief to say, so I'm not  --</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- surprised by that. So what if instead there was a fire and it destroyed 50 percent of the production capacity of the plant?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> So I would say no misrepresentation in that instance, and let me explain why. I think that the difference is that there is no implied representation that there have not been fires at the plant in the past. I think the only implied representation is that there is a plant. Now you can change the language --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, I -- I think that that -- that's not really the way we communicate. I mean, if you think of the  typical investor and you say in the first version of the hypothetical, yes, the typical investor would think it's kind of misleading for you to make this statement that's framed entirely in a hypothetical if, in fact, there's no more plant and no more production capacity, so too the reasonable investor is going to say, well, if there's been such substantial damage to a plant that production capacity is operating at 50 percent or 30 percent or 10 percent, you know, that too is going to be of interest to the investor for the exact same reason. And I guess what that suggests to me is that this inquiry is more contextual than your position allows for.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Well, I think, as I indicated at the outset, that our position is the one that is sensitive to context. The wording of the statement really matters because, after all, as the Court indicated in the opinion in Omnicare, when you're engaged in this analysis, you are looking closely, if necessary,  at both the language of the statement and the context. I -- and I recognize that your hypothetical gets very close to the actual edge case because you could posit an example where the factory has been so greatly damaged that it is as if the factory doesn't exist.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it was meant to be a hard hypothetical.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Well, I --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I grant you that. But I think you could come up with a lot of those, where there's not an embedded statement of the kind that you're saying is necessary. It's like, you know, we said there's a plant and there's not a plant. It's not a black-and-white thing in that, but  -- but it is clearly misleading. And -- and when we think about these questions, we're not looking only to lies, right, or to, you know, complete false statements. We're also looking to misleading statements or misleading omissions as the case may be. And this seems  --you know, the hypothetical is meant to suggest that there are  a range of ways in which these forward-looking statements can be misleading as to things that have occurred in the past.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> And I actually completely agree with that, and I think that our approach takes account of that context. It does  require scrutiny of the statement. I would submit that the other side's approach does not. And  --and let me at least describe what I understand the other side's approach to be, and Mr. Russell and Mr. Barber can explain if I'm incorrect about this. I understand their position to be that whenever you have an if/then statement of this variety, which is a pretty paradigmatic form of statement in a risk disclosure, that the ""if"" carries with it an implied representation that the specified triggering event has not previously occurred, subject only to the caveat that it has to be material. Now let me explain why I think that can't be right with a tangible example. If you take a look at Meta's 10-K and the risk disclosures in that 10 -K, which are voluminous, on page 441, the risk disclosure states that: Unfavorable media coverage could negatively  affect our business. And that is the equivalent of an if/then statement:  If we suffer unfavorable media coverage, that could negatively affect our business. I don't think anyone would infer from that that Meta has never previously suffered unfavorable media coverage. And, if you read the entirety of the risk disclosures, it's sort of replete with examples like that.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Mr. Shanmugam, I  -- I guess what concerns me a little bit is I don't know if your position is appreciating the fact that past occurrences, past triggering events, can still lead to future harm and that what is misleading is the suggestion, when you make your statement completely futuristic, that no such future harm is going to occur. So let me give you an example that I hope will clarify this. So suppose a realtor is speaking to a potential buyer about a house -- and I think there was some house examples in your briefing -- and he says:  If crime goes up in this area, homeowners insurance could become more expensive. The triggering event would be crime, and the harm would be more expensive homeowners insurance. Both of those things in the  futuristic statement are happening in the future. Wouldn't it be misleading to make this statement if a string of burglaries had actually happened that month?  The homeowner has no way of knowing that. The realtor knows that. And, at the time the statement is made, homeowners insurance has actually already shot up two times higher than before. What I'm suggesting is it's misleading because the homeowner is making a determination of the risk of buying this property and paying a certain amount of homeowners insurance. And, when you say your statement totally futuristically, as though that has  --the burglaries never happened, they're miscalculating. They're being misled into making that calculation.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Justice Jackson, I would make three points in response to that. The first is that I don't think that that statement would be misleading because I think you have to parse carefully the language of the statement. And I think, if somebody  says, if crime goes up, some consequence could occur, I think the natural implication of that is if crime goes up from where it is now. But that having been said, I want to acknowledge, I think  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, I mean, isn't the whole point -- the whole point of these risk disclosure statements, as I think you admitted, is that the person who is hearing them is trying to determine whether there's going to be a future harm to their business investment, right?  I mean, isn't that what they're doing?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> I would slightly disagree with that. I think the point of these risk disclosures, as the SEC itself has made clear, is to warn prospectively about the types of risks that a company would face. And a perverse consequence of the other side's approach here is that a company could effectively penalize --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why?  Why -- but can I just ask you why?  Why are you warning about the types of risks?  Isn't it because the  investor is trying to determine that if any of those risks happen, it's going to be a problem for the investment?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Yes, but a company is not ordinarily making any warranty about the  probability of the risk occurring. And the way in which these statements are framed really bears that out. Now I do want to acknowledge something that I think is underlying your hypothetical and was also underlying Justice Kagan's hypothetical. In many of these cases, the omitted information is something that an investor might like to know. I think we would acknowledge that in these hypotheticals, the omitted information may be material. But the problem with the other side's approach is that it really conflates materiality with falsity, and while both of those elements start from a reasonable investor, they measure very different things. Materiality focuses on the omitted  information, whether it is something that in this Court's words would be important to an investor's decision about whether or not to invest. I think the falsity or material  --or misleadingness inquiry focuses on the statement itself:  What does the statement connote is --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> What  --what other disclosure requirements are out there about past events that are relevant to assessing this?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Well, there are many, many. And I do think that this Court can write an opinion that sort of draws a square around Item 105 disclosures because, while those are intended to be forward -looking, to warn about types of risks, you have Item 101, which requires a description of the business, you have Item 106, which is a very specific and recent item included in Regulation S-K to warn about cybersecurity events, and you also have Item 303, which this Court is well familiar with from the Macquarie case last spring, which is the Management Discussion & Analysis section, which requires broad disclosures about known trends and uncertainties. And I would further add --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> So, on the 50 percent hypothetical, if the 50 -- 50 percent of the plant capacity's been destroyed in the past, is there a -- a disclosure requirement that could encompass that that's separate  from the one before us?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> I think it could be relevant to, for instance, the description of the business if the company talks about its facilities there. And a company also has a requirement to update, under Form 8-K, when there have been material changes to the company's business. There are a panoply of these requirements, but we rely on them really simply to make the point that if the SEC ever judges that there needs to be explicit disclosures about a particular type of past or present event, the SEC has the power to promulgate all necessary and appropriate disclosure requirements.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> That's what I  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Mr. Shanmugam --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> -- I'm having a little trouble with the question I think you're -- you're actually addressing in terms of  the relationship between 105 and the rest of it. I mean, is your position basically that:  Don't worry about half-truths under 105 because the basic problem is already going to be disclosed under other provisions?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> That isn't our submission, Mr. Chief Justice. We certainly acknowledge that there can be circumstances in which even Item 105 disclosures can be misleading. And we agree on many of the hypotheticals that Respondents and the government set out in their briefs, primarily because those are statements that contain implied representations of one sort or another. I simply want to make the point that I think the great risk of accepting Respondents' and the government's approach and upholding the Ninth Circuit's decision, which, again, is an outlier in that it requires disclosure of previous occurrences of the triggering event without any assessment of how likely the risk is to occur, I think the great danger is that it would really convert these disclosures, which, again, identify types of risks th at companies face, into disclosures of laundry lists of past  occurrences, which companies would presumably --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counselor --</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> -- have to keep updating.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- you keep accusing the Ninth Circuit of an absolute rule, but I'm hearing your absolute rule. Your absolute rule is -- or categorical rule, you say it in your brief at page 19:  ""Risk disclosures under 105 make no implied representation about a company's past experiences.""  Later, you say:  ""Forward-looking risk disclosures do not make any implied assertion about previous events and the present risk of harm they create.""  So you're  -- you want a different categorical rule. You say it's contextual, but the only context you're looking at is whether there's a misrepresentation, not a misleading representation. I think that's the question that Justice Kagan was asking you. If you take it out  --you're -- you're shaking your head yes. You're saying it has to be an explicit or implicit misrepresentation. But there's no such thing as having a m isleading represent -- misrepresentation with risk disclosures. Isn't that what you're arguing?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> So, Justice Sotomayor, I think no litigant before this Court likes to be accused of having a categorical rule, but let me explain to you  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, but you're smiling because I think that's what you want.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> No. I don't -- I -- I think we want a rule that goes like this. I think, when you have a bare if/then statement like the statements at issue here, which essentially boil down to the proposition, if there is an episode of data misuse, Facebook may suffer harm to its business or reputation, then, in that circumstance, there is no implied representation without more about whether or not data misuse has occurred in the past. It is no different from the adverse publicity example from the 10-K or any number of other examples. But  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Could I stop you there?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right. Let's go to these statements, okay?  I'm going to  start with the one that says:  If third parties or developers fail to adopt adequate data security practices, something could happen in  the future. But that misleading statement is omitting the critical information that Meta had failed to implement adequate practices to prevent third parties from misusing its data. It had already happened. A third party had disclosed it, failed to disclose how many millions of  -- of user information?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> It's alleged to be around 30 million  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And failed  --</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> -- which was in the Guardian article.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and failed to destroy those records, as it represented it had. So why isn't that a misleading statement?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> So several points in response to that, Justice Sotomayor, and I think it's telling that when you look at Respondents' and the government's brief, they don't even  really try to identify the statements that are at issue here. They just want to talk about why the omitted information matters. Let's leave that aside. I'm happy to join issue on the statements here. The  statement you're referring to, which is at the bottom of page 10 of our opening brief, is identified as Statement 24 in the complaint. I don't think that the claim --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I don't want to look at the statements -- I've read the statement the way it was stated. Let's go back to my point. Why isn't it misleading that ther e were no mechanisms by the third party, as you state, if they have inadequate mechanisms, X is going to happen?  We know there isn't any because Facebook didn't put any in.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> So I actually don't think that that is the claim the plaintiffs have been pursuing. I think that their claim is that the app developer here did not develop sufficient safeguards.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Why isn't that misleading?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> I think the reason that that is not misleading is because there is no representation here about what has taken place in the past. That statement, no less than  the other statements on which they rely, is forward-looking.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Just as  --</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Now it differs in one respec t in that it doesn't identify specifically harm to business or reputation, but the fundamental problem with plaintiffs' theory as to this statement is that the episode of data misuse that they're complaining about was in the public domain at the time. So their claim has to be --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That has to go  --</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> -- something more than that.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- to materiality. That's a different issue. That's not what we granted cert on.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Well, they can't possibly pursue a claim in a case where the alleged omitted information was in the public  domain, whether you locate that in the materiality element or somewhere else. And  that's precisely why their claim has to be that our statement had to contain something more than simply a disclosure about the data misuse that was already in the public domain. And my question for the other side is: What is the something more that they think this statement should have contained that was not already in the public domain at that time?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Mr. Shanmugam, I just want to see if I've got it, okay, where you're coming from at least, okay?  A highly reticulated regulatory system, Item 105 is about risk factors and it's necessarily forward-looking. Companies typically do if/then statements. That's generally okay, you would say. Like opinions, got it, Omnicare. Unless there's some sort of affirmative representation about a fact in the world that's wrong. Is that the gist of your view?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> It is. And to pick up on Justice Sotomayor's --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And  --and let me  -- let me just continue before you pivot back to Justice Sotomayor, which I want you to do too, but the  -- to take Justice Kagan's hypothetical, which we're all concerned about, right, the  50 percent, would that be in your view possibly required by other provisions like Item 101, which requires information material to an  understanding of the general development of the business?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And  --</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> It could be  already required. And if it isn't --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And  --</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> -- the SEC could --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And Item 303, which requires a disclosure of known trends or uncertainties that have had or that are reasonably likely to have a material impact?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Yes, it -- it could be required by Item 303 as well.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And 106 as well, which is specific to cybersecurity problems?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Yes, but doesn't, I think, by everyone's admission, sweep as broadly as to cover what took place here.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> But we don't have any of those provisions before us. This is a 105.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> It is. And I do think that the Court could write an opinion that makes clear that the context here is a limiting factor on the rule, which is to say that precisely because Item 105 disclosures are forward-looking, a reasonable investor, familiar with that regulatory framework, would understand that, as Meta warned here, these statements make no representations about the past. And I do think  --and the reason I wanted to pivot to Justice Sotomayor  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Pivot -- pivot away.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> -- was just to add the important caveat that you can change this statement pretty easily to render it misleading. If the statement had said Meta has never experienced an episode of data misuse involving its users, but if it did, it would do harm to Meta's business or reputation, of course, in that context, the statement would be false or misleading if there had been an episode in the past. And I do want to say that the Court took this case to resolve a circuit conflict here, and there are basically sort of three options. Our view is that a statement of this variety, as Justice Gorsuch just set out, is ordinarily forward-looking, the condition does not ordinarily contain an implied representation about what took place in the past. The Ninth Circuit went all the way in the other direction and the Ninth Circuit said, if a triggering event has taken place in the past, the statement can be false or misleading regardless of whether or not the risk has materialized. The circuits in the middle say that if the risk is certain or virtually certain to occur, a statement can be false or misleading in that circumstance. On these facts, we woul d not be liable even under that test, which was essentially the preexisting test in the Ninth Circuit before the court relaxed it.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You  said that the risk factors are necessarily forward-looking. Is that a regulatory or a statutory requirement?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> So I think that the regulation makes quite clear that what you are warning about is factors that could render the  company's -- an investment in the company speculative or risky. That is in the language of Item 105 itself. Now that having been said, there can be circumstances in which a company could include in an Item 105 disclosure something about the past or present state of affairs. And the government points to the fact that there was a time when an earlier version of Item 105 required at least some disclosures of that variety. That's all well and good. As I indicated in response to Justices Gorsuch and Sotomayor, a company could choose to do that and run the risk of being held liable. My point is simply that if a company does not do that in the statement at issue, it cannot be liable for securities fraud based on some categorical implied representation that the specified event had never occurred in the past.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, isn't it the case that an evaluation of risks is always forward-looking?  Isn't it inherently forward-looking?  When you want to know about what risk you face, you want to know what y our risk is in the future, right?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> It is, and that is essentially what underlies our argument here. I would submit that where I think the Ninth Circuit sort of went off the rails a little bit is that it seemed to conflate the risk of the ultimate harm with the risk of the conditional triggering event occurring.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, I think the -- the intuition is that a statement that simply blandly says that there's a possibility of a risk can, in context, be extremely misleading if there is a high probability of the risk materializing. I think that is the intuition. The fact that something has happened in the past very often sheds light on the risk of a recurrence. If you analyze the reason why the thing happened in the past, you may realize that this reason persists and, therefore, it's  predictable that the same thing may happen in the past. But the mere fact that something happened in the past doesn't necessarily tell you what the risk is going forward. Do you disagree with any of that?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Well, Justice Alito, I think that that is the intuition that supports the circuits that have adopted the so-called virtual certainty rule, the notion that if you warn that a risk is possible, but, in fact, the harm is certain or almost certain to materialize, that there comes a point at which it feels as if the statement is misleading. Now, here, precisely because we know that no harm occurred from the initial misuse of the data by Cambridge Analytica, this is an easy case even under that standard.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, what if --</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> But --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Let's take the  -- the hypothetical about the -- the risk of a fire, and let's say that there was a fire, it was a damaging fire, and an analysis of the reason why the fire started was that all the wiring in the plant is obsolete and eventually has to be replaced, but it can't be replaced for the next six months. So it shows there that there's a -- a substantial risk of the recurrence of a fire. On the other hand, if there was a fire and it was caused by the fact that the factory was hit by a piece of space junk that fell out of the sky, the fact that that happened doesn't really tell you much more about the probability that you're going to have another fire based on objects falling out of space. So what do we do with that situation?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> So I would say two things about that situation. The first is that if you have a statement that simply says, you know, there may be a risk of a fire occurring at our facility, I don't think that that statement would be misleading simply because there's a modest difference in -- a modest increase in the probability of that happening because of some factor or another. I think the circuits that have adopted the certainty or virtual certainty standard have done so precisely because all you're saying is there's a possibility of this happening. If  there is a certainty of it happening, then the statement starts to feel misleading. But the other thing I would say  -- and, again, I think this is very important -- is that here, we're talking about these sorts of if/then statements. If something occurs, then there may be harm to the company's business or reputation. What you're really warning about in that circumstance, I would submit, is the ultimate harm to business or reputation. So, if you're applying a standard like the virtual certainty standard, you know, I think the argument that th e other side is making is: Well, if you had an episode of data misuse and you were aware of it at the time, that, you know, if it is highly likely that there is going to be harm to your business, then that statement is misleading.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> And the problem is that that doesn't work out on these facts.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?  No?  Justice Kagan?</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So this is very much meant to follow up on Justice Alito's questions. My -- my -- my first note is that in this statement, Facebook actually does have various kinds of statements about what has  happened in the past. It doesn't talk about Cambridge Analytica, but it does talk about other things. It says there have been hacking incidents in the past. Hacking is a real problem, and we've experienced it. And, you know, if you had left that out, I think that you would have every right to stand up there and say:  Like, who could really think that our statement says that there aren't hacking incidents in the past?  All right?  So you put in a bunch of stuff that nobody could accuse you of just take -- you know, omitting because who could think that?  But now say that there's an extraordinary release of confidential data, and let's make it even more extraordinary in this case because, if we make it this case, you know, you'll tell me this was known already and it really wasn't so bad. But, you know, just imagine that -- that every user of Facebook had all their confidential data released in some way to a third party, who then put it on the open market. So, really, quite an extraordinary mishap. And just as Justice Alito says, the reason why people want to know about that in assessing risks going forward is because it says something about the company's vulnerabilities. It might say something about operational problems of the company. It might say something about management issues at the company, like: How does a company allow that to happen?  I better go find out. So -- so why wouldn't that be required here?  Whatever anything else requires, what  -- you know, what -- whatever other requirements there are, this requirement, which talks about -- which is supposed to give people an understanding of future risks, an investor needs to know that, doesn't she?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Yeah. So I would say two things in response to that, Justice Kagan. The first is that, again, with regard to the examples that were given, I think we  would acknowledge that there could be a case in which you might draw a negative inference from  something that a company said about what took place in the past. Again, it's a contextual analysis that depends on the nature of the statements. But, here, I think it's quite clear that the examples that were being given were precisely that. They were examples of the types of efforts improperly to obtain Facebook user data that had occurred in the past. And a reasonable investor, I would submit, would not have been misled by that to believe that no third party had ever gained access to user data or misused that data through other means. But, second, to respond to the second half of your question, of course, there could be situations in which omitted information would really be of interest to a reasonable investor. That goes to materiality. And yet, it is a fundamental principle that this Court has articulated in cases like Matrixx and Macquarie that that is not enough at least for 10-B liability, where there cannot be pure omissions liability. There is pure omissions liability under other provisions of  the securities laws but not 10 -B, which is, of course, enforceable by private investors. And what is the problem that this Court would be creating if it went as far as the Ninth Circuit?  It would be the problem of creating a regime where a company would be penalized for disclosing about the very risk that eventually materializes.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Just to  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Thank you, Chief. Mr. Shanmugam, so you would agree, though, an if/then statement can be misleading and materially possibly so if it understates the risk going forward, the probability of it?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> I think only under the virtual certainty standard --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> -- but not under the standard  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Do you object to that?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> -- we are advancing.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I -- I -- I got that.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> I think, under that standard  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Do we need to decide the difference between what you're advocating and the virtual certainty -- what you're calling the virtual certainty standard?  Is that necessary to a decision here?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> I think that this Court could write an opinion that says simply that the Ninth Circuit's rule, as we understand it and as the Ninth Circuit set out at pages 24A and 25A of the Petition Appendix, cannot be correct, that it cannot be sufficient to render a statement misleading simply that the pre -- the specified triggering event has previously occurred in the past, without an assessment of the risk of harm. The other side comes back and says: Well, it's implicit that if it's immaterial, that it would fall outside that rule. But our submission is that's not what the Ninth Circuit was really doing here. The Ninth Circuit was just saying:  If you have a previous occurrence,  the falsity requirement is satisfied. The Court could leave for another day the delta between our proposed test and the virtual certainty test because I think the  virtual certainty test creates an exception in circumstances where, again, the risk of harm is certain or virtually certain to materialize. Defendants often prevail under that standard. We certainly think this Court should ideally provide guidance and resolve the circuit conflict here definitively. But, if the Court wanted to say, we're not going to decide between those two standards, it just doesn't matter on these facts.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> A couple questions. On the risk factors, as I understand it, you don't have to identify the probability of the event occ urring, correct?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> And companies typically don't. If a company said it is highly unlikely that an episode of data misuse is going  to materialize, then all of these things would be put into play. Perhaps not surprisingly, companies don't make warranties of that variety.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Because, if they did that and, as Justice Gorsuch said, they understated the risks, then they would be  --</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Correct. In Justice Alito's hypothetical, if you included language that goes to how probable it is, then you're going to have a problem if you have information that goes to that probability.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Right. And, second, the SEC, I think you're acknowledging, could adopt a regulation that says what it currently says about risk factors and added:  And, by the way, if you're identifying possible future events that could create harm, you also need to identify if those events have occurred in the past?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> And what's funny about this, Justice Kavanaugh  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Is that a ""yes""?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> And the SEC did not do that when it promulgated Item 106 just last year. It did not include episodes of data misuse in what had to be disclosed. And, indeed, the SEC shied away from requiring elaborate disclosures about previous occurrences precisely because companies complained about the  burden that that would impose.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So, Mr. Shanmugam, you said that this is about context and about the regulatory context, but it seems to me, based on a lot of the hypothetica ls that you've gotten and the ones written in the briefs, that it's about more than just the regulatory context but also about the context of the business, the nature of the risk,  et cetera, which makes it not easily susceptible to a categorical rule. Let's just say  --you know, Justice Gorsuch was asking you to kind of articulate where the line might be. It's hard for me to see why we would adopt the virtual certainty test when it's nobody's first choice. And it seems like the kind of bright -- bright -line rule that maybe the SEC might want to adopt,  that sort of thing, but it's hard for me to see why we would do that. Assume that I think the Ninth Circuit's rule goes too far and I think your rule goes too far. It seems to me very hard to articulate what the line is. And -- and -- and  maybe I can put it this way. It seems like the hardest hypotheticals are the ones where the risks are either unusual or devastating, like a 50 percent loss of a factory because of a fire or getting hit by space junk. Those are  -- those are things that are unusual and hard. You know, nobody would think that a social media company wouldn't be at ris k of data breaches or that data breaches hadn't happened in the past. Or, if you're a food supply chain, you know, E. coli outbreaks in spinach, you know, that sort of thing. If things are going to recur and they're things you associate with the business and they're described at a relatively high level of generality, it seems to me that those kinds of statements, well, maybe those do seem like they're general statements just about the category of risk that a particular kind of business faces, but if they are more unusual, kind of either/or binary choices, make or break the business, well, then those really seem like they're misleading. So, if I see it that way, how do I articulate a rule that handles anything more than the case in front of us?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Sure.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Maybe I shouldn't.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Well, Justice Barrett, I think what I would say is that I would grant that I think there are circumstances in which a reasonable investor may have an intuition that something has taken place in the past. The example that I gave earlier, I think, falls into that category. Nobody would t hink that a company as big as Meta had never suffered unfavorable publicity. And I would submit that if we're talking about data misuse and the like, I think most people would assume that there have been episodes of that variety in the past. I think what you may be reacting to here is the sense that sometimes there are events that seem so significant that it feels as if there ought to be an obligation to disclose them, and maybe the unusual events  fall into that category because those are perhaps likely to be events that are really, really significant. Our point is simply that that goes to materiality first and foremost. And, again, I think part of the problem with the other side's  approach is that it really conflates these elements that are meant to be different. The language of Rule 10b-5 itself makes clear that an omission has to be both material on its own terms and necessary in order to avoid rendering a statement not misleading.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Well, I think some of the hypotheticals that you're getting show that not everybody shares that intuition, that materiality is the only thing at stake, that it can also be misleading. Depending on how specific the risk is, you know, people probably have different intuitions that fall along a spectrum. So what -- if -- if I'm resisting, I feel like you're still advocating for your categorical rule.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Well  --but, all right, so let me offer the important caveat, which is where I started the argument, which is the caveat that we really drew from this Court's opinion in Omnicare, which is that implied representations, I think, can take care of many of these circumstances. And we acknowledge in our reply brief that, for instance, a  statement can have an implied representation about the current state of affairs. Take the final exam example. If I fail one of my finals this semester, I may have to retake a class. I think, there, there's an implied representation that you're talking about your finals this semester, and if you failed one of them, that statement is then false or misleading. It is because there is an implied representation that we think is absent from a statement of this variety. And I think the Court can write an opinion that is mindful of the language of this statement but recognizing that the reason that there's a circuit conflict is that companies use this form of formulation quite frequently. And so, in some sense, the Court is deciding it for a category of types of statements, but, if the wording changes, the analysis is going to be different.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So I have two questions that are kind of similar. I think  that what is bugging me about your view is that you seem to suggest that the only implied misrepresentation or implied representation that matters is a statement that falsely suggests that something didn't happen in the past when it actually did. You've said that many times. But I'm wondering  whether there isn't also a statement about what needs to happen in the future from the investor's perspective so that when you say, if this kind of data breach happens, it could damage Facebook's business, the investor thinks, okay, so if I invest in this business now, I'm going to have to start looking out for signs of this kind of data breach happening in the future, I'm going to be focused on that aspect of, you know, the research as I try to figure out this investment. You're sort of throwing him off t he scent of the fact that what he really needs to do is figure out what harms are going to arise from the data breach that has already occurred. This is similar to Justice Kagan's point about how an investor uses the information. They're  looking for vulnerabilities in the company, et cetera. And so I'm just -- I'm just nervous about the suggestion that the only  representation that's being made in a futuristic statement is one that relates to the past as opposed to a possible statement about the future in the way that I've described.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> So I'd make two points about that, Justice Jackson. The first is that I think it's important to look at Item 105, and one of the things that Item 105 requires is that the risk that you're disclosing be a material risk; in other words, it's got to be something that is reasonably likely to arise. And so I actually think, if you had, for instance, the example of our factory being hit by a meteor, that's something that you would probably not have to disclose.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, but it's already occurred. In  -- in the --</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- in all the hypotheticals that I'm talking about  --</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- it's a hundred percent, let's say, that this is -- that there's going to be harm from this because it's happened.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> And in some sense, my point is that precisely because it has to be material, I think a reasonable investor would think this is something that is a very real risk, it may have happened in the past, it could happen in the future. And  -- and I think that that is an important  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, I guess my question is, why aren't you making a statement with your purely futuristic formulation that leads the reasonable investor to believe that no harm of this nature is going to happen right -- right now, right now?</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Right. Well  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I have to wait -- that the  --so, in my -- in my real estate example, the person is -- when the -- when the real estate agent says, if crime goes up, home insurance rates might go up, the investor says, okay, I'm going to start looking at crime  reports because, you know, if this were to happen in the future, then, fine, this risk will materialize. What he doesn't know is that crime  has already gone up, crime has already gone up, and that, really, tomorrow the insurance rates are going to go up. And what I'm suggesting is that you've misled him into thinking that he has to wait for a future triggering event as opposed to he has to do what he needs to to mitigate the harm that will already happen as a result of the past triggering event.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Yes. And I think we would draw a line between a circumstance in which the harm has currently materialized, in other words, the harm is ongoing and, therefore, will exist in the future, and a circumstance in which there is simply a present risk of harm, whether from a past event or a future event. I think, if there is merely a risk, there would be no liability because that risk is precisely what you're warning of, and you're not  making any warranty about whether the triggering event has occurred in the past. And the last thing I would say is that I really do think it's a question for my friends on the other side what they think the statement here should have said because it seems clear that they think it should have said something  more than that there was the initial episode of misuse, which was already in the public domain. And I think that the answer to that question will point up just how expansive and broad the implied representation, really, the warranty, is  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> --that they think every statement includes.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Mr. Russell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL</text>","<speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start by making clear our position. First, as to the actual question presented, we agree that a risk disclosure is not misleading because it omits disclosure of an event that is immaterial because it risks no  business harm. The Ninth Circuit did not hold otherwise. Second, we agree that in addition to proving materiality, plaintiffs must also show  that the risk statement implies that the omitted event did not occur. We don't claim that every risk statement includes that implication. Our position is simply that they can and frequently do, and that ultimately depends on the facts and context of each case. Third, for that reason, the Court should reject Facebook's categorical rule that Item 105 statements are always agnostic about whether the risk has transpired in the past. Facebook admits that if a student tells his parents that there's a risk he may fail an exam when he's already done so, that is misleading because it implies it's impossible that he won't when that isn't true. The same is true of many risk factor statements, including the ones at issue in this case stating that the  -- describing an improper disclosure of user data as a hypothetical risk implied that it was possible it wouldn't occur. And that wasn't  possible because it already had. This does not mean that issuers must disclose every material occurrence of a risk. They simply must say enough to remove the false impression that the omitted event has not yet materialized, something they generally can do, as Facebook did here with respect to hacking, by simply acknowledging that the risk has materialized in the past. Finally, the Ninth Circuit did not adopt any contrary categorical rule. The Court did not discuss whether these particular statements were agnostic about the past because Facebook never argued that they were. It elected instead to argue only that the warned-of risks had not transpired because it viewed the warned -of risks as speaking only to hacking events and business harm. Because Facebook does not challenge the Ninth Circuit's fact-bound rejection of those claims in this Court, this Court should provide any necessary guidance for future cases in the course of affirming the judgment. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start by making clear our position.

I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Mr. Russell, what else should Facebook have provided in the 105 statement to comply with 10b?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> So I think that they could have said what they said and then said  something like:  Such improper disclosure or misuse of user data has occurred in the past, including recently on a substantial scale. I think that would have removed any misimpression that an event like what happened in Cambridge Analytica hadn't occurred. And the reason that it is reasonable for somebody to think that this statement implies that it hadn't occurred is because an investor  --a reasonable investor hearing a company describe factors that are relevant, factors that make the investment risky would expect that if something like this had happened, 30 million users' private data released, eventually causing a hundred billion dollar reduction in the market capitalization of the company, that the company who is intent on telling the whole truth about the factors that make the investment risky would not speak about such things  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Mr. Russell --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Counsel  --</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> --in hypothetical terms.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I'm sorry, Chief.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Oh, yeah. Your basic submission is that a probabilistic statement about something carries the inference that  --that something has not occurred.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> No. Our  -- our position is that it can. It doesn't always.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. Well, it  -- it can.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> But, I mean, with respect to certainly some but maybe most, a probabilistic statement will do the exact opposite. For example, if you're leaving my house and I say, you might slip on the steps, you wouldn't say, well, that's never happened before.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> That's right.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Your  --your inference would be that has happened and that's  why I'm giving you the warning. And it seems to me, if you're saying it  -- it can go one way in some cases, it can go another way in the other cases, it's a real expansion of the disclosure obligation. In  other words, it's not something that is narrow because, whether it's happened or not, you -- you  -- you -- you have to disclose it.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> No. That's not our --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, exactly  -- well, who -- how are we supposed to parse whether it's slipping on my steps or, you know, what you say is actionable in this case?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> I think you simply have to do what the Court says you have to do in omission cases in Omnicare, which is you always have to ask how would a reasonable person understand the implications of this sentence and frequently -- and if it is a case where somebody would understand that the warned-of risk is something that happens all the time or you'd only be talking about it if it happened in the past. If it's an event like adverse publicity that everybody knows has happened in the past, nobody's going to understand the statement to be implying that it hadn't happened.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So  -- so, Mr. Russell  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> So  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I'm sorry, Chief.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> I was just going to follow up.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> So, basically, if you have this and it's -- the suit is -- is brought, you say:  Well, it  --it either -- the inference it either has happened in the past or it hasn't happened in the past and we're going to go to trial to decide that, it seems to me that's kind of a blank check.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> No, you treat it the way you do every omissions case. You can enter summary judgment or enter a motion to dismiss if no reasonable juror could find that this statement implied that the event hadn't happened in the past. In this case, there are at least four reasons why it would be reasonable for a jury to decide that this particular set of statements did. The first is the structure, which it is the received wisdom of many courts in many  contexts over many years, ""can"" and ""often"" does imply that speaking of something in a  hypothetical term implies that it hasn't happened. But the context of this case reinforces that here because, here, we are not talking about something like adverse publicity, which people would know happens all the time.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Well, Mr. Russell, on that, so  -- so I just want to make sure, there -- there seems to be a -- a point of agreement not only on the question actually presented but that forward -looking risk factor statements don't generally imply anything. There has to be some implied representation about a past fact for you to get in the door. Is  --is that right?  Is that common ground?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> I don't know that I would agree on the ""generally.""  I think we do agree that it's context-dependent, and sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> But it depends upon an implied representation that there is nothing -- no problem in the past?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. We agree on that.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Everybody seems to  -- you guys agree on that at least. What about the statement we have here? I  -- I want some help with that because it -- I wonder whether we're in the  -- the world of a meteorite or  --or Justice Alito's falling debris or whether we're in the Chief Justice's world of slip-and-fall on my front porch. Defendant represented that our industry is prone to cyber attacks. It says that hacking has become more prevalent in our industry, and it says we cannot assure you that the measures we have will provide absolute security. Why isn't this  --given those kinds of warnings, wher e is the implied representation that Meta has never had a significant data breach?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Because Meta itself insisted vehemently below and in public when  this was finally disclosed in 2018 that this was not a hacking event. This was not a cybersecurity event. And the risk disclosures discussed separately the risk of misappropriation of user data by developers, and in that context, it doesn't say any of the things that you just read.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah. Well, that's the next paragraph, and it -- it -- it does say that we provide limited information. However, if they fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices or in the event of a breach of their networks, you're going to have a problem. So, again, where is the implied representation that  -- that this hasn't happened in the past?  Isn't this exactly the sort of thing that a reasonable investor does know can happen to large companies with --</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> I don't  --I respectfully disagree.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I mean, the federal government -- I mean, I -- I think China probably has all of our FBI files. You know, I mean, data breaches are part of our -- our lives these days.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> But this wasn't a data breach. And this is really important. That was  a principal argument that Facebook made below, that these statements only warned about data breaches, and the Ninth Circuit rejected that reading, and the reason for that is because, unlike a hacking event -- and I don't know what China does -- here, Facebook allowed a third-party developer -- it just gave them the data. And that doesn't happen, Justice Barrett, all the time. Actually, at the  -- before the disclosures in this case, reasonable investors would have thought that it never happened and particularly on this scale. And for --Facebook had faced allegations of this in December of 2015, and it didn't respond by saying:  Yeah, that happened and we took care of it. It said:  We have to conduct an investigation, and if we do, we will  take swift action. And by the time they issued this report in 2016, they hadn't said boo about this. And so, in that context, I think it is very reasonable for investors to understand that by treatin g it as simply something that may happen in the future, they are confirming that their -- what their silence had already  conveyed, which is that the  --that we didn't substantiate  the allegations in the 2015 article.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So you're saying that it is unusual because it wasn't  -- you're saying it wasn't a data breach. It was Facebook, Meta just handing over the data. You're saying it falls more in the category of a factory half burning to the ground, something that we wouldn't necessarily expect because you would have trusted Meta not to hand it over. Is that what you're saying?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> That's right. And that's why users were so angry --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And it's handing over the data  --</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> --when they found out about this.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- without any real controls, isn't that right?  Isn't that the allegation?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Right, that this evidence  --this episode showed not only that they had given this away in this one instance but that they didn't have the capability to keep  their promises to users that users can control who has access to their private data.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Mr. Russell, can I just ask you one other question?  You know, Justice Gorsuch and  -- and the Chief too were kind of trying to pin you down on exactly what you think about these if/then statements or these statements of risk, and you agreed that sometimes they might be purely forward-looking, right?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> And you said:  But they can contain implied representations. And -- and I think Mr. Shanmugam's position is that ordinarily they don't. And is yours that they ordinarily do?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> I think that may be a fair representation. That is the received  wisdom from all these courts in all these cases in all these contexts. But, at the end of the day  -- and I'm not sure that it's helpful or necessary to say  whether they ordinarily do or they ordinarily don't. At the end of the day, each case has to be considered on its facts.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, doesn't that raise what for me is a kind of separation of powers or due process concern?  The SEC knows how to write regulations that require disclosure of past events. As we've discussed, they have those kinds of regulations. And what happens here is this regulation does not explicitly require that, and then the question is:  Okay, why not let the SEC do that if they want to?  And then we have this regulation. And you say sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't, in response to Justice Barrett and the Chief, and you said it can sometimes contain an implied representation. If you're the regulated party, you don't have fair notice, one could say, of what you're required to do. It's guesswork about when you're required to disclose. And you're going to therefore  --another problem that they raise, and I just want you to respond to all this  --that you're going to just over-disclose then and that's going to defeat the whole purpose of it. So I guess the starting point is, why not let the SEC do this if they want to?  Isn't there a notice problem when you do it this way? And doesn't that, in turn, lead to over-disclosures, which undermines the whole kind of theory here?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> So I think the premise of the question and a major premise of the other side's argument is that Item 105 is directed at disclosing only things that might happen in the future. And that's just wrong, right?  The text of the stat -- of the regulation says  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> But you  -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just want to get this one point out and you can keep going. A lot of SEC regulations do specifically require disclosure of things in the past, correct?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And --</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> And they also require  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- and this doesn't explicitly do that. Keep going, though. I'm sorry to interrupt.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> That a lot of regulations require things that -- to be disclosed about the past and the future. Most  of them do both. And so I don't think you can draw any inference about what this regulation is intended to do just from that fact. But you can look at the regulatory language, which requires disclosure of factors that make the investment risky. And the fact that there's been a recent misappropriation of 30 million users' private data that is a  ticking time bomb that's going to cause a hundred billion dollars in damages to the company down the line is a factor that makes investment in the company risky.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, that's a  --</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> More --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> -- that is -- that is an argument that seemed to me different from -- seems to me different from the one that I thought was presented by the question. So there can be a situation in which an event has happened in the past, a big data breach, and the company knows that this thing that happened in the past is going to have a continuing effect, that it does not have to  be a recurrence of a similar event. We're talking about the damage from the past event which continues to have an effect. That's different from the situation in which something happened in the past, it's a discrete event, it's over, but there's concern that there's a real risk that it's going to happen in the future.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> I think that's right. I think --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, I thought we were  --we took the case to decide the second question, not this first question that you've -- that  --and that may be the one that fits best with the facts of the case, but I see those two things as quite different.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Well, but I was trying to make the more generic point, that simply that Item 105 is not limited to requiring disclosures about things that may happen in the future. And  you can get that from the regulatory language. You get it from the fact that Facebook itself  disclosed facts, including the prior oc currence of hacking, and it does so and with respect to a bunch of other things. My point is simply that nobody who reads these things, I think, will think that a risk factor statement that expressly discusses past events, that is intended to inform people about factors that make the investment risky, which can occur in past events, who know that the prior versions of the regulation instructed people that gave examples of past events is going to think this is only talking about the future.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Let me give you these two situations. This is what most troubles me about your -- your argument, although, as I -- I tried to bring out in questioning Mr. Shanmugam, I see problems with his as well. Suppose a company  -- let's go back to the fire example. Suppose a company does an internal  --has an inspector come  -- come in. The inspector examines the factory and says your wiring has -- has got to be replaced, but it can't be done in less than six months and that  there is an X percentage chance that there's going to be a fire in your factory in the next year. Do they have to disclose  --if -- and they say in their -- in the 10 -- in answering the 10 -K, if there is a fire, there may be a significant disruption of our operations. Do  they have to disclose that internal report and say we know that there is an X percent chance that a fire is going to occur?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> So I think possibly yes, but this is actually the real virtual certainty rule. So this is where something is misleading not because it's already happened in the past but because you are not disclosing something that's virtually certain to happen in the future.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, it's not virtually certain. There's a certain percentage. Let's say it's a 15 percent chance.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Well, I think, if the statement is understood to imply that there hasn't been a fire in the past, that's our case, that is our claim here, and that that would be misleading without regard --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, the statement  --</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> --to the probability of occurrence.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> -- the statement is, if there is a fire, there will be a substantial disruption of our operations.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> I think, if there has been a fire, that  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> It doesn't say if there has been. If there is a fire.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> No, I understand.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> I understand that, but a reasonable investor, I think, could read that as saying, you know, we wouldn't be talking about fires in hypothetical terms if there had recently been one that calls into question the safety of the entire facility.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If it calls into question the safety of the facility, if the -- the X is high enough, if the probability of it happening is high enough, but if -- if there was a fire in the past because of a meteorite, I mean, that doesn't say anything about the probability  -- it doesn't increase the infinitesimal probability -- infinitesimally low  probability of it happening in the future.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> I think I agree with that. I think that event would probably be  deemed immaterial to investors because it doesn't auger harm to the business going forward.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Well, I'll just  --</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> But that's the opposite of this case.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> -- tell you where this is going and I'll let you go. Unless there's a requirement to say  -- to --to quantify in some way the nature of the risk, whether in numerical terms or in descriptive terms, there's a very high risk, there's a high risk, a moderate risk, whatever, then I don't see the basis  -- I see that to be inconsistent with the idea that the occurrence of an event in the future which highlights the potential for the materialization of the risk in the future has to be disclosed. I don't really see a difference between those two.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Well, I don't think that a company is entitled to mislead people about something that occurred in the past that, under  Basic, would be a material event just because it has an assessment that it's not going to happen again. It's up to the investors to make that  judgment themselves, to value the company based on their own assessment once they are put on notice that this is actually something that happened in the past.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So is that why you're sticking with  --with that -- it has to be a statement that is -- that would cause a listener to infer a fact about the past is untrue?  I mean, I'm sort of with Justice Alito in trying to understand the probability of risk and whether a statement can also be misleading if it would lead to an inference that the risk of future harm is zero or very low when the speaker knows it to be much greater than that. Why isn't that another kind of misleadingness that we should be thinking about or that the SEC was thinking about? </text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> I -- I don't dispute that that is another kind of harm and another way in which a statement could be misleading. I'm simply saying this case is not about that. Our theory of liability is that this monumentally important event happened in the past and Facebook misled people into thinking that it hadn't.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I'm very confused. I thought, when Justice Alito put in his two hypotheticals or asked which of these two situations, something happened and it has continuing risk, or something happened, no risk, but it might happen  -- something like it might happen in the future. This situation presents both, doesn't it?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood the hypothetical then. I do think</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's what I thought he --</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> --I do think the -- the reason it was so devastating to be misled about this occurrence is both, that people were going to be really mad when they find out about it, which is what happened when they did, a nd that it  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It happened and  --</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> --reveals other risks about Facebook's inability to control outside developers' access to third-party -- or to private user data. But the ultimate question here, I think, is simply whether there is a categorical rule that these statements are never or always contain that kind of implication. I think everybody agrees that that's not the case. It's always case -dependent, and it's always fact-specific. And so then I think what's left for the Court in this case is to ask, did the Ninth Circuit held something different?  And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> --are you going to decide the facts of this particular case on whether these particular statements are misleading?  I'm happy to talk about why they're not. We haven't focused on that question because we took the Court to take the case to decide the general legal question.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas?</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> This case, as Mr. Shanmugam indicated, is about falsity. And so  at what point do we analyze that?  The event took place in -- the misuse, in 2015?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> And so -- and the statement was when?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> The statement was in the 2016 annual report.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> So the -- do we just look at that period to determine whether or not the statement is false?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> I --</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Because you made a big  -- you made a big issue of the materiality part, which is -- and the harm, that later on they find out when there's full disclosure that you've got a hundred billion dollar loss, 30 million people's data has been -- have been -- has been d isclosed, et cetera. So at what point do we analyze the falsity?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> I think at the point that they made the statement. And so the  --we acknowledge that if the event had happened so long ago that it was wasn't material, there would be no liability. But, here --</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But we're not talking about materiality at this point, right?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Well, I think it would be false if they were to imply -- there -- there's an interrelationship between these two. Somebody reading a statement that is intended to put you on notice of risks to the business, would make the investment risky, is not going  to read the statement as implying anything about immaterial events, right?  And so, if the event</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> So how do you know in 2016 whether or not it was going to have the downstream -- the later effect of a hundred billion dollars in market cap drop  -- loss?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> So I think two things about that. One is I do think what actually happened is probative at the least of what was foreseeable at the time. And I think Facebook acknowledged in its warning statements that misuse of this kind could seriously damage the business. And it's  only intuitive that it would because user data is the lifeblood of the company, and if somebody gives away your user data that you think is private, people are going to be really angry about that, as they were.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> I understand all of that, but for -- when -- when we're analyzing this for falsity, none of that comes into play.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Only to the extent, I think, that you would not understand a statement to imply the non -occurrence of an immaterial event, right?  And so, once you understand that this is a material event, I agree that how material it is doesn't go to falsity.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> And  --</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> The question is did this happen or not.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Yeah. And, finally, what role does the fact that this is at the motion -to-dismiss stage play in our analysis?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> So the question her e, I think, is not what's the best reading of these particular statements. It is whether we have plausibly alleged that a reasonable jury can conclude that these statements falsely implied  that the omitted event had not occurred. That's the question that  -- Facebook is going to have plenty of opportunity later in the case to argue to -- at summary judgment or to a jury that these statements -- what these -- a reasonable person understood these  statements to make  -- to -- to -- to imply. But, in Omnicare, this Court correctly acknowledged that what statements imply is a question that is principally of fact for the fact finder. And it necessarily makes these kind of cases a little bit messy. It doesn't provide the  -- the clarity that some issuers might like.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Alito? Justice Sotomayor, anything further? Justice Gorsuch, anything?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I just want to clarify, in response to Justice Sotomayor and Justice Alito, exactly what you think that the question is before us. I thought the question was, in a situation where you disclose the risk of an event occurring in the future that could cause harm, is it false not to disclose that the  event -- is that statement false because you don't disclose that that same event had happened in the past even though the harm from that event in the past is over?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> That is the question presented on  --on that question, which has -- which is very different than what we've been talking about all morning. We agree that the answer is no if --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> --you know, it is not misleading to omit the occurrence of an event that is immaterial because it risks no business harm. And in this case, that is not this case.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. I'll read the transcript on that. Okay. And then the second thing, on Justice Thomas's point, I mean, getting past the motion, just to put the real world into this for a second, getting past the motion to dismiss is kind of  --it's the game, right?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> I don't think so. A lot of these cases go to summary judgment, and we've collected a number of cases in which  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, it's a big -- it's a big part of the decision.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> It is. It is big and it is important.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> So it's just -- I'm just stating this. It's not just, oh, it can all be resolved at summary judgment. There's a huge -- there's a huge issue at stake just getting past the motion to dismiss in a lot of these cases. I think everyone --</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> No, I acknowledge that, but I think, at the end of the day, the question here is whether these statements are capable of implying that an event like this hasn't occurred in the past, and if the answer is  they are, then I don't think any amount of policy argument in the world will justify saying that they aren't. And if this Court adopts a categorical rule that's saying statements of this kind are agnostic as a categorical rule about what happened in the past, then I think you are effectively saying that some statements that actually are misleading are not, that they're not actionable. And that, we respectfully suggest, is the office of a safe harbor,  which Congress authorized the SEC, not the courts, to develop.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. Thank you for your answers. Appreciate it.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?  Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Just to quickly clarify your response to Justice Kavanaugh. So it's your view that this past event did present a risk of future business harm?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Is that right?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> That is right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And so that's why you think their question presented doesn't accurately capture what was going on, because they sort of sug gest that it doesn't?</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Right. And the only reason that Facebook has ever given why the misappropriation of 30 million users' private data didn't risk business harm, didn't risk people being really mad when it finally came out, is their claim that the public learned the truth in 2015 and didn't care.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> And  --okay.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Mr. Barber.</text>"
4,2024.23-191 -t01,"<speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Patsy and Felder control this case. In Patsy, this Court held that a failure  to exhaust was not a defense to liability under Section 1983. In this case, however, the Supreme Court of Alabama dismissed Petitioners' claims because Petitioners failed to exhaust, contradicting Patsy's holding. Felder confirms that Patsy applies in state court. This Court reasoned that the dominant characteristic of a civil rights claim is that it's judicially enforceable in the first instance, and that characteristic does not vary depending on whether the suit is filed in federal or state court. The same reasoning applies to this case. Respondent characterizes Alabama's statute as a neutral procedural rule. But there's nothing neutral about it. A claimant  has to seek relief from the Secretary before suing the Secretary. The claimant never  -- the Secretary never has to seek relief from the claimant for anything and never has any reason to exhaust any remedy. Respondent also emphasizes that Alabama's law is jurisdictional. But this Court has held that a state cannot avoid preemption by defining the jurisdiction of state courts to exclude cases in which the defendant asserts an affirmative defense that this Court has held is not available. And that's exactly what happened in this case. Finally and at a minimum, the Alabama statute is preempted as applied to this case in which the Alabama Supreme Court reached the Kafkaesque conclusion that Petitioners could not challenge their inability to exhaust precisely because of their inability to exhaust.

I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Mr. Unikowsky, would you have the same objection if Alabama requ ired these claims to be made in a lower state court?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> No, Your Honor. I think the state is allowed to direct these claims to a  -- to a court as long as there's no exhaustion requirement.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Well, what's the difference?  If it's  -- if -- if -- let's say -- and I'm just speculating -- that it required that it goes to something the equivalent of a  municipal court before it -- before it goes to its trial court, how is that different from going to an agency?  Isn't it a similar exhaustion problem?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> I don't think so. When I think of an exhaustion requirement, I think of a requirement to seek relief from the very person you're planning to sue before suing that person. So that's how Alabama's system works. You have to seek relief from the Secretary. You file a claim with an examiner, who is -- reports to the Secretary. You appeal to an appeals tribunal, which also reports to the Secretary. So you're seeking relief  from the very entity that you're ultimately going to sue. And that's the defect the Court identified in the Felder case. I view that as  different as the state setting up its judicial system to direct courts  -- parties to a third-party neutral.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What if, instead of the requirement you're complaining -- the exhaustion requirement, what if the requirement were simply that parties had to go through a mediation process?  I think several jurisdictions have that. I mean, it may -- it may not last long, but before you can proceed with your suit, you have to sit down, and there's a mediator that sees  --tries to see if you can work it out.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> So I think that sounds a little bit like the rule in Felder. So I  --I probably would say that it's preempted, but I think that would boil down to as to whether it's really an exhaustion requirement. The rule I extract from -- from Patsy is that exhaustion requirements are  -- are preempted. You know, I think there are some borderline cases about whether something really qualifies as an exhaustion requirement. I think that that question is not presented here because it pretty clearly is a requirement of that nature.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, I would have thought that your -- your complaint is focusing on the sort of delay, which is what the exhaustion requirement simply imposes, and if  it's simply you've got -- you've got to try mediation for a while, I don't know why you  would say that's also objectionable.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Well, I think it would depend on exactly what the nuts and bolts of the requirements are. I mean, if you have to present some version of a notice of claim to the state agency and then go through a mediation process, I might say that looks like the notice of claim requirement in Wisconsin. If you can sue right away and then the court just sends the parties off to mediation while the claim is pending, that doesn't sound like an exhaustion requirement at all. It is judicially enforceable in the first instance, and then the court is just applying a p articular procedure to try to encourage a settlement. So I think it would -- it would depend on how the mediation rule worked.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Mr. Unikowsky, when did the state statute of limitations start running, or has it?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> So I think that's an -- an unresolved question whether it would be tolled or not. I think there is some risk that  it wouldn't be tolled, that the state might say that, you know, it expired before you got the  chance to exhaust because that would be the rule in federal court. But I don't think that the  -- the lower courts decided whether there would be tolling during the exhaustion process.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Has it expired for federal purposes?  You know, if your  --if your plaintiffs -- if your plaintiffs -- if your clients were to file in federal court  --</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> No, I don't think --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> -- would they do so?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> We're seeking forward-looking relief, injunctive relief, so we're saying there's a continuing harm. So, no, I think we could still file our -- our lawsuit in federal court.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> And just out of curiosity, why didn't you file a lawsuit in  federal court?  Why did you go to state?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> I think we felt the state court was -- was best positioned to enter an injunction against the -- the state agency. State courts hear the overwhelming majority of  unemployment insurance claims. We just felt the state court would be in the best position to enter and administer an injunction. So that's  why we went to state court.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I'm -- I'm very confused by this system. First of all, I'm not sure what the exhaustion is. Is it just merely of the claim for benefits, or do you also have to  --the way I read the lower court's decision, supreme court decision, which is you have to exhaust your due process claim before the agency as well.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Right. So that  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> They said both things, not just that you have to exhaust trying to get your remedies, but you have to go to the very agency you're accusing of a due process violation to cure it, correct?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Correct. That was the holding as a matter of state law. We argued below that you had to exhaust your claim for  benefits but not the claim that the agency was too slow. But we lost as a matter of state law on that issue.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right. Just so I'm clear in my own mind, I think what Justice Ba rrett was getting at, and I -- and I'm not sure I understand this completely, how this  would work, can you go to state court?  You can't go to federal court to claim a due process violation until you've been denied the process, correct?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So, if you  -- do you really have a workable alternative to go to federal court as opposed to state court?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Well  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You have to file with the state to claim the benefits to start with, correct?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And so you have to be there. So how and when can you go to federal court?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Well, I think --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That  -- that's what I don't understand from the other side, but do you understand it?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> I think you can go to federal court at any time, and your claim might lose on the merits if you haven't tried out the process from the state court, but you can still go. It's just the ground for dismissal wouldn't  be a lack of exhaustion.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It might be a lack of ripeness perhaps, though?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Right. In principle, a federal court could dismiss for lack of ripeness, yes, but it just wouldn't be an exhaustion dismissal.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So what's  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So you're really stuck in a state process with a loop that you can't get out of?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Well, our view is that if we went to federal court in this case, the  -- the federal court would not dismiss for lack of exhaustion under Patsy and would -- it would entertain our due process claims on the merits.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Did you try a futility exception argument?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> I don't -- no, I don't think we  --we made that argument below.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Do you  --do you have any reason to believe that Alabama doesn't recognize a futility exception requirement?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Well, I -- I mean, we argued below that it would be absurd. In our  brief --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> -- we argued it would be absurd to  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> You argued it would be absurd and Catch 22 and --</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text>-- Heller was trotted out. And we -- we hear that from time to time, but that's what a futility exception exists to -- to address. And I'm just curious whether you know whether Alabama law permits a futility argument, and -- and  --and you're saying, as I understand it, that none was attempted here in any event?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> So I don't know the answer to the question. Alabama does say this  is a jurisdictional limitation, which implies to me that there aren't equitable exceptions like futility, but I -- I'm not sure.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> You don't know?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> I don't know.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. And then, if  -- if one were challenging a benefits decision by the federal  --by the federal government, there  -- there's almost assuredly going to be an exhaustion requirement, Social Security disability benefits or whatever, in -- in federal court, and I'm just curious what you might say about the incongruity of refusing to allow a state to have a similar exhaustion requirement that the federal government imposes on Americans.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Well, I don't think it's incongruous at all because I think the practical effect of our rule is that most claims would be dismissed in state court if you're just seeking benefits for  --for lack of merit because you've gotten enough process. In other words, if you -- if you just file a claim in a state agency saying, I want benefits, and then you get a bad decision from the hearing examiner, and then you  just go straight to federal court and say, well, that was a due process violation, I didn't get a good hearing before the examiner, you would lose in federal court. The federal co urt would say there's no due process violation. You have plenty of process in  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> No, I -- I --</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> -- the state court.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- understand that. I think we're speaking past each other. So you -- you're -- you're saying that Alabama can't have an exhaustion requirement, correct?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Only as applied to Section 1983 claims.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Okay. But, if I were to challenge my federal disability benefit claim, identical claim, just against a different government, here, instead of the state, the federal government, you'd almost assuredly have to exhaust your administrative remedies before you could challenge that decision, and I'm  -- I'm just curious how you reconcile that fact with  --with the relief you seek here.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> So I'm actually not sure that's the case if it's the type of claim we're asserting here. Like, suppose you filed a Social Security claim and it was stuck in the  agency for five, 10, 15 years.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> You'd have a futility argument for sure.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Yeah. I think you'd be able to go to federal court.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> That's right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right. But, otherwise, you'd have to exhaust, right?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Right, unless --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And that's what I'm getting at, okay?  So, on the federal system, you have an exhaustion requirement with a futility exception. Assuming Alabama recognizes a futility exception  -- and I'll have that question for counsel, I've done a little research on it, it seems to have one  -- why shouldn't the state be allowed to have the exact  parallel situation that you'd have on the federal system?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> I guess I think that argument  is incompatible with -- with the Felder case. I mean, look at all the reasoning of the Felder case. I think it would rebut that  -- that suggestion. I mean, the Court held that it's  --the state is not permitted to put that type of barrier in front of the vindication of the full right.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> What  --what does Felder -- because that is the linchpin of your argument, is that we've already decided this. So what does  --what kind of state procedural rules or rules does Felder still leave, and how would you define the scope of that?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> So Felder left two categories of rules that the State could apply in its own courts. One are neutral procedural rules. So it gave the example of rules governing substitution of parties and service of process, rules that don't just apply to plaintiffs who sue governmental defendants. And then the second category was certain jurisdictional rules. And Haywood elaborated on this. The Court said that jurisdictional rules that reflect concerns over competence over the subject matter and the power  over the person, that jurisdictional rules are designed to protect. So, you know, examples of such rules would be like in the  --the Herb case, a jurisdictional rule that a territory  -- a city court can only hear cases arising from its territorial limits. The Court upheld such a rule. Or a case saying that the state won't exercise jurisdiction over out -of -state defendants if it's an out-of-state plaintiff. The Court upheld such a rule in the Douglas case from 1929. So those are the types of jurisdictional rules  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Do you  --</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> -- that would --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- do you view Felder as a preemption decision then?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Yes, I view Felder as a preemption decision.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And what -- on what basis was the preemption?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> So the Court talked about purposes and objectives preemption in its opinion. And we actually have no problem with that. We agree with all of its analysis. I actually think there would be a -- there's a straighter path to the result in Felder. I just think there's a  --a direct conflict because, when the Court helds -- holds that an affirmative defense is not available, it just means it's not available, regardless of whether the adjudicator is a federal or sta te judge. So I view sort of direct  --I view Felder as a direct conflict preemption case. The Court did couch it in -- in purposes and objectives language, possibly because, in that case, it actually wasn't clear whether it was an exhaustion requirement at all. Unlike typical exhaustion requirements, you don't have to wait for the agency to rule. And so one of Wisconsin's arguments in that case was this isn't exhaustion like in Patsy. I think that's why the Court walked through all of the -- the reasons that the statute conflicted with, you know, the  purpose of Congress. And then it said, well, actually, we think it is an exhaustion requirement, and then Patsy's reasoning just  -- just follows.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What -- what I guess I'm confused about from your answer to Justice Kavanaugh is how the jurisdictional and neutral requirements relate to the -- the analysis in Felder. I mean, Felder's rule about whether or not it was preempted didn't seem to have anything to do with whether the rule was jurisdictional or neutral. So why do you suggest that that's somehow a way to get out of Felder's analysis about preemption?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Well, I think -- so Felder specifically said the rule in that case wasn't neutral. So the Court has this whole discussion about how, you know, it only applies to  -- to plaintiffs who sue the government. And so that's -- that's not neutral as the  Court --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah, but that's not what  --</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> -- understood the question.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I mean, I'm looking at the analysis in Felder and it -- as you said subsequently, it's a direct preemption case. It says that the notice of claim statute undermines  the uniquely federal remedy that is Section 1983 in several interrelated ways. And then it talks about three ways, one of which is that it conditions the right of recovery that Congress has authorized. The second is that it discriminates against the federal right. And the third is that it  -- it looks like an exhaustion requirement, all right?  But, really, the reason it's preempted is because it undermines the federal right. And it seems to me that Alabama's law is doing all of those three interrelated things. So I don't understand why we care whether or not it's jurisdictional or whether or not it's neutral in  -- in any given sense. It's doing what Felder says you can't do because it undermines the federal right.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> So I agree the Court doesn't have to care about any of that stuff. In fact, there is language in Felder that says that even if a rule is neutral and procedural, it still  --if, you know, it  -- it --it -- if it undermines a federal right, it's still preempted. And we'd be perfectly fine if the Court went in that direction.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well  --</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> I  --I don't think it's neutral and procedural, but -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, do you contest the principle that state courts are generally completely free to define the jurisdiction of their courts?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> No, I don't contest that gener al principle.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> But there are some exceptions, right?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> So why isn't that body of  case law the appropriate body of case law to apply here since the Alabama Supreme Court tells us that this rule is jurisdictional?  We assume -- presumably have to accept that. This is a matter of state court jurisdiction. So why don't we look to the body of case law that explains when this general ru le that the state courts can define the jurisdiction of their own courts gives way?  I know you want to talk about Patsy and Felder, but why is that -- neither of those involves jurisdiction.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> That's right. So this Court has upheld some jurisdictional rules and struck down others, and we're happy to talk about those cases. So, in Howlett and most recently in Haywood, this Court held that jurisdictional rules were preempted, and in both those cases, the  --the rule of decision was that the state courts in general hear 1983 claims and the state courts sometimes hear claims against these particular defendants, and so the state cannot avoid preemption just by defining the jurisdiction of the state courts to exclude cases where this defense is asserted. And, in fact, in the Howlett case, there's actual ly this language that says that Felder would not have come out the other way if Wisconsin had said that state courts lack  jurisdiction over claims in which the notice of claim requirement wasn't satisfied.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, in Haywood, the courts -- the Court concluded that the New York rule evinced hostility toward 1983. Can that be said here, when the Alabama courts will entertain the 1983 claim,  it's just a question of when they will do it?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Well, I think that you would -- I mean, ""hostility"" is too strong a word. But I think the State has a policy disagreement with Congress over the merit of hearing unexhausted claims. Respondent's brief emphasizes that Alabama made the policy judgment that exhaustion is a good idea, it really helps the claimant. And that's the policy judgment that is inconsistent with the policy judgment that Congress made when it enacted Section 1983 without an exhaustion requirement.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> You have a broad argument, Mr. Unikowsky, that if it's an exhaustion requirement, it -- it -- it can't get in the way of a lawsuit. You also have a narrower argument that has to do with this case. But what would be -- if you had to define a narrower class of cases that are preempted so that if we wanted to avoid  the question of whether all preemption -- excuse me, whether all exhaustion requirements were preempted, what would that narrower class of cases look like, and what justifies the parameters?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> So I think the Court could say that it's not going to rule on whether all ex haustion requirements are preempted, but it's going to say that this particular statute is preempted as applied to all 1983 claims. And that holding would avoid looking at the facts of this particular case. And I think the Court could reach that conclusion by comparing the time limits here to the time limits in Felder. So, in Felder, the Court held that the statute undermines Section 1983 because the claimant only had 120 days to bring the suit, and, therefore, the practical effect of the notice of claim statute was to immunize the state against many types of 1983 claims. And so I think, you know, this case, the time limits are actually much shorter. It's  -- it's seven days from receipt or 15 days from mailing of a decision to file an internal appeal to the appeals tribunal. It's also 15 days to go to the board of appeals. One of the  Petitioners in this case alleges that he couldn't appeal because that entire period came  and went when he was in the hospital on  a ventilator because of COVID. So I think that the Court can hold that this particular statute has the same type of adverse effects on claimants as  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Just  -- so it would be a line about the degree of burden that's attached to the 1983 right?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> That  -- that's right. It could  --it could go in that direction because that was part of Felder's reasoning, and so I think the Court can incorporate that.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, it was part o f Felder's reasoning. Felder has this  -- some language that suggests a very broad rule applying to all exhaustion requirements, but then it also goes into the time limits. It has a lot to do with, like, how much burden there is on the 1983 right, and it also discusses the purposes of the statute and whether those purposes suggest a conflict with the policy of 1983. And the relationship between or among all of those things is not particularly clear from the language of the opinion. It sort of suggests that they don't really believe that there's an absolute bar when it comes to exhaustion requirements. Do you agree with that?  Do you have any, you know, views about the relationship among those three aspects of the Court's reasoning?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Yeah, I -- I'm not sure I agree with that because I think the reason there were so many different arguments in Felder was that it wasn't really clear that was an exhaustion requirement in the typical way of you file your claim to the agency, you wait for a couple years, you're trapped in purgatory, and then you leave the agency, right?  Because it was just a notice of claim requirement, you just submit your claim, and if you wait a particular period and they haven't answered, you get to sue. And, in fact, in -- in -- in the part of the opinion talking about exhaustion and -- and  -- and Patsy, the Court says, well, you know, the state says it's de minimis, implying that, you know, maybe some exhaustion  requirements fall under Patsy, but this just isn't one. And the Court says no, no, no, this  really looks like an exhaustion requirement. But, because of that dispute, I think the Court felt the need to go through, you know, all of the other doctrinal machinery. I think this exhaustion requirement is exactly like the ones in Patsy. It's an absolutely classic exhaustion requirement. You go to the agency. You have to wait for it to rule. As this case illustrates, you might have to wait for several years before getting a chance to go to court. And so I think Patsy's reasoning that this is just not an affirmative defense to a Section 1983 claim carries over to this case.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Mr. Unikowsky, how  -- you know, we've said in our own contexts about jurisdiction it's a term of many, many meanings, too many. How are we supposed to -- like, let's say I agree with you that the definition of jurisdiction has to be a federal one. How are we supposed to decide? Because a different test does apply, right, if this is a jurisdictional requirement than if it's just a straight-up, you know, more Felder -like scheme. So what is the test?  How do we decide if a state rule is really jurisdictional or not?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> So the words of this Court's cases, which I'm sure Your Honor knows very well, is that it's really jurisdictional if it reflects concerns over the power over the person or competence over the subject matter that jurisdictional rules are designed to protect. I certainly understand that that formulation will not resolve any or even many cases, but I think that just looking at how the Courts in Howlett and Haywood reached their conclusions  -- so, in both cases, the Court held that, number one, the state courts have general jurisdiction over 1983 claims.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Number two, the state courts in general had authority over these defendants as long as certain other, you know, conditions were satisfied. So, for example, in Haywood, the Court emphasizes that you can get injunctive relief against these defendants. And  so the Court said, well, if there's power over 1983 claims in general, power over these defendants in general, the rule is not a bona fide jurisdictional rule. I think that that's the -- the reasoning in those cases. And, again, carried over to this case, I think you'd have the same reasoning. Alabama courts generally have jurisdiction over Section 1983 claims. There is jurisdiction over this defendant as long as the claim is exhausted. There's claim  -- jurisdiction over unexhausted claims when there is no exhaustion requirement in the particular scheme. All that's happening here is that the state is cutting out from jurisdiction claims in which the -- the -- the defendant has this particular affirmative defense, even though this Court has held that that's not a defense under Section 1983. And so I don't think the Court really has  to elaborate the exact lines here. Its -- the lines are a little bit blurry, but I think that, you know, as applied to these particular  facts, you can just --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> It's like a claims processing rule --</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Right. Exactly.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> -- rather than a jurisdictional rule?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Exactly. So, I mean, you know, I think there's going to be a lot of borderline cases, but I don't think this is -- this is one.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> I  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> And let me just ask you one question about how this scheme works because I agree it's very odd. Is there some mechanism when you're before this intermediate tribunal where you actually fill out a piece of paper and say, I'm asserting a due process claim in addition to my claim for benefits?  How would one even exhaust the due process portion of this?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> So I've been wondering that too. I mean, maybe you can just go back right now to the appeals tribunal and, like,  file, like, a 28(j) letter saying, hey, enough time has passed; you know, there's a due process violation. I don't  -- I don't know if there's any procedural mechanism to do that that I'm aware of, but that does seem to be what the state court is requiring here.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> I came into this case thinking that perhaps there wasn't a great deal at stake since a plaintiff like your plaintiffs could always file in federal court and avoid the exhaustion requirement by doing that. But what you just said in response to Justice Barrett makes me think that this could be much more important because, if we are going to read into the general rule that state courts can define their jurisdiction, what we have done in determining whether federal statutes are jurisdictional, which is pretty much to say, boy, it's really hard for us to conclude that anything is jurisdictional, then you are really asking for a significant weakening of this general rule which has been a  -- a --a landmark rule for hundreds of years.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> So I'm not sure the Court should engage in the sort of statutory interpretation of state statutes that it would engage in for federal statutes. That's not the  rule we're asking for, all right?  We're not quarreling with the state court that, as a matter of state law, this is a jurisdictional statute.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. Fine. All right.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Okay?  What we're just saying is that not all jurisdictional rules are created alike for purposes of federal law, and that distinction might sort of match the jurisdictional versus claim processing type of distinction that this Court has articulated --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> -- in federal cases.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And are you saying that, assuming this is a state jurisdictional rule, it cannot or can be preempted?  What is -- I thought this case was about preemption, not about the characterization of the state law. So, if we agree and assume that  the state law is jurisdictional, what implication for whether or not it can be preempted by federal law?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> In this case, I think there's no implications. It's preempted regardless of whether it's jurisdictional.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Why?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Because this Court has held as far back as, like, the Mondou case in 1912 that a state court cannot decline jurisdiction over a federal claim because of a disagreement with  --with the federal policy allowing the claim to proceed. And I think that's what's happening in this case. Alabama has the view that exhaustion is a good idea, and it has imposed that by statute. But Congress has decided that that's not the case, that you should be able to bring 1983 claims without having to exhaust. And so the rule  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And so it's a Supremacy Clause issue in terms of whether or not that has to be the outcome?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Yeah. I think the rule of decision applied by the state court in this case is inconsistent with the rule of decision that Section 1983 requires the state court to adopt. So I think there's just direct preemption in that way. We're not disagreeing with the purpose and objectives analysis in Felder. We agree with that too. But I think there's an even more  straightforward way to get to the same outcome.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Put aside Felder. What is the problem with just going to federal court?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Well, we could have gone to federal court, but there's a lot of cases from this Court. I won't mention Felder, but there's a lot of other cases --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, what is the real-world problem with just going to federal court?  Or maybe there aren't any and you're just saying precedent says we can go to state court. But do you have any real-world problems with just going to federal court?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Yeah, I think there's a lot of reasons that you would want to go to state court. So, first of all, the Pennhurst  doctrine sometimes prohibits plaintiffs from bringing state law claims in federal court. Federal courts also often talk -- have  abstention doctrines that prohibit bringing the claim in federal court. There's a  -- there's a brief from two religious freedom organizations  that talks about the abstention doctrines in some detail. Also, there's practical concerns. Like, in some cases, lawyers would just be more familiar with the local state court. The vast majority of unemployment insurance litigation in Alabama happens in state court. And  so, if a lawyer may be more familiar with that tribunal, they may spend their entire career practicing in state court, and if they have a civil rights claim from a claimant, then it makes sense for them to go to state court.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And you mentioned this earlier, but a procedural due process claim usually requires that you go through the state processes first. Maybe that's how this case got on the -- on the wrong track. Do you agree with that?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> In general, yes. I think that if you went to federal court and asserted your due process claim without  exhausting, you'd usually lose, except in an unusual case like this, where you're actually challenging the inability to exhaust.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. I want to make sure I have your complete answer to the line of questioning I  -- I understood Justice Kagan to be pursuing, I mean  --and I think why you called this Kafkaesque, which is because you're being told you have to go to the state  -- your -- your claim is the state doesn't handle these things in a timely fashion, they lose the papers, you can't answer the phone, so why send them back? If you have to go back there, that's -- your whole point is you  -- you --you can't go back there because they do such a  --that's what you're challenging. And I just want to make sure whether  --if you had the most efficient state procedure imaginable, you know, they answer the phone on the first ring and they quickly give -- you a decision, would your argument be the same, that it doesn't matter?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> It would be the same. We would definitely lose in that scenario, but it would be the same argument, that you wouldn't have to exhaust. So, if such a claim was filed</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> You would -- I'm just  --you would lose?  In other words --</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> On the merits. On the merits, we would lose.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> You would not -- then the ruling would be you do not  -- you -- you do -- you do have to go to the state before pursuing your 1983 action?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> We don't think that  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> I mean the state agency.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> So we don't think there should ever be an exhaustion requirement. If you filed a suit in federal court and said, you know, even though they answered on the first ring, they should have been even faster, there wouldn't be an exhaustion problem. The federal court would just say there's no due process violation. It's a great state agency. It's very effective. And we just want the state court to apply the same rule of decision, right?  You don't have to exhaust, but your claim loses because you're getting plenty of process and  there's no problem with the process.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. Well, then what was Kafkaesque about the process?  I  understood you to say that that was the problem, that it was  -- it imposed a burden on your -- the exercise of your  --your federal right.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> What was Kafkaesque is the ruling that we couldn't challenge our inability to exhaust precisely because we haven't exhausted. That was the problem. Like, our  -- the problem was we can't exhaust effectively, and the state court held that because you didn't exhaust  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, but what if you can --</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> -- you can't challenge that.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> -- what if you can exhaust effectively?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Well, then you wouldn't have a -- a claim. I mean, I  -- the problem is, as applied to this fact pattern, I think it doesn't make sense to apply an exhaustion requirement, and that's why we think that, as applied, effectively, what the statute is doing is  granting the state immunity in the state courts from this.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. My last question:  You say ""as applied to this fact pattern.""</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> So tell me what the particulars of this fact pattern are that may not be the case in other situations.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> The particulars of this fact pattern is when the Petitioners are challenging their failure to exhaust and they're told that they can't challenge their failure to exhaust until they have, in fact, exhausted. The problem with that is that as a practical matter, you're immunizing the state in the state court from the 1983 claim because you can't exhaust. So you're incapable of challenging your inability to exhaust because the state is saying you have to exhaust until you can bring the challenge. So there's no way to challenge in state court at all, and so it's a de facto immunity akin to the immunities that were in the Haywood and  -- and the Howlett case. So that's our  --our narrowest argument on this.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Could you have sought mandamus in state court to get a ruling in these cases?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> An administrative ruling in these cases?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> So there's a dictum that is cited by Respondent from a 1997 intermediate appellate court case that says that, in principle, mandamus could be available if an agency intentionally sits on a claim and drags its feet, but no mandamus claim was asserted there. I  -- I think mandamus wouldn't be very effective in this case for a few reasons. So, first of all, of course, you have to show a clear and indisputable right to the  writ, which is a higher standard than in an ordinary civil case. Also, you wouldn't  --the only thing the state court could do is tell the state agency to rule. It couldn't enter the other  remedi es that -- that we're seeking in this case. Mandamus is also a discretionary remedy, and so I just don't think it's an effective substitute for the 1983 claims we're asserting today.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> What if a state has a  -- a regime under which the -- the -- the person seeking the benefits first has to file the claim and then there  --there's a -- there are two levels of  -- of appellate review, administrative review, and after -- I assume that you would admit that if the case were filed in federal court, the -- the person would have to seek the benefits in the first instance, right?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Yes. They wouldn't have to  -- it wouldn't be an exhaustion problem under Patsy.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> No. Okay.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> They'd have to seek the benefits because there's no violation if you haven't tried the benefits.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. And then the  -- then the -- the person says, oh, this process is too long, I -- I want a quick decision, they denied my claim. Then what?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> It's a violation of my due process rights because this is more elaborate than it needs to be.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> So, if your claim was denied --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> -- you can go to federal court and you can file your claim and you can say there was a due process violation, and the court would adjudicate that. If you jumped the gun and didn't wait for all the process to wrap up, then probably the federal court would say that there's no due process problem. The state's given you plenty of process. And we'd want the state court to reach the same ruling. And if that's not the case, if you were collaterally attacking the state court administrative process and you finished it and there was still a due process violation, then maybe you'd win in federal court. And if you'd win in federal court, you should win in state court too. We're just asking to align the  rules.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counsel, I  -- you say this is not a neutral rule because, in every other case where there's a due process violation of an agent  -- of an agency's process in some way, people can go directly to state court, correct?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> That  -- that's one reason it's not neutral. Another reason is Felder's reason, which is that it only applies to plaintiffs who sue the government.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Plaintiffs who sue the government but for this particular type of benefit?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So it is sui generis to just one class of plaintiffs on one potential constitutional violation?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> That's right.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Or take  --</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> It does apply to -- I  -- it does apply to state law claims. I acknowledge that. But it's not neutral in the sense that it doesn't apply in private tort litigation. It doesn't apply to other lawsuits against the government.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I guess I'm having trouble with the jurisdictional argument that my colleagues are concerned about. This is not jurisdictional in the sense of we're telling state courts that they can't hear a claim, correct?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> That  -- I agree with that, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right. We're not saying this is a federal claim, so it has to go to federal court. We're saying, no, you state courts have the power to hear constitutional -- 1983 constitutional claims. That your legislature permits you to do. So it's not as if they're  -- filed a neutral rule that says you can't hear 1983 claims, correct?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Mm-hmm. I agree, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And so all we're saying is you, state courts, should decide in the first instance whether there is a due process violation, correct?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> That's correct. We're not saying in this Court that we necessarily deserve to win. We just want a chance to be heard.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan?</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> In the colloquy that you had with the Chief Justice, you started with the broad form of your argument and ended up with a narrower form, a much narrower form. In the delta between the two, it seems to me you're going to lose on the merits anyway. In other words, if somebody goes in and says, I got $100, I really deserve $200, they didn't listen to a certain category of evidence, that's a due process violation. You know, you've not made the argument, they're just  going to throw you out, whether it's -- you call it on the merits or for  -- for -- because your claim isn't ripe. So why should we go to the broad form of the argument when nobody's going to win in that category of cases anyhow?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> I  --I guess I just think that's the cleanest reading of Felder. I mean, Felder has lots of different rationales, and I think all those rationales apply to exhaustion requirements in general. Or, even more narrowly, all those rationales apply to this statute whenever it's applied. So the Court could go narrow. I just  --I just don't see a way of distinguishing Felder from any other case in which the exhaustion requirement is invoked. But, you know, if the Court rules in our favor narrowly, obviously, that's  --that's fine from our perspective.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Gorsuch?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> This new narrow theory, what  --what exactly does it encompass? What class of cases?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> So the narrowest argument that I've articulated is, when there's a  de facto immunity from the application of the rule, then there's a preemption problem.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> When it's impossible to exhaust?  Is that  --is that another way of saying it?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Well, when the very thing you're challenging is your failure to exhaust, then the state can't say you  -- you failed to exhaust because, once  you've exhausted, then your  --then your claim goes away because you -- you've exhausted and it becomes moot at that point. So, essentially, you're immunizing the state from these claims that there's a due process violation in connection with the exhaustion procedure.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I'm not sure I've got it, bu t let me try. That it's impossible to bring your claim?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> I think, applying this rule, it's impossible to challenge the  exhaustion requirement in a state court, yes.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. And what if it's not impossible here because of mandamus, because you might have a futility argument?  We just don't know. Then what?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> So I don't think Respondent has argued in favor of futility arguments.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Well, I think all of this is kind of new, to be honest with you, this  --this narrow theory. I  -- I read your brief as pressing the broad theory, but here we are. Let -- let's say we just don't know whether it is truly impossible here. What do we do then?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Well, I -- even if it's not truly --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Putting aside your broad theory.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> No, I understand, Your Honor. Even if it's not truly impossible, I still think that at least it  -- it -- it puts a condition, a significant condition in front of the vindication of the claim that's no less significant than the condition in -- in the Felder case.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> What if they're the same sorts of conditions that exist in the federal administrative realm?  When we're  dealing with a federal benefit and an agency doesn't rule, I'd make a futility argument and I'd maybe mandamus the agency.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> I guess I think nine -- Section 1983 is a special statute. This Court held --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> -- in Patsy that there's no exhaustion requirement. There's immediate access to a judicial forum. So I just think that's different from the mine-run case in which you're challenging a decision from the Social Security agency.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?  Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> I just want to clarify your answer to Justice Gorsuch. He asked you to stick to the narrow theory, but to answer, you reverted to the broad one, that Patsy just precludes exhaustion requirements generally. If we do not agree with your reading of Patsy, can you articulate  --try one more time to articulate that narrow theory that doesn't rely on Patsy?</text><speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text> Sure. I would say that there is a significant barrier to the vindication of a claim challenging the inability to exhaust a remedy when the court holds that you have to exhaust a remedy in order to bring that claim. I mean, what we're trying to do is get the state agency to give us hearings and give us adequate notice. And what the state court said is that because you didn't exhaust those remedies precisely because we didn't get the hearing and the notice, you can't bring your claim. So, even if Justice Gorsuch is correct that there's some theoretical way with mandamus, which we don't think this is an adequate substitute, to bring the claim, I mean, there's still a very significant barrier which is  --to the bringing of the claim. So, you know, that  does place the type of barrier that I think would conflict with Congress's objectives when it enacted Section 1983.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?  Thank you, counsel. Mr. LaCour.</text>","<speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  This Court finds historic state powers to be preempted only when the text of federal law makes that result clear. Nothing in 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 makes clear that it was meant to preempt neutral jurisdictional rules like the one at issue here. Petitioners' reliance on Patsy ignores the key difference between exhaustion rules created by Congress and exhaustion doctrines crafted by courts. The former may preempt, but the latter do not. They are judge-made timing rules, like ripeness and abstention, that do not add elements to a federal right but merely determine when a federal court is going to hear it. This Court's ripeness and abstention holdings do not apply to state courts. Nor does  its determination that federal courts generally should not send 1983 plaintiffs to the states. Precedent confirms that 1983 does not contain a categorical no -exhaustion element. In Johnson v. Fankell, the Court did not require immediate appellate review of a 1983 defense. In Ohio Civil Rights Commission v. Dayton Christian Schools from 1986, this Court applied Younger abstention to force a 1983 plaintiff back into state agency proceedings. These decisions show that deferring consideration of a federal right does not necessarily alter or defeat it. Thus, while some notice of claims rules, like the one in Felder, are preempted as obstacles to adjudication and liability, agency review is typically a means of adjudication and does not inherently conflict with 1983's remedial purpose. But, even if immediate judicial consideration were an unwritten element of 1983,  neutral jurisdictional rules like Alabama's are still a valid excuse for declining jurisdiction. Reading 1983 to preempt such laws would raise serious constitutional questions that are best avoided. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>Edmund G.

But, even if immediate judicial consideration were an unwritten element of 1983,  neutral jurisdictional rules like Alabama's are still a valid excuse for declining jurisdiction. Reading 1983 to preempt such laws would raise serious constitutional questions that are best avoided. I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Well, Mr. Unikowsky's argument as I understand it is that the exhaustion rules in Alabama makes it impossible for  -- for him to pursue the due process cl aims that he has under 1983. So would you respond to that?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Yes, Your Honor. Two points. One, as Justice Gorsuch was alluding to, that is a new argument that was not presented to the Alabama Supreme Court. It was not passed upon by the Alabama Supreme Court. It's not in the cert petition, and it's not properly before this Court. Their only argument is that even the most perfect agency adjudication, if it has an exhaustion rule, is preempted. And we think that, as Justice Kagan was alluding to with Felder, that that rule has already been rejected by this Court. But looking at this as-applied challenge to Alabama's law, we don't think that it is the case that it functions as an immunity. Mandamus is still available. There is still the potential for a futility argument, one that was not raised below. And so it's simply not the case that it is impossible to get an adjudication here.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I'm not sure how it is possible given that, as I read the court's decision below, you have to bring the due process argument to the agency, and I don't see any procedure to do that within the agency.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, Your Honor --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> There's nothing that  --there's no mandamus within the agency. I don't know how the mandamus court would have jurisdiction because it requires exhaustion. So you're in a loop that I'm not sure how this claimant gets out of.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Your Honor, I don't think mandamus would require exhaustion. The point of mandamus would be to break the sort of logjam that Plaintiffs are complaining about here, but they didn't take advantage of mandamus.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well, Alabama -- Alabama ruled very broadly. It didn't say that  Mr. Williams, for example, who had a final judgment that he was attacking, had a claim that could be heard in court. And you seem to  concede in your briefs that he did. He got his claim thrown out because he didn't file a notice of claim. Then he brought a due process argument saying that the notice he received was inadequate or the time limits were not proper under due process. And the Alabama court dismissed his action as unexhausted. That sounds to me as if the due process claim has to be exhausted w ithin the agency.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, Your Honor, if -- if he had exhausted it and it was final, he had the ability to file a direct appeal to the circuit court.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> He did.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> No, Your Honor  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And the court -- he did. The court did what it did. And, all of a sudden, he goes up to the Alabama Supreme Court and it dismisses it as unexhausted.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Your Honor, I think it's important to remember how this was actually litigated before the state courts. Their  primary argument, if you go back to their briefs before the state courts, was that this exhaustion requirement didn't apply to sort of procedural challenges whatsoever. There was no  1983 claim --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well, please just tell  me what form -- where is it in this process that tells litigants, if we're not acting, you can go to the appeals council and file something and get them to order the agency to do something, and then, if the agency doesn't do it, maybe you've exhausted and you have a futility argument to go seek mandamus or to go do something in state court. This is a Kafkaesque type of process that's going on here.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Your Honor, I don't think so. Alabama case law makes clear that mandamus is available and that you may be able to raise futility arguments.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It's discretionary mandamus, isn't it?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Correct, but we -- we presume that state courts --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And I don't know how  --</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> -- are going to follow the federal Constitution.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- I actually don't know how mandamus operates with respect to the exhaustion requirement.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, and that just points out the waiver problems that I was addressing earlier. None of this was briefed up below. None of this was argued in the blue brief either. And so what we are dealing with here is this categorical rule. And we don't think that even Patsy supports this categorical rule.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, General, on -- on that question, you started the day but with the  --the text of federal law does not preempt, you know, and that's a fair argument and a good argument. It's just the argument that was in the dissent in Felder. Justice O'Connor made exactly those same points, but it was a dissent in Felder. And in the majority in Felder, it made clear that the exhaustion  requirement by Wisconsin's law was problematic. It said it ""doesn't involve lengthy or expensive administrative proceedings, but it forces injured persons to seek satisfaction from those alleged to have caused the injury in the first place. Such a dispute resolution system may  have much to commend it, but that is a judgment the current Congress must make.""  In other words, the language in Felder does seem -- contra Justice O'Connor's dissent, the language in the majority in Felder does seems to suggest that exhaustion requirements generally -- and we can talk about how to define those -- but generally are preempted even though there's no text.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, a few things on that point, Your Honor. First is Felder did not just say Patsy ruled and then, in a two-page opinion, end the case. There was a detailed, nearly 15-page preemption analysis there. And the Court made clear there were really two key problems with the Wisconsin law. One was that, in purpose and effect, it minimized liability. And so there's your clear conflict. You have a federal law  designed to impose liability and a state law designed to minimize it. I think that is t he through line from Felder to Howlett to Haywood, is those are immunity laws. And, second, the Court said that the law in Wisconsin frequently and predictably defeated the 1983 claim. Now ""defeat"" means that you're going to exercise jurisdiction over it and then dismiss it with prejudice because it is an affirmative defense that the defendants were handed by Wisconsin, and that did result in dismissals with prejudice. Jurisdiction -- like the law at issue in Alabama, jurisdiction's not an affirmative defense. You would never say that an amount in controversy requirement is an affirmative defense. And it doesn't defeat the right. It simply says we're not going to consider it. And so there's no way for Alabama to alter the 1983 right by merely --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But that's not all that Felder  --</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> -- declining jurisdiction over it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Counsel, that  --I apprec iate that summary of what Felder said, but in the section on page 141 where it talks about what it means to undermine for preemption purposes, it, first of all, has three things, not just two, and the three things aren't just  minimizing liability and defeating the 1983 claim. It says it conditions the right of recovery that Congress has authorized  and does so for a reason manifestly inconsistent with the purposes of the federal statute. So that's one thing. And I appreciate that it coloned to minimize government liability --</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- but the point is that it's inconsistent with the purposes of the federal statute. Second, the notice provision discriminates against the federal right, and it talks about the differences in the time limits in a way that discriminates. And then, finally, it operates in part as an exhaustion requirement. Now I appreciate that your counsel on the other side is just homing in on the  exhaustion requirement, but Felder seems to take it even beyond that. So can you explain why  Alabama's law is not doing the three things tha t mattered in Felder to the preemption analysis?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Yes. So agency adjudication is not a means of minimizing liability. It is a means of adjudicating whether or not claimants are entitled to money. I think that's far different from the notice of claims requirement in Felder, which had no benefit whatsoever to plaintiffs. Unlike here, the exhaustion requirement in Alabama law can be beneficial to plaintiffs because it keeps their well-heeled employers or the Secretary from taking them to court immediately  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right. But can you talk about the purposes of the federal statute, right?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Yes. And  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Because I understood preemption to be about inconsistency  --</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- with the reasons or the goals the federal statute was there. So isn't a requirement like Alabama's, which prohibits the ability to bring a due process claim under these circumstances,  inconsistent with Section 1983, which is supposed to be giving people the ability to make these kinds of claims?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Your Honor, we're not prohibiting anyone from bringing them. You get to raise those very claims in front of the agency first. And I think that's a key difference between the Wisconsin law --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But not if the agency won't process your papers.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, and -- and, Your Honor, that's why we have mandamus. That's why the futility arguments are -- are present as well. And then, second, there's  --there's a key difference between going to an agency for an adjudication and just being forced to go park your claim for 120 days with the police officers who purportedly beat you up, the law at issue in Felder. Again, that in no way can benefit plaintiffs. But the exhaustion requirement can benefit plaintiffs. And also, my -- my friend is -- is incorrect. The exhaustion requirement does  apply to the Secretary as it applies to claimants as well.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So your argument at bottom is that this is consistent with Congress's objectives in 1983?  Because I understood that to be the sort of umbrella consideration with respect to preemption, which is what I thought we were talking about here.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Yes. I  --I don't see any conflict with the way Alabama has structured judicial administration and with the purposes of 1983, which are to impose liability. This is not a liability -minimizing scheme. It was not designed to do that. It was invented in 1935 to make unemployment benefits available to people. No one would think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Has anybody ever recovered in 1983 making these kinds of claims in Alabama state court that you're aware of?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Your Honor, I  -- I'm not aware. I have not  -- not seen one cited by my friends and have not found one myself. But I don't think anyone would say that the Social Security Administration is set  up as an obstacle to people who are trying to get disability benefits. It is the avenue for getting that. And it's the same thing for Department of Labor.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So can I ask about the dimensions of your argument in two different ways?  I'll give you just a couple hypotheticals. So one is suppose we take this out of the employment context. We're not talking about a benefit of any kind. There's a person who has, like, a quintessential 1983 claim, which is the improper use of police force, and Alabama sets up a scheme where you have to go to the police department first and you have to go through these three levels of review before you can bring that to court. Is that perfectly okay?  Does  -- or does that change matters?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> I think, Your Honor, if we're talking about case by case, then I think  it's time to affirm the Alabama Supreme Court's decision because it was just this categorical argument. But, second, to get to your question, you need to look to see does this look like a rule of judicial administration or not. It may be looking a lot more like Felder and thus might be more suspect, but --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I  --I don't understand. What makes it more suspect?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, it  --it might be what are  --like, who is it that's doing the adjudication?  What are the sort of requirements that bind them?</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Yeah, I mean, it's sort of set up the same way, but there, it's a police board. You know, police officers are on these boards, and they make you go through three -- three different stages, and we make you do all that for police boards of different levels before you can take the claim to court.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Your Honor, again, if it's particularly stringent, you might run into some problems like in the Brown case from 1949. If it looks like it's designed to minimize liability, you might run into some Felder problems.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, if, if, if. Let's just say it's the same kind of thing, but it's in the police context.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Your Honor --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> It's the same time limits. It's the same everything. There's no piece of paper that says we're doing this to prevent good claims. You know, it's  -- but -- but it's in a -- it's in a different context, a non-benefits context, a quintessential 1983 context.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> The Court has said in Howlett and Haywood that neutral rules of judicial administration are a valid excuse for refusing to entertain a federal claim. So, if that is a valid and -- and jurisdictional rule that's been set up, then I think that would be okay.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, why wouldn't  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> -- that look an awful lot like Haywood itself, a -- a rule that evinces hostility to the 1983 claim?  Because  there's no tradition of requiring this sort of thing when a plaintiff wants to sue -- wants to bring a classic Fourth Amendment 1983 claim.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, I think that history could factor in. But, at the same time,  in Haywood, there was no way to get into state court whatsoever. I took it in Justice Kagan's hypothetical that you -- you would get to court eventually to raise your claim. And so -- and this Court has said  -- I think this Court's rulings show that merely deferring consideration of a claim is very different than defeating it. So look at Johnson v. Fankell, where you had a 1983 defense of qualified immunity that was denied at summary judgment stage  in the Idaho trial court, and they wanted to take that up immediately to the Idaho Supreme Court and were not able to do so. 1983 did not give them some right of interlocutory appeal. And I think that's essentially what Petitioners are asking for here, is a right of interlocutory appeal.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, I -- I don't want to derail -- Justice Kagan, I think, had a number of hypotheticals, but  --so I -- I don't want to interrupt that. But then, eventually, I  do want to ask you about Mr. Unikowsky's narrow argument. Did you want to --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> It -- it doesn't matter which way we do it.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. I'm not sure I can capture exactly what his narrow argument is. But suppose the narrow argument is that there's no exhaustion requirement in a 1983 case in state court, where it is, as a practical matter, impossible or extraordinarily onerous to get a decision. How would the state be hurt by that? What would be wrong with that?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> I think there might still be some  -- some sovereignty interest if you're going to be reading the statute to require state courts to exercise jurisdiction that the state has never given them jurisdiction to exercise. And that's why the Court has been careful in -- even in Haywood to say that these neutral and  -- and truly jurisdictional rules are a valid excuse for declining jurisdiction. That's the nature of an y jurisdictional rule. That's going to keep some  cases out of court, so that can't be the test.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> But it  --it -- couldn't it be, though, that in some of those cases at least, where it's truly impossible and  it really is a Catch 22, that that is evincing hostility to the plaintiffs' claims and a Felder argument might be made there?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Absolutely. Or even a Haywood argument.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Or even a Haywood argument. I mean, you -- we just don't know whether that's the case here.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah. All right.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> How about if -- you know, in Felder, there is a lot of talk about the time limits. Here, the time limits are even more stringent than they were in Felder. Suppose we make them even more stringent still, and let's add another bunch of things. Let's say that instead of three levels of review, there are five levels of review. Let's say between each level you have to proceed  within five days, and then you have to bring your court claim at the very end within five days. Let's say we have empirical evidence that suggests that because the state administrative process is very slow, it takes an average of 10 years to actually get to court. At that point, can we say that this is so  -- so onerous a process that it has to be in conflict with 1983?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Your Honor, that sounds like it  -- it could fall under Haywood and -- and potentially be in conflict with 1983 under a Haywood theory. Even if it is a truly jurisdictional rule, that starts to look like an evasion rather than something that's really about the competence over the subject matter. But, here, this truly is about competence over the subject matter. You have an expert agency -- like, since these claims existed for the first time in 1935, they've always been adjudicated in the first instance by these hearing officers. They have expertise when it comes to hearing these types of claims because they hear thousands or hundreds of thousands a year. They're applying the statutes  and regs again and again. It's the exact sort of situation that this Court confronted in Elgin v. Department of Treasury, a Thunder Basin case about the Merit Systems Protection Board, where the Court recognized that the MSPB has certain expertise because they hear these personnel claims again --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> You're making a  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> But the expert -- oh. The expertise is in adjudicating the entitle  -- entitlement to unemployment, not the due process claim, right?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> But, Your Honor, a similar argument was made in Elgin that the MSPB doesn't typically hear constitutional claims. And what the Court recognized was well, no, they are going to hear some similar types of claims that are going to come up again and again in this context. For example, it's not fair because I didn't get my notice on time; therefore, excuse my lack of  -- of --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> But  --</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> --of filing the appeal. And then that can be considered by the board of appeals, the appeals tribunal, or -- or the circuit court eventually.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So tell me -- and this is just the clarifying question I was trying to ask Mr. Unikowsky  -- how does one assert these due process claims, say, before the intermediate tribunal?  Is there a mechanism for doing that?  It just seems like everything that was a description in the briefs was  talking about how to pursue getting your unemployment benefit. How does one go about making this due process argument before the agency?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Your Honor, my understanding is it's a fairly informal process. I  -- I think it would be as simple as arguing that this is not fair because the notice was ineffective, for example. But, again, ultimately, that issue was not thoroughly briefed because that wasn't the argument they were pressing before the state supreme court.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> You're making your position seem benign, but we have amicus briefs  from a wide variety of groups, from ACLU and Public Citizen to religious liberty groups, to the Chamber of Commerce, all of which say that your rule will really hinder federal civil rights claims from getting into state court. The religious liberty plaintiffs say that your position would ""grind religious litigants into submission before they are able  to have their claims heard in court.""  We see the same thing from the ACLU's brief. You want to respond to that?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Yeah. No, I think this Court's precedents in cases like Felder and Haywood help to guard against that. Plus, if the  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> They  -- don't they guard against it by saying that exhaustion is not a requirem ent before you bring a 1983 suit in state court?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> No, I -- Felder, again, did not deal with an agency adjudication. It dealt with a law that said park your claim here for four months and then  --and if you don't do that, you have an affirmative defense you're going to be facing and you're going to lose, which I think is -- is far different than --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Yeah, but every  -- just to pause there, your answer suggests  that I'm misreading Felder. Every state supreme court that has considered the issue, I think,  before the Alabama Supreme Court has read it just the way I just said.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Your Honor, I think -- I think South Dakota was on our side, and then, in some of those cases, you're dealing with  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> The vast majority of state supreme courts.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> We're definitely on the short side of the split, but we don't spend --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And the short side of the split is because those state supreme courts, almost uniformly, have read Felder to mean you can't have exhaustion requirements -- a very simple rule, you can't have exhaustion requirements for 1983 in federal or state court. And you have a good argument to the contrary. The problem is it's in the O'Connor dissent, not in the majority in Felder.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> No, Your Honor, I  -- I -- again, I think you have to read those statements from Felder in their context, and, of course, opinions are not statutes, but, if they were, I'd invoke the presumption against superfluity. There -- there's a lot more in Felder to suggest  that what was really the problem was that it was trying to minimize liability. And there, the  conflict couldn't be clearer with 1983. But I -- I cannot find in the text or in Patsy this categorical no-exhaustion rule, and I don't see how you square that with cases like Ohio Civil Rights Commission, which I -- I mentioned in my opening, and  I apologize it's not in the briefs, but it's a 1986 decision where this Court applied Younger abstention to a 1983 claim to force that claimant back into a state agency proceeding. Dayton Christian Schools had fired a teacher on religious grounds, sort of a precursor to Hosanna -Tabor. The teacher went to the Civil Rights Commission and said this was based on sex. And the Commission opened an investigation. That 1983 plaintiff went to federal court and said we have a free exercise right to be free from these state proceedings altogether. And in an opinion by then Justice Rehnquist, the Court said no, take it up in the state agency, which again shows that deferring consideration does not defeat. And it also suggests that my friend's  position would lead to very strange outcomes where a federal court in Ohio did not have to hear that particular 1983 claim, but a state court would have to. That just simply doesn't add up. And I think that gets to the point --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> You have just one more. You  -- you've invoked federalism and respect for states, but I think the practical effect of your rule, if we were to adopt it, would be everyone or most people would go more quickly to federal court and haul the state before federal court. I'm just  --the irony of that, can you comment on that?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> I don't think so, Your Honor. I don't think there's an incentive for states to structure their courts in a way that's necessarily going to send everything to federal court. If they do, then so be it. But, at the same time, that might be an incentive for  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, these kinds of claims, if you had problems, you know, a free exercise problem, a religion problem, or a procedural due process problem with the unemployment scheme in Alabama, you're just going to go to federal court, right?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Right, and as Mr. Unikowsky acknowledged, you'll lose on the merits. So I don't think that's going to be a serious problem here for Alabama.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's the point of suppressing the federal right in state court, isn't it?  If you make the hoops so difficult to go through, then they have no remedy. Here, Mr. Williams was thrown out of -- out of the state process because he didn't receive notice because he was unconscious because of COVID, and he's had no remedy in their state court. So, basically, what you're really saying is no, we're not hostile to a federal right because we know we're going to win no matter what we do.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Your Honor, I think --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And -- and one last question. Tell me where in your regulations there is a process set out that -- that claimants can go through to speed up the process.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, Your Honor --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All of them have told me that they've appealed on time, they've called a  --not all of them, but we have 21 plaintiffs here. Many of them filed their appeal notices, letter after letter, phone call  after phone call, years and years that passed before they received anything or, when they received something, with no explanation. So tell me where in your regulations you tell claimants what they can do before the agency if there's a due process violation.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Your Honor, I don't have chapter and verse for you because, again, this was not raised --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You can provide a letter. I don't want to hear about mandamus or  -- I want to hear where in the regulations these people didn't do what the regulations said they could have done.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Your Honor, mandamus is not something they're required to do, but it is something that is available  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And it's --</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> --to them.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- discretionary, correct?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Counsel, can  --</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Yes, Your Honor, but it is one way to avoid due process problems.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> In the --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Counsel, can I just -- oh, go ahead.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> No, go ahead.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just get you to focus in quickly on Felder, and you -- you've said many times that you see that case as the problem being about minimizing liability. But I'm quoting from the case when it says that this is ""essentially""  --""the question is essentially one of preemption. Is the application of the state's law to Section 1983 actions brought in state courts consistent with the goals of the federal civil rights laws, or does the enforcement of such a requirement instead stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes of the objectives of Congress?""  I thought we were thinking about is  it an obstacle, is it consistent?  And what I'm  worried about is that if we start moving away from that conception of what it means to be preempted, that same kind of thought process and  doctrine is used in other laws, not just 1983. For example, we have the Federal Arbitration Act, which has a preemption standard that is almost identical to what Felder just said about whether or not it's consistent. And we've repeatedly said that state laws that do things like  -- you know, related to contracts, et cetera, et cetera, are preempted by the FAA for the very same reasons. So can you help us not to be concerned about shifting the standard of what it means to preempt and the way in which that might actually implicate other preemption doctrines and other laws?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> So, Your Honor, I think -- I think the real concern would be adopting the view of preemption from my friend, which doesn't really seem to line up with the more disciplined and text-based approach that this Court traditionally  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, I -- we can --</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> -- takes in the preemption context.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Let's say we reject saying there's something about Felder that is focused on exhaustion. I'm looking at Felder as  a preemption case that has a standard that talks about the inconsistency with the purposes of the  federal statute -- MR. LACOUR:  Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- is it an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution?  And I got to tell you, in the Concepcion case in AT&T versus Mobility, that exact same concept is governing what the Court is doing with respect to preemption. So, if we move from that, if we're focused more on minimizing liability or whatever else you say you think Felder means, I'm worried that that's going to bleed over into these other kinds of preemption areas.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Your Honor, what I'd say to that is, why was the law an obstacle?  And the text answers that question. State officials shall be liable. What's the state law do? Minimizes liability. So there is your text-based preemption problem right there on the face of the statute.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It's not in the text of the statute.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Shall be liable --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Minimizing liability is not in --</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Correct. But the  -- the law at issue there was part of a broader liability scheme -- the Felder Court recognized this  --that was enacted after Wisconsin had done away with judicial immunity. The Wisconsin Supreme Court had done away with judicial immunity. And so this new immunity statute was enacted that had damages caps and also had this notice of claims requirement. Wisconsin extolled this as a way to minimize liability. So there wasn't really a question as to what the law was doing. But  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> You believe that plaintiffs here could have brought suit immediately in federal court, is that right?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Yes, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So, I mean, this is Felder's  --it seems to me there's a lot going on in Felder. But one -- its most essential holding is it quotes Patsy, and it says -- you know, Patsy said, too bad about an exhaustion requirement. You have to be able to bring suit  in federal court immediately. And then  -- and this is on page 147 -- it said should there be any different rule with respect to state courts, and it says, given the evil at which the federal civil rights legislation was aimed, there's simply no reason to suppose that Congress meant to have that kind of distinction. So, I mean, that seems just like a very clear -cut understanding of Felder, that once we say that the exhaustion requirement does not preclude suit in state courts, we understand --does not preclude suit in federal court, we understand 1983 to do the same thing with respect to state courts.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Your Honor, even if I grant you that, this is still a jurisdictional rule, and you've still said in Howlett and Haywood that neutral jurisdictional rules are a valid excuse to keeping federal claims out. So, even if there is some get-to-court-immediately element of 1983, our -- our courts do not exercise jurisdiction over that type of claim.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito? Justice Sotomayor? Justice Kagan?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Your friend on the other side said, if it went to federal court, there might be a ripeness issue and an abstention issue. What are your thoughts?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> I think that is -- that's likely true. We've seen that in a lot of courts of appeals decisions. We cited Cotton v. Jackson as a -- I think it's a 2011 circuit decision, where they lost on the merits for not taking advantage of the process and running to federal court too soon.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. And I take your point that -- as I understand it, it's -- your argument is it's hard for this to be  -- an exhaustion requirement of administrative agency processes to be an obstacle that's improper given that the federal government has similar administrative exhaustion requirements. But there does seem to be a tremendous record of difficulty of  --of individuals accessing that administrative process here. What assurance do you have or can you give us that  --that  --that the State is addressing these claims in -- in a proper and timely manner?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Yes, Your Honor, two points. The reason we point to the federal analog is to show that this really does concern competence over the subject matter, like the Court has discussed in Howlett and Haywood. And then, as to assurances that the State is taking this seriously -- this is obviously outside of the record because we're at the motion to dismiss stage  -- but we have tripled the number of hearing officers we have from eight to 25, and we have greatly reduced the backlog. I think, in -- in January of 2022, that backlog of people who had waited at least 21 days for a hearing was up to over 131,000. Today, it's down to about 7,410, and we anticipate clearing that backlog by the end of the year.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Was some of that backlog due to COVID or -- or other things?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Absolutely, Your Honor. I think a million additional unemployment claims. And then, of course, when you have COVID, it makes it harder to  --to hire people and makes it harder to retain people too during the height of the pandemic.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?  Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> I asked Mr. Unikowsky about the state statute of limitations. I'm going to ask you the same question. When does the state statute of limitations start running on these claims?  And to clarify, my concern is, if somehow the state statute of limitations is running, you know, because the due process violation has already begun in the agency, is it  the case that that statute of limitations might run in state, for purposes of state court, before they can even get there?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Your Honor, of course, this hasn't been briefed. I -- I don't think  that would be an issue because, I mean, the due process violation is incomplete until the process has run out. So I -- I think -- and, certainly, if they were to appeal out of the agency proceeding directly to the circuit court, there wouldn't be any statute of limitations problem in that situation either.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Okay. My other question is:  So a couple times in your brief you called the agency proceeding a proper proceeding for redress under 1983, and you said there's no reason for this Court to distinguish between bringing a 1983 claim in something that's called a court versus sending it to an agency. Is that somehow different than the exhaustion requirement?  Can you just  --</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> I think, Your Honor --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> -- explain to me what you're saying?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> -- our --our point there is that we think the language suggests that there is a great deal of discretion for the states in terms of structuring their adjudicatory processes. And, in this instance, we have the agency first functioning sort of as an adjunct. They compile a useful record. That can then go up for the circuit court to -- to review with de novo review. And that -- that's particularly helpful for uncounseled claimants who maybe don't have a lot of means because they just lost their job. They can go through this informal process, have a record. They don't have to go through formal discovery and have a lawyer to have that record when they do get to the circuit court.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So is the argument  --I mean, I guess I'm trying to distinguish between an exhaustion requirement, which is almost kind of like a pregame thing, you know, it's a -- it's a threshold. And this makes it sound like, if you're saying this is part of the 1983 claim itself or part of the adjudication, it's  actually not a delay of the 1983 claim. But is your argument instead that this is actually part of adjudicating the constitutional violatio n?</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Your Honor, we  --we do think it's advancing the purposes of 1983, which are sort of remedial in ensuring that federal rights are not being violated. But  it's not a 1983 claim inside of the agency.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Okay. So that's  -- okay. I just wanted to make sure I understood your argument. Thank you.</text><speaker>Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?  Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>Edmund G.

5,2024.23-217-t01,"<speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  For over a century, this Court has held that the default standard in civil cases is preponderance of the evidence. That default rule should resolve this case. Nothing in the text suggests that Congress intended a clear and convincing evidence standard to apply to the 34 exemptions under the Fair Labor Standard  -- Fair Labor Standards Act. Respondent  --Respondents argue that a heightened standard is appropriate because FLSA rights are important. But a preponderance standard applies to rights against race discrimination and disability discrimination and rights to organize and to workplace safety, all super-important rights. This Court has reserved the clear and convincing standard to deprivations by the government of critical rights that don't involve money damages. This Court has never allowed plaintiffs to use a clear and convincing  standard as a sword, and it certainly has never read a clear and convincing standard into a statute for money damages. Respondents also argue that overtime rights aren't waivable. But waivability and standards of proof are unrelated and don't go hand in hand. Waivability goes to who owns the right, the government or the individual, and the standard of proof goes to how hard it is to prove that the right attaches in the first place. Thus, the preponderance of the evidence standard governs non-waivable rights, such as those under the NLRA and OSHA, and heightened standards govern waivable rights, such as those in criminal trials and deportation hearings. Because the court below applied only the clear and convincing standard, we think this Court should remand for the application of the preponderance standard. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> We'll hear argument next in Case 23-217, E.M.D. Sales versus Carrera. Ms. Blatt.</text><speaker>Lisa S.

I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Other than in the context of actual malice, can you think of any  other case where there has been a requirement, this Court has required clear and convincing that  --where only money damages were at issue?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. The only example we would say is in the water rights cases, where  there are sovereigns. So I don't think --</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --that's really money damages. But, in those apportionment cases, this Court has long held clear and convincing applies in -- in cases between sovereigns.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> How would you respond -- what do you have to say about Respondents' public/private right or private/public right argument?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure, a couple things. I mean, I do think public nature goes to the waivability, and as my opening talked about, that's a distinct issue in terms of standard of proof. But, more importantly, the public has an equal interest in the accurate implementation of the Act, and this Court in Encino said the exemptions are equally a part of the statute. And the public has an interest in making sure, if it's more likely than not an employee doesn't fall within a category and should be exempt, then, under a clear and convincing standard, that employee may be required to pay overtime even when the purposes of the statute are not  only not  --not invoked, but they're counterproductive because it imposes very unjustified costs, particularly under small businesses.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> How are we supposed to  -- you make the argument that the higher standard applies in, you know, termination of parental rights and all that. But how are we supposed to make the judgment that the concern to remediate dire labor situations when this Act was passed are similarly worthy of a heightened standard?  You know, the disparity in, you know, barga ining power between the people who are seeking the wages and the employer and all that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah, all  --of course, all, you know, good points. 1938, though, we cite these cases from both, the 1877 and 1914, the Lilienthal's Tobacco and the Regan case involving civil penalties. And one was just  -- and it cites, you know, centuries' worth of precedent -- or treatises saying the preponderance standard is the back  --the background presumption. And I do think the government makes a good point that in the original Act, there was -- Congress did speak to a standard of proof. It was in an administrative context for minimum wages, and Congress provided for a preponderance of the evidence standard for the administrator of the Wage and Hour Division to exempt certain categories. So we think the government is correct that that is at least some indication that Congress thought a preponderance of the evidence standard. But the more basic presumption is just when you look at all these statutes, Title VII, disability, NLRA, I mean, there's plenty of cases in the labor context, NLRA, OSHA, all those arguments could be made, and the preponderance standard has always governed.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, how do we apply the particularly important individual  interest then in thinking about the cases that have had a heightened standard because they seem to distinguish cases involving mere money?  I think that's the phrase. But, when it's minimum wage, it's not mere money in the same way, I  guess, to follow up on the Chief Justice's question. How are we supposed to make those  value judgments, I guess?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Are you saying  -- and, relatedly, are you saying we should never expand the category of where we've done clear and convincing, the Addington category?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Or are you saying that this is different in kind from the Addington category that  --where we have  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- applied a heightened standard?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So both. Let's be clear, I think there's only two ways to get there. You have to do it by the Constitution, which is Addington, or the statute. And it's true that  the 1966 case would be where this Court said congressional silence means it's left up to the judiciary to make an independent determination about these kinds of things. But starting with Grogan and certainly by the time of Octane Fitness and Halo, this Court has basically treated it as an absolute sort of we look at congressional silence and that's dispositive. Now I will say that I've not been able to think of  a statutory right where Congress has not addressed a burden of proof that involves a deprivation up to, like, deportation and denaturalization, which were the two examples where this Court read it in, but if this Court wanted to leave that open, I don't think you need to do it as a ""well, we'll just throw up our hands and do what we want,"" but more of a background presumption against which Congress legislates. Congress presumably knows, in the '40s and '50s, you set out a kind of rule that if it was a particularly important deprivation, not involving money damages, then the Court will read into a clear and convincing evidence. But I don't think -- I do think it is a question of congressional intent ultimately. And, again, I  -- I have not been able to think of an example. And I think it is significant that Congress has both codified, superseded, and overruled the deportation and denaturalization contexts. Congress went in  and, you know, very carefully said when it wanted clear and convincing in deportation, overruled it in the denaturalization. It's hard for me to think of a case involving a deprivation of an interest that comes close to the Constitution, like the, you know, civil commitment or -- or right to -- to your children, that doesn't involve money damages. And I don't think it's -- it would be right to go down to overtime, which I think involves highly compensated employees, and to go down this road of, well, how important is race discrimination as opposed to sex discrimination or religious discrimination and start saying these are semi -fundamental rights too and Price Waterhouse already put this to bed and said we're going to have a preponderance of the evidence standard.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Can I just ask a practical question?  You asked us to vacate and remand. The SG wants us to reverse, which  usually suggests to me that they think the judgment below can't be sustained under any reading. And the other side says, regardless of the standard, affirm. Our practice is to  remand. But what outcome could a different standard of proof have on the factual findings in this case?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So let me address just sort of the  -- I don't think at least we intended any difference between vacatur and reversal. We just copied what the Court did in the Starbucks case because it involved a similar misapplication, so we just took identically what you said in your opinion. I don't think the government's  --I think the government and -- and we both just think send it back. In terms of no  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well, I don't disagree just for a moment. I do think the other side says this was harmless error.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Of course.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right?  So I don't think we should get into that. The court below should. But I'm asking you, why isn't it harmless  error?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right, yeah. So we think the ultimate  --we think there's more than ample evidence for the Court to find and will find below by a preponderance of the evidence. And the main reason -- and the regulation is cited at page 43A of the Pet. App. -- that whether your primary duty is one of making sales -- this is an outside salesman -- it's not the time spent, but it's the most important, i.e., the character and time spent is one factor but not dispositive. And the four things that we would point to  --and I think, again, the evidence is -- is great for us  -- one, it's the testimony of the CEO, which is that just when she started the business, your job is to make sales. It's to push that inventory and to increase the product. And, second, there were three salesmen that said that the sky was the limit for them and their ability to make sales at chain stores and they lost track. Third, there was testimony of the Walmart former buyer for sauces and dressings and either he or she  --I can't remember  -- said that planograms, which are basically your floor plans for your inventory shelf, that those were honored in the breach. It's true that the Safeway and Giant people said we can't control  where we put the food, but the Walmart person said:  Listen, sometimes we let them, you know, sell us more tortillas or whatever they were selling and get more space. And finally, and the fourth one, and I think it is important at least to our client in terms of common sense, they are called sales representatives, and the collective bargaining unit designated them as such, and nobody complained about overtime. So this was a, you know, longstanding provision in the  -- in --in the CBA. So I think all of those things would lead to a sufficient basis. And the only way this Court could find harmless error, of course, would be to find that no reasonable fact finder could find by a preponderance of the evidence.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> On the last issue you raised, which was the collective bargaining  issue, this right of o vertime is not waivable by an employee, correct?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Correct, prospectively, yes.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you're not using it in that sense.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, not at all.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You're using it in the sense of what they perceived as the most important part of their function?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely correct, that it was just the union, you know  --and they were paid on a commission basis. It necessarily wasn't based on new sales. So this is more completely atmospherically inconsistent with their title, not in any way  -- not in any way binding.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> The court of appeals here applied its own circuit precedent. What's your understanding of where that circuit precedent came from, how it arose?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I mean, it arose a long time ago relying on Tenth Circuit precedent. And to be fair to the Fourth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit did say in that decision, it was talking about who had the burden, but it did say the  employer would have to put clear and affirmative proof forward. And then later the Tenth Circuit said: But what we meant by that was not clear and convincing evidence. We were just  -- you know, you weren't supposed to take us literally. We just meant you have  -- the burden is on the employer, but it's just a preponderance of the evidence. And the Fourth Circuit just never deviated from it. They have been asked twice en banc to overrule it, and they've declined twice to overrule it.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But it -- it relied only on the Tenth Circuit opinion --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- not on our cases?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Correct, yeah, just the Tenth Circuit. Now -- and I don't think -- again, we tried en banc, and I don't think the Fourth Circuit has ever articulated a rule. And it is somewhat noteworthy that they've only applied it -- I mean, they're doing it in the overtime case too, which seems, you know, the least policy basis for it. And the only other thing I just want to say on the preponderance of the evidence is the district court said just in the connection of the hearing, there's a lot to be said on the  liability question. Obviously, a throwaway. The district court's going to make its own independent decision on remand, but we don't think there's anything that could be said where this Court sitting as -- as nine members would find that no reasonable fact finder could conclude that a preponderance of the evidence wasn't satisfied.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I ask you, you started off by saying that the default standard of proof was the preponderance of the evidence standard and that it's a matter of cong ressional intent, and so I guess the question is how clear was it as of 1938, when the FSLA was passed, that preponderance of the evidence was the standard of proof as a default? The cases  -- many of the cases that are cited are actually post-1938 cases. So what's the best evidence that Congress was actually legislating against the preponderance of the evidence standard?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> In that Footnote 2, where we list all the cases, there are only two cases to be sure that were pre-1938. It's the Lilienthal's Tobacco from 1877, I think, and United States versus Regan, which is 1914. But that case is a civil penalties case, when it was basically saying, even though you're hit with these civil penalties, you could be subject to a criminal law, preponderance of the evidence standard applies. Now, in Regan, what the Court did was not only cite treatises, but it canvassed state law and federal cases. In the Lilienthal's Tobacco, it just cited two treatises, and I think those treatises are -- I don't know. I have the dates, but they're in the 1800s, and they're Wigmore and whoever else the famous evidence person is.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And it was general civil litigation?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And so, you know, the civil penalties. So it's just  -- and then, besides just those treatises and the two Supreme Court cases, it's the -- I think the government  did make a good argument that Congress, when it thought about the issue in the administrative context, said it thought preponderance of the  evidence was sufficiently protective of workers in the minimum wage context, which I think is a little more sympathetic for the worker, so it's worse for the other side. An d I'm -- I don't -- oh, go ahead.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Nobody?  Okay.

Respondents' claim seeking monetary remedies for alleged violations of the FLSA's overtime requirements is not remotely comparable to those cases. Respondents don't really argue otherwise. Instead, they offer an assortment of policy reasons for favoring employee interests, but the policies promoted by the FLSA are materially similar to workplace protections like those in Title VII that this Court has recognized are adequately protected by the  default standard of proof.

Brown</speaker><text> So I think that the policy in  -- in support of minimum wage is certainly an important policy. I would say that the same standard would apply in that context. It's still a claim for money damages. And in that context, I think the statutory history that we cite on pages 14 and 15 of our brief would be even more relevant, where Congress did make the judgment in the minimum wage context that the preponderance of the evidence standard would apply for the exception when the administrator was  -- was making that determination. So I think the same -- the same standard would -- would be applicable there.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Did I understand your opening to -- to say that if  it's just money, you wouldn't address the clear and convincing standard at all?</text><speaker>Aimee W. Brown</speaker><text> So the way that this Court has framed the -- the test here, essentially, is that the  --the deprivation needs to be a significant deprivation. And it has never applied outside of the First Amendment context the  -- the clear and convincing evidence standard when it's just money damages. And so I think as a general matter that the presumption is at its strongest when you're in a case dealing with conventional remedies, like money damages, injunctive relief, things like that. The very, very narrow category of cases in which this Court has departed from the default standard without a constitutional backdrop is in these deportation, denaturalization, and expatriation cases, where there's a coercive government action that's being taken.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But what do we do about the fact that the money damages here are actually, I thought, doing more significant work than just providing damages in that particular scenario?  So, I mean, when Congress enacted the FSLA  --the FLSA, they talked about the fact that there were interests at stake that were beyond money damages, that setting up the statute in the way that they did ensured that  businesses don't gain a competitive advantage by misclassifying employees. It protects certain groups from substandard wages and thereby protecting health and well -being. There was also the notion of spreading employment through the application of this law. So isn't this more than just money damages?  I mean, I take your point that it might not be denaturalization, but I would think the government would say the interests go beyond just pure money damages.</text><speaker>Aimee W. Brown</speaker><text> Certainly, we recognize there are very important policy interests at stake in this case and in the FLSA and that Congress legislated with those in mind. I think the same thing is true for Title VII. It's not just about the individual employee who's seeking damages. It's about the broader interest in  eradicating discrimination from the workplace. Congress often makes these policy findings in its statutes where it lays out all  of the interests that are at stake here, an d those can be addressed through a variety of  means, for example, through this waivability issue or waivability aspect of the statute where it can't be waived. And so that is how some of those policy concerns are addressed. But the heightened standard of proof has just never been used as the kind of tool that would -- that would be addressed in those kinds of instances. Otherwise, I think it would  -- it would risk making that standard no longer -- the preponderance of the evidence may no longer be the default standard in those cases because those kinds of interests are  --are very frequently at stake when Congress is legislating. I -- I wanted to just make a couple -- a couple of points if there are no further questions on  --on that. The Respondents have -- have asserted the variety of reasons to depart from the default here, and the Court has never accepted those kinds of reasons in cases dealing with conventional remedies. And I think  it's important here to note that no court has actually accepted them because the Fourth Circuit here, as Ms. Blatt already discussed, did not actually come up with any reasoned basi s for the decision. It -- it misconstrued this earlier precedent, but it never tried to reconcile the heightened standard of proof with the Court's precedents here and with the -- the very narrow set of circumstances in which the Court has suggested that it would be appropriate. So the -- the reasons that Respondents have provided here are generally the policy interests in  --in -- in overtime requirements, which, again, we agree are important, but other statutes also implicate very important reasons. And, as this Court held in Grogan, I think the exemptions here are also a part of the congressional policy and are also a part of what Congress was doing when it was balancing the interests here.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I ask you, is this the same standard of proof that would apply  to the government, the Department of Labor, if it is bringing suit to enforce the FLSA?</text><speaker>Aimee W. Brown</speaker><text> Yes, it's the same standard of proof.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And it's the same standard that the Department of Labor applies in its own administrative proceedings?</text><speaker>Aimee W. Brown</speaker><text> So the Department of Labor does it  -- the Department of Labor enforces this statute through district court litigation.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Through the courts.</text><speaker>Aimee W. Brown</speaker><text> So it would always  be the -- the same standard. OPM  -- there are other administrative  --OPM administers it for the government on behalf of  --of government employees, and those go through litigation as well and the same standard.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Does the government have an idea of how often the standard of proof is dispositive in a case like this or any other?</text><speaker>Aimee W. Brown</speaker><text> It's difficult to say. I mean, the amicus and  --and the parties here have tried to kind of point to various cases where they think the standard may or may not have been dispositive. In the Department of  Labor's cases, its own litigation, where -- where we might have more of an idea, the standard of proof I think is -- is pretty rarely dispositive, but that's likely because most of the litigation in the context of the Department  of Labor is about the interpretation of an exemption or, you know, whether an employer is -- an employee is  -- is covered by the FLSA at all, whether they are an employee or an independent contractor. So, in those cases, in the cases that the Department has  --has litigated, I don't think it often makes a huge difference, but it certainly can make a difference in edge cases here, and I think that the Petitioners should be given the opportunity to show that this is one of those cases.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And one final question  --oh, sorry.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> No, go ahead.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I was just going to say, finally, is the government taking the position that this same standard should apply to all of the exemptions?</text><speaker>Aimee W. Brown</speaker><text> Yes. I don't think that there's any reasoned basis to distinguish among the exemptions. If there were a different background rule in place, maybe when a different  exemption was enacted, then you might think that Congress had a different rule in mind. But this has been the longstanding background presumption since, you know, 1878 in Lilienthal's Tobacco, even before that, I think. In Lilienthal's Tobacco, it's kind of stated as though it were already a well-established rule. And so I don't think that there's any basis for concluding that -- that Congress would have had something different in mind for any of the different exemptions.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Just going back to Justice Sotomayor's question, is there any difference between your recommendation to reverse and Ms. Blatt's to vacate?</text><speaker>Aimee W. Brown</speaker><text> No. We originally, at the certiorari stage, had recommended a summary reversal, and that's just kind of the colloquialism that this Court uses for deciding cases without full merits briefing, and so we kind of just used that same formulation when we were making our -- our -- our argument here as well. But we don't think that the Court needs  to reach out and decide whether or not the actual evidence here was sufficient to show that the employees fell within the exemption.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What  --what happens when the case goes back?  I mean, you've got a factual record. Does the court just say  I'm going to look at this under predominance rather than clear and convincing, or do you -- I mean, is  --you don't -- I guess I don't see how you would have different evidentiary proceedings given the standard of proof, so  --</text><speaker>Aimee W. Brown</speaker><text> Right. My understanding would be that the court of appeals would likely just remand this also back to the district court that was making --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Aimee W. Brown</speaker><text> -- the --the individual factual findings. And because this was a bench trial, the district court will have the full -- the full transcript, the full -- all of the evidence that was put in at that point. And then the district court will just make the determination and will -- will follow up.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> So the district court is going to look at this and say, well, I evaluated this under clear and convincing and decided this, but if it's just preponderance, it comes out the other way?</text><speaker>Aimee W. Brown</speaker><text> It could make that determination. As the Petitioners note, the district court did cite the standard of proof several different times in its decision and mentioned it during the argument as well. And so there is a possibility that the court would -- would reach that determination, and we should at least allow the court to -- to have the opportunity to do so.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Is it your position on this record that there is the potential, evidentiary potential, of a different outcome?</text><speaker>Aimee W. Brown</speaker><text> We haven't taken a position on  --on whether the -- whether the right outcome here under the preponderance of the evidence standard is to find an exemption or not. I do think that the -- the lower court should be given that opportunity. We don't think that there's anything we've seen so far to absolutely foreclose that. But, again, we -- we haven't taken a position on what the overall  outcome here should be.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Aimee W. Brown</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Thank you -- I'm sorry. Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Should we just draw a clear line and say, when a higher standard of proof is not required by the Constitution and there is no liberty interest at stake, then the standard is  --we -- we presume conclusively that the standard is preponderance?</text><speaker>Aimee W. Brown</speaker><text> So I don't think that there is any need to take -- take that kind of further step, particularly in this case. This isn't an area where there has been a lot of confusion among the lower courts as to how this Court's standards apply. There are not a lot of other cases in which we're seeing lower courts applying a heightened standard of proof, absent statutory text or absent the case falling into one of these categories that the Court has already addressed. So I don't think it's necessary to do that. I will also say that I think that the Court's case in -- the Court's decision in Grogan goes pretty far towards saying something  like that. It says essentially that statutory silence is inconsistent with the presumption or with the understanding that Congress would have intended a heightened standard of proof. And the only way I think that presumption is overcome is if it is a significant deprivation, which, again, has really been limited to those kind of three cases that I talked about, deportation, denaturalization, and expatriation. So I don't think it's necessary to kind of take that further step. I  -- there's not, like, a lot of confusion in the lower courts on that point.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, then  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> -- what methodology do you think we should apply in determining whether economic interests are particularly important under the test?</text><speaker>Aimee W. Brown</speaker><text> So I  -- I think that you should apply the same presumption that you've applied in every other case, including in Grogan, which is that when there is a  conventional remedy in civil litigation, the very, very strong presumption is that the preponderance of the evidence standard is going to apply. And this Court has never recognized  or never seen a case in which that is the -- the -- the -- the lay of the land, and that would nevertheless overcome that presumption. And there  -- there may be a time in which there are, like, common-law background principles that would inform the way the statute is interpreted. That was the case, for example, in Microsoft versus i4i, where Congress did not specifically say that the preponderance -- or that the clear and convincing evidence standard should apply, but there was a background common -law principle that in patent invalidity cases, a patent's invalidity has to be shown by clear and convincing evidence, and that informed the way the Court read the statute.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Aimee W. Brown</speaker><text> So, certainly, I would want to leave that open as well.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Anyone else?  No? Thank you, counsel. Ms. Bateman.</text>"

I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Ms. Ho, could you focus just briefly on the $100 million that the  government says it contributes or provides. That  --much of that is collected under a debt collection provision that authorizes the  government to collect its -- a debt owed to it. That seems somewhat at odds with your argument that it's not the government's money. How could it be collected under that Act if it is not owed to the government?  And if -- if it is owed to the government, then why isn't it the government's money after that?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yes, Justice Thomas, and let me answer both parts of your question. Let me begin by addressing the debt settlement and restitution. Those funds are no different than the E-rate contributions themselves. They are owed to the Administrative Company. The United States just collects and returns those funds to their private owner. A  --a -- a good analogy is like child support. Like a parent provides child support even when the United States  withholds from the parent's income and sends to the other parent, the private telecom carriers provide E-rate funds even when the United States collects their delinquent debts, just like when  a private litigant uses a sheriff to go after a property to pay judgment. Now let -- Justice Thomas, let me address directly your question about the Debt Collection Improvement Act. And those debts don't belong to the government, even under the Debt Collection Improvement Act, for three reasons. Number one, that's a different statutory scheme with different language. That's the Blanca case from the Tenth Circuit that we cite in our brief. The FCA limits a claim to money that the United States provides, and the Debt Collection Improvement Act defines ""claim"" more expansively without regard to its effect on the public fisc. And, number two, relatedly, the Debt Collection Improvement Act applies to funds that the United States is authorized by statute to collect for the benefit of any person. That is Section 3701(b)(1)(D). So money belongs to the  person for whose benefit the government collects it. The government just holds it in trust. And that's in our brief on page 32. And my friend, the Solicitor General, admits on page 17 of the Solicitor General's brief that they are obligated, the government is obligated, to transmit funds back to the Administrative Company.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> The -- the --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I ask you a question  --oh. Sorry.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> I was just -- the government, though, treats this, these funds, as appropriated funds, right?  They -- they're  --as I understand it, they're called backdoor appropriations?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> You're correct, Mr. Chief Justice, that OMB and the President's budget have  --have labeled the E-rate funds as -- I think they're -- I think the -- the bureaucratic term is ""permanent indefinite appropriations,"" but even  --even OMB, in using that term, admitted that -- I think -- I think the language used was that the line between the private sector and government can be murky and that it was including those funds in the budget out of a desire to be  --to be comp rehensive. So, ultimately, it is this Court's responsibility to interpret this statute and determine what the nature of the funds are. So  bookkeeping labels aren't dispositive of that question, Mr. Chief Justice.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But I guess I'm wondering why the government isn't collecting the money here for a public purpose for the funding of this program. You suggest that the money belongs to the person for whom the government collects the funds, and I thought the funds were being collected to operate this government program.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> So, Justice Jackson, I take your question to be focused on, you know, isn't -- isn't money that the government collects -- which, of course, we know the government isn't actually collecting the money here. The private carriers are paying their money  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right. I was just responding --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> --to another private person.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah, I was just -- I was just trying to understand your response to Justice Thomas, who said  --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- we have a hundred million dollars that the government is collecting, admittedly, as a result of settlements and debt collection, in the context  of this program, but, ultimately, the reason why the money is being collected is because the government has ordered telecom companies to fund this government program. So the ultimate beneficiary, I would think, is the public, right?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> So we know, Your Honor, from the text of the False Claims Act and its definition of ""claim"" that just having a government purpose isn't enough and that the -- the precise language  --and this is 3729(b)(2)(A). It defines a claim, and it says, ""if the money or property is to be spent or used on the government's behalf or to advance a government program or interest,"" which is what you're asking me about, ""and if the United States provides or has provided any portion of the money or property.""  So it's not enough that --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So I guess I don't understand your argument about ""provides.""  Can  you help me?  Because it seems to me that you're saying that because the government here has ordered these telecom companies to pay directly  into the fund, it is not ""provides,"" but if the government had ordered the telecom companies to pay them a fee, for example, and then directed that into the fund, it would be ""provides.""  And I guess I don't understand why that distinction should make a difference.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yes. And the  -- the distinction is critical, and the distinction is that under the scenario as Congress and the political branches designed it, the public fisc is never put at risk. The money goes from the private carriers --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But I guess I'm thinking never --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text>--to the private fund.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- even --in either scenario, the public fisc is not really put at risk. I mean, you have this pot of money that's the public fisc, and in my second scenario, the government is exacting a fee from the telecom companies, and while it mi ght be put into the public fisc for two seconds, the point is  they're exacting the fee to pay for this fund. What difference does it make if they're doing it that way versus just telling the telecom companies you put it into the fund  directly?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> I  -- I think that the key -- the key difference for False Claims Act purposes is that in the first scenario, even -- even if the money is only in the public fisc for a limited amount of time, that is still endangering the public fisc. It is going into the public fisc, and the government is providing the funds out of the public  -- of the public fisc. And -- and the political branches, Congress and the FCC, in choosing this rather unique setup, this design, did that quite intentionally --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Didn't they do it  --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> --to protect this  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- intentionally to avoid the cost, the administrative cost, of it  -- the government being the one -- I mean, what's so peculiar about your argument to me is  that I would think good government would actually be trying to hold down costs. We have this program we've created, and it seems far more efficient to have the telecom companies just put the money in directly than it does to say:  Give the money to us, and then we will in cost  --you know, incur the costs of rerouting it out to the fund.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> And  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I don't understand why that's a problematic thing from your perspective.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Oh, we don't think it's a  -- it's problematic. We just think those choices, which, as -- as you --as you lay out, may have been  for very sound reasons, those choices have consequences, and the consequence of that choice to insulate the public fisc and perhaps to gain some efficiency in doing it this way  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Means that it can  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> But, Ms. Ho --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- be defrauded from your  --your perspective under the FCA?  The FCA doesn't apply in that situation?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> We believe that the FCA does not apply, but there are -- there are plenty of tools in the toolbox to  --to safeguard the administrative fund from  --from fraud.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Ho, can I ask you a question?  It seems like your argument  rests on the premise that only one person can provide, and I'm not really sure why that's true. I was thinking of an example of  -- think back to the days when  proctors used to give out test booklets and pencils. So let's say that I'm working as a proctor. It would be perfectly natural for me to say to the students: I'm going to provide each of you with a pencil and a booklet. Now I didn't go out and purchase those with my own money. The school presumably provided them to me and then I provided them to the students. I mean, I think one person doesn't have to provide. I think we could say that the United States provided funds, for example, that it  -- this hundred million dollars that it got through debt collection, et cetera, and then also say that the carriers provided money to the funds through their fees or that the carriers provided funds to the United States, which was a conduit. I just don't understand. I mean, are you assuming that ""provides"" has to be  exclusive, that there's one ultimate provider?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> In this case, yes, Your Honor, because we look at the two parties that are involved, the -- who are --who are providing it. And the statute says the government has to provide the money. So my disagreement with my friends on the other side with their reading of ""provides"" is how that is provided. So our position is you can't provide funds by making -- making someone else provide the funds, and you don't provide funds when someone else acts as a conduit --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, why not?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> But they  --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> -- for those funds.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, I had the same sort of question that Justice Barrett did, a different example. If I have a sick friend and I arrange  for Uber to bring that sick friend chicken soup, I mean, in some ways, it's the deliveryman who  provides the soup, but I provided the soup because I paid for it and I told the deliveryman to go deliver it. And so, here, you might have two people that could in some sense be said to furnish or supply or provide the soup.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Justice Kagan, I would say in your  --in your hypothetical that you are providing the funds, you're providing the funds that then is used to -- to transmit the soup or  -- or the ride.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, I think my friend --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> And that  --and that's what  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- would thank me for giving her the soup, not the funds, you know?  I mean  --I mean, I think my friend would understand that the Uber guy was a kind of conduit and it went through  -- but -- but -- but -- but I ordered the soup. And, here, the mandate is coming from the federal government in the same way.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> And  -- and, Justice Kagan, I think your hypothetical gets it exactly right when you say that your friend would thank -- would thank you. The thank you note would go to  you, Justice Kagan, right, because you provided the funds that then in turn led --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And so too I think  --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> --to how it gets achieved down the  --down the way.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- the school might say:  Thank you to Congress and the FCC for setting up this program that enables us to, you know, get these services in our schools, because everybody understands that the carriers aren't doing from the goodness of their hearts. Everybody understands that the carriers are doing it because the U.S. government, the Congress, the FCC, and then  -- and then the particular administrative entity that's been set up pursuant to the statutory scheme, you know, that's -- you know, that's where the directive is coming from. That's who's responsible for schools getting what they're getting.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yes. And Congress made the choice to set up the system to -- to deliver those -- those resources, those important  resources, and it made choices. It chose to require the private telecom carriers to pay. And the FCC made the choice to have a private administrator administer the system. And in that system that Congress designed, one consequence of that decision is  that the public funds, which is the  -- the cornerstone here of the False Claims Act, right, threat to the public fisc is never implicated, and so one consequence that flows from those choices is the fall  -- you -- you cannot have a False Claims Act. But, as I was -- as I was talking with Justice Jackson about, that does not mean that the fund is left without protections. There are a toolbox of tools, everything from fees and fines to disbarment from the program.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> But, Ms. Ho, it doesn't say that the threat  --I mean, clearly, one purpose is to protect the public fisc.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> But, I mean, also protecting federal programs could be a purpose. I mean, so you can't rely just, I think, on that one purpose to narrow it. And it also seems at least for the post-2009 claims that there's some tension between  the addition saying that it doesn't matter if the money  --if the United States has title to the money or property, but defining it as public funds implies that is so.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Let me take both parts of your question, Justice Barrett. Let me start with your -- the -- the last part, the title clause. And I think the -- the title clause clarifies that the False Claims Act applies even if the United States no longer has title, present tense, to the money or property when the request is made. So a request for money that's been provided to  -- by the United States to a grantee is still a claim even though the grantee and not the United States holds title to the money when the request is made. And the -- the revised addition of the ""provides for"" clause strengthens that interpretation because Congress also amended that to say ""provides or has provided.""  So it's really a timing issue. And I would think, if Congress  --if Congress were going to sever the link between the False Claims Act and protecting the public fisc that has been its historic focus, it would not have done that  --it would not have taken that huge step through such an oblique way as to revising the title clause, which really is more about timing and doesn't sever the link between the public fisc and the FCA. And, Justice Barrett, let me take on your second question  --your second aspect of your question about the government  --the purpose and the interest here, and that gets back to what I was talking with Justice Jackson about. And the text of the False Claims Act really answers that because, in the revised  -- in the revisions, the amendments that were made in 2009, Congress specified:  If the money or property is to be spent or used on the government's behalf or to advance a government program or interest and if the United States provides or has provided any portion of the money. So, if -- if Congress wanted to sever this historic link between the False Claims Act and protecting the public fisc, the easiest way for it to do that would have been just to eliminate the ""provides"" clause altogether. And Congress didn't -- didn't do that. It adopted a very narrow amendment --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Do --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text>-- that was focused on the timing issue, not severing the -- the False Claims Act from the  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> On -- on Justice Thomas's question about the hundred million dollars  -- I want to focus on that as well for a minute -- what exactly makes something part of the public fisc, to use your terms, or makes something government funds, to use your term? What are the precise indicia?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Sure. I would say public money, money that is owed to the United States. So that would take in taxes, certainly, but also fees, say, that people pay the post office or customs that go into the public fisc. So I think the key  --the key -- the key indicia is that it's simply money that the government owns.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> From taxes or fees or fines?  No?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yes. If the money  --if it's -- if it's -- if it's money that's going from private pockets into the public fisc, into the government, the government owns that money and  the government can do with that money what it will. And by contrast --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> When you say ""owns the money,"" what are  --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Owns the money.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- what are the precise things we look at to determine whether the government ""owns the money""?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Sure. I think -- I think you would -- I think one way -- maybe one helpful way to look at it within --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And, again, I'm focused on the hundred million here.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yes. Maybe one helpful way to look at it within the False Claims Act context that our case arises in is it is -- it is money that -- that, if anything were to happen to that money, right, that that -- that  -- that the -- the incidence of that loss would be borne by the government. And, in our case, whether you're talking about the contributions or you're talking about the debt, the settlement, the restitution, all of which is owed to the  Administrative Company, all of which is being paid by the private carriers, and the government's role, as this Court said in the Cohn case, right, money or property that is just in the government's hands for temporary possession before it's being returned to its rightful owner is not public money or public funds or endange ring the public fisc --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> But couldn't you say that  --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> -- for purposes of the False Claims Act.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- about all public funds?  You know, taxes come in and then they go out to pay for government programs; in other words, the -- that's what I'm trying to distinguish. Most government money comes from taxes, some from fees --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- some from leases, et cetera.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> But it's coming in and going out.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> And it is -- and it is --it is the government, right, it is coming into the public fisc, right, and the government is then sending it out. And that is not -- that's the opposite  --that is what Congress did not want here. Congress wanted money coming into a private  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Right. On your broader argument, I get that. I'm still trying to get the hundred million. But I'm  -- I --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yes, I -- I think -- I think -- I think the way to think about that money is that is money just  -- it's no different than the contributions, Justice Kavanaugh.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> It is owed to the Admini strative Company, and the government is simply getting it and taking it back to its private owner. The government doesn't keep any of that money.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What  --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> So, if something were to happen to that money, all of the incidence of  loss would fall on the Administrative Company, which, by the way, cannot have -- does not have recourse to the Treasury for funds if it falls short. It has to go involve commercially --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What if we --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What if we don't agree with your treatment of the hundred million and think  -- agree with the government's view of the hundred million?  Is there any way that you  --any argument you have that that doesn't taint the 4 billion or whatever the number is?  In other words, if part of it is the whatever  --you know, hundred million over whatever the denominator is, does that mean you lose?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> So the plain text of the False Claims Act refers to ""any portion of the money.""  I do think that would have damages implications, right, because the remedial provision -- and I think this is actually  another structural cue why we're right about all of the money, the contributions and the money, that the  --that comes back to the company as a result of restitutions, debts, and settlements, is the remedial provision says a civil penalty  of not less than 5,000, not mo re than 10,000, plus three times the amount of damages which the government sustains. So, whether you're talking about the contributions coming in or you're talking about the contributions that weren't paid and that are coming back into the fund, the government did not sustain loss either  -- either way under any -- any of those -- those funds, and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Just to follow up the Chief Justice's question, you're not suggesting, are you, that there's some kind of  tracing requirement, that, you know, you have to find the dollar that came into the Treasury and see what happened to that exact dollar, because that wouldn't make much sense, would it?  So you're not suggesting that?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> No, I'm not suggesting that. That  --that sort of -- you might have a -- question like that along the damages prong, right, because you're looking at the damages  that the government sustains. That's the Custer Battles case, right, where the tracing was an issue in that.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> But, no, no.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Can you explain that</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And then  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Sorry. Please go ahead.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So one -- if I just could go back to what Justice Kavanaugh was asking you because, as I took Justice Kavanaugh's question, it was really like every time you tell me it comes in and it goes out, again, putting the rest of the money aside, but that a hundred million, it's just coming in and going out in the typical way money always comes in and goes out. And you said the loss doesn't fall on the government. But, in some sense, that's always true because the money is appropriated for some other thing, some other activity, and the loss falls on that other activity or purpose. So I guess I'm still searching for  what your answer is to Justice Kavanaugh's question.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Sure. And I -- I --I think the  -- the key to the debt settlements and restitutions is that they -- they are no different than the contributions that the carriers pay directly to the  Administrative Company and that the Administrative Company then disburses -- may I finish?</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Sure.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Thank you. It is simply -- it is money that belongs to the Administrative Company, owed to the Administrative Company, and that is brought back to, and that the -- the only role of t he government with respect to the -- the debts and the settlements and the restitution is to hold that in trust for its rightful owner. No different than when the government collects restitution in a criminal case, it holds that money in trust for the victim --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text>--who is the owner. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Your earlier answer suggests to me that you think you -- that this case won't end this matter unless we rule on the government  -- on the Respondent's first ground, that this is a government program in total, correct?  Because what you're  -- I think what you're saying is we  --if our ruling relies simply on the hundred million, that your next case is going to be:  Okay, I'll accept that, but I'm going to fight about whatever the recovery is under the False Claims Act. That's what you just said to me.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> I  --I -- I think -- I think what I was -- what I was -- what I was trying to say is the text of the False Claims Act reads that so long as any portion of the money in government -- is government funds. Our  -- our position is that the government doesn't provide a cent of the money at -- at all.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> If we say they provide at least a hundred million, is your argument going to be that recovery is limited to that hundred million or that recovery, assuming you go under the False Claims Act, that recovery is limited to a hundred million, or are you going to take this position you're now taking,  that the government hasn't suffered any harm so that nothing would come to the government?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Well, our -- our -- our position is that the government hasn't suffered any harm. If you  -- if you disagree and you hold that the government has provided any portion of that money, then, Justice Sotomayor, you're right, that then does  --that becomes a damages issue because the --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So this case doesn't end. Then you're going to argue that their damages have to be limited to a hundred million?  What are you going to argue?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Well, I think we would  -- you know, our position is that there is no fraud here at all. We would go -- we would go back and  -- and have -- have a trial. Our position is that there's -- there's no fraud here, period.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Assume there's a  finding of fraud, that you should have paid more -- you should have given them a greater discount than you did. So assume you  --you lose the fraud parts. Are we back to a case where you're  going to claim the damages are limited because?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, I think, if we're in a situation where we have  a trial on the claim, that would depend on what  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counsel, just ask my  --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> --like, what the  -- what the jury  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- answer my question.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> It would be  --it would be what  --whatever the jury finds in terms of damages, the lim it on that would be the amount of damages the government sustains, and that  -- that would depend on what the jury were to find in that case.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And you're saying there would be no damages because the  --the -- the fund got the hundred million from the government.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Our  -- our position is no fraud, no damages.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Thank you, Your Hono r.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Ms. Ho, I just want to follow up on that just so I understand. So assume you lose on the hundred million. It would be sent back.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And there would be a trial.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And let's assume you lose on the  -- on the -- on the merits of the trial. And I know those are unpleasant assumptions, but work with me a minute. I think you would have open to you two arguments. One, that the hundred million dollars is not traceable to the losses in this case because the funds didn't follow through. I assume you'd make that argument, is that correct?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yes, Justice.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And then I'm  -- I'm -- I'm detecting in your colloquy with Justice Sotomayor that you might make an additional argument that damages would be limited to a  hundred million dollars in any event, is that correct?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. Thank you.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yes. Thank you, Justice Gorsuch.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> In your brief, you mentioned constitutional avoidance, and I'm, I guess, having trouble connecting that argument to this case in the sense of how it would be any more or less unconstitutional if -- the overall scheme -- if we disagreed with you here. So can you connect that up?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Sure. So our  -- our position  --and, as -- as -- as you say, it's a constitutional avoidance argument that looks at the justification for a relator, right?  And so the relator has standing under this Court's decision in Stevens, right, because, in a sense, it  --it is the  -- the delegate of the government's injury, right, its proprietary injury, right, its pocketbook injury. So, in a case like ours, where the government hasn't sustained any loss, right, then that leaves the relator only with the government's sov ereign interest to go after violators of the law. So we --we agree that our  -- our argument in terms of constitutional avoidance doesn't  -- doesn't completely solve the problem, but we would urge the Court not to go further down the path and make the -- the situation worse by allowing a situation where a relator is only operating on the basis of the government's sovereign interest, which is the Article II problem  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> --that we raised. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> I want to follow up on the questions that Justice Sotomayor and Justice Gorsuch asked you, and let me just see  -- I just want to make sure. I don't -- I don't think I quite have your answer. So let's assume you lose on the hundred million dollars, and let's assume again that you lose at trial, and then it's a question of calculating the damages sustained. I can't really tell how damages sustained are measured here in this situation  where you have someone other than the government itself collecting or disbursing the funds. I saw one Fourth Circuit case that addressed that and that was it. So my question is:  I  --I don't think it would be a hundred million dollars, right, because that's not the allegation of -- maybe I'm wrong. I didn't think Wisconsin Bell was accused of shortchanging by overcharging by  a hundred million dollars. That's just  --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> -- not the government --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Okay. So I'm just picking a number. Let's say it's $20,000. If that money -- if the government itself had been directly defrauded of that money and you had treble damages, it would be $60,000. I think what -- what -- if I -- if -- I have the same question that they do. My question is:  If you get to that point and  you're trying to calculate damages sustained to the government, are you going to say:  Yeah,  it's 60,000 once you treble it, just like it would be if they were dealing directly with the government?  Or would you say:  No, we have to calculate the marginal cost to the government in some kind of way?  Or you might say:  It's zeroed out. Like, the government didn't actually sustain any damage here. And so then it doesn't mean that the relator gets nothing because then there are other penalties and fines that are available under the FCA. That's my question.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Justice Barrett, let me take a  step back and say I think that the discussions that we've been having highlight the mismatch here and show why the government couldn't possibly have provided the funds at issue  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Okay. But assume you lose that.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> -- including  --including the  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Assume you lose that.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> If we lose that, then what that means -- all that means is that we have a claim, right?  The relator has a claim. And it  would certainly be the relator's job, assuming this gets to trial, to prove up damages and the jury's job then to decide what it is.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Right, right, right.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> So I think the mismatch --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> But is the relevant number that the relator, in your view, would be aiming at the $20,000 that I'm hypothesizing, or would it be some marginal cost to the government, or, as a matter of law, for a jury instruction, would you be saying, you know, it' s zero because the government didn't actually suffer any loss?  Even though the government provided the hundred million dollars, the damages sustained to the government were none?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> I think the way I would answer that, Justice Barrett, is to  -- to look to the text of the remedial provision, which refers to damages that the government sustains. And so it would be the relator's job at trial to prove that amount, whatever that is. And I --and we would  --we would retain our full panoply of arguments why the relator isn't entitled to a dime for that or for other reasons.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you, Ms. Ho.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So it seems to me that your ""provides"" argument rests on the premise that the FCA is about putting the public fisc at risk.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You've said this many times and that there is, you said, a historical link between the public fisc and the FCA. And I guess I'm looking at the history and I don't really see it that way, so I'd like for you to respond. You know, as I read the history of the FCA, the purpose is broader than just trying to protect the public fisc. In fact, when Congress passed in 1986 the amendments where ""claim"" -- the ""claim"" definition that we're talking about here was put into the statute, it also had a report that talked about what it was doing, and that GAO report documented widespread fraud in government programs and focused on ""the non-monetary effects"" of the fraud and Congress's concern that it wasn't just about the money. It talked about things like the loss of confidence in government programs. It pointed to incidents in which the beneficiaries of the program did not get the benefits that Congress wanted them to get. So it was clearly beyond the fiscal impact. And so what I guess I'm wondering is: Doesn't that sort of undermine your argument that all we need to care about here is looking at this through the lens of whether or not the government has actual monetary skin in the game in this way?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yeah. Respectfully, no, Justice Jackson, and  --and I think that's the case for three reasons. And let me start with this Court's precedents on the False Claims Act, and this Court has said again and again that the False Claims Act is not an all-purpose fraud statute, even fraud against the government. It is not an all-purpose fraud statute against the government. I think the reason for that is that at every juncture from the 1986 amendments to the 2009 amendments, Congress has made adjustments to the False Claims Act, but it has never --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah. No, I'm not talking  -- I --I -- I --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> --it has never severed the rule from that.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, I understand. But I guess what I'm trying to perhaps get your feedback on is if we  think that the False Claims Act was doing more than just caring about whether the government lost a dollar as a result of this fraud but, in fact, was also about whether the fraud  prevented the program from operating. The government has lots of different ways in which it might fund its programs. Some of them might be direct funding from the government. Some of them might be orders by the government to have other people fund the program. But, at the end of the day, what the government wants is for that program to operate effectively. It wants it to work. And fraud, says the  government in its reports when it put out the FCA, is undermining the effectiveness of our program. So you want us to make a distinction about whether or not the FCA applies that based on the -- that is based on the mechanism of funding, but that just assumes that the mechanism of funding mattered to the government. And I'm telling you that from the history, what -- the  --the government was broader than the mechanism of funding as the reason why the FCA should apply.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> And I think, Justice Jackson, the best  --our -- our -- our surest instrument for registering the concern and purpose of Congress is the text of the statute that it enacted. And --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, I understand. I understand. But you make --</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text>--and it referred  --and it referred to me --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- a lot of representations about what -- I'm only going this route because your whole argument is the  government wanted in the FCA to have this protection of the government funds.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So let me just ask you one final question. What -- what do you do with the fact that the House report from 1986 that discusses the statutory definition of ""claim"" says, ""A claim upon any government agency or instrumentality, quasi-governmental corporation, or non-appropriated fund activity is a claim against""  -- ""upon the United States under the Act.""  It seems very clear that Congress wanted to get at things beyond just actual government agencies in this way, that they were also sweeping in government corporations, et cetera, as necessary to make sure that its programs operated.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Yes, Justice Jackson. I -- 42 think the key word in all of the examples you just made is  --is ""government,"" right? Government agency, government --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So is this a quasi-govern  --I thought this was a quasi-governmental corporation, the USAC.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It's not?</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> No. The --the -- the  -- the Administrative Company --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text>--is a private company. It is a private corporation incorporated in -- in -- in Delaware, and  -- and -- and we -- we know that it's not a government instrumentality or agent because, if it were, it would run afoul of the Government Corporation Control Act because</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text>-- the FCC sought permission, and it wasn't provided.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Mr. Singh.</text>","<speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  When Wisconsin Bell requests E-rate funds, the government provides the money. The administrator pays on the government's behalf using money the government collects and controls  to advance a federal program that the government created.

So, when the administrator paid Wisconsin Bell, that was the government providing money through its agent. Indeed, many government programs, including most notably Medicare, use private claims administrators to provide billions of dollars to beneficiaries of government programs.

I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Mr. Singh, if this had been an appropriated fund and the administrator had been an federal agency, this would be, of course, a very straightforward case. We'd know exactly what the government's  financial stake was. But this is private money from private parties to another private party, and it's very difficult to see what the government's financial stake is. And I think it's  --it -- you might ultimately conclude, or we might, that it is enough to be federal funds. But it doesn't look like federal funds. It looks like private funds. So, in this -- in this instance, would you explain exactly what  the government's financial stake is here?  It hasn't appropriated any monies, it hasn't given any grants, and it hasn't lost anything. No matter what happens here, the government's not out of pocket.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Sure. So let me -- let me start with part of the premise I'm not sure I agree with. As Ms. Ho admitted in the first  part of the argument, this is treated for budget purposes as a permanent indefinite appropriation. The appropriation is located in  the Telecommunications Act, so it's not a year-to-year appropriation where a specific amount of money is designated, but it is treated for budget purposes as appropriated funds. And so, to the extent that that's significant, I think it's satisfied here. Such permanent indefinite appropriations are pretty commonplace throughout the federal budget, and so that piece of the premise I'm not sure I agree with. But I take the point that there are aspects in which the funding structure of this program is unusual, that there is less government touching the money than there might be for other federal programs. And, as I said in my introduction, I just don't think that that can be dispositive as to the question whether the federal government is providing the money. On the specific question of what has the government lost, I think, if you look at this the way that I do, which is to say the government could have ingested this money into Treasury accounts and then moved it to the administrator and out to beneficiaries -- in fact, we know it could have because it did so in  2018. It relocated all of the funds into Treasury accounts. Nothing changed about how  the program works. It is still the same -- quintessentially the exact same program except for the flows of funds. And so I would say what the government loses is all that money coming in because that is money that the government solely controls to achieve its governmental purposes. And so, when that money is not available because fraud depletes the Universal Service Fund, there is less money on hand to pay the beneficiaries that the government is trying to provide affordable telecommunications services to. And that is really no different, I think, from any other government spending program.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well  -- I'm sorry, why don't you finish your answer.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> No, I think that that's what I've got.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> It is a little bit different, and you mentioned this at the beginning. It  --the GAO calls this back  -- backdoor appropriations, which is not -- you know, that's a little bit of a pejorative term,  I mean, and the reason I think is because you do get a very large amount of money without going through the normal appropriations process. And it seems to me that that's a significant question, maybe at too high a level of generality, but if you can take and spend for whatever purposes you would like any amount of money so long as you require a -- a -- a private entity to pay it into a fund and then you exercise whatever authority you want to dis pose of it in a particular way, that seems to me a significant exception to the normal appropriations process, and I wonder if that's a concern at all.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> I don't think it's a concern in this instance. Nobody has made the argument that anytime you have a permanent indefinite appropriation, the False Claims Act just doesn't apply or the program is invalid. There is a  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well  --</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> As the Court may be aware, there are other cases pending about the validity  of the Universal Service Fund structure, precisely under doctrines like non-delegation, that go to some of the concerns you're raising. But I don't think those are False Claims Act concerns. What the False Claims Act is concerned with  is protecting the integrity of government programs, as Justice Jackson pointed out, and ensuring that program funds move to their intended beneficiaries, which are identified by the government, and the amounts they're supposed to get come from the government as well. And so I think, if you have concerns about how the program is structured, those are really concerns for another case, not this one, because they don't bear on whether the Universal Service Administrative Company is an agent of the United States, nor whether the funds are provided by the government. And I would just say one more thing which may help with the concern you're drawing, is that the Universal Service Administrative Company, the administrator here, is not like just any private entity. You know, it's not as if private carriers are being ordered to pay funds to just another private company that's out there. This company has one job. Its only job is to administer this government progra m or this set of Universal Service government programs. It has no real other function, and I think that really does distinguish this situation from things the other side  talks about, like minimum wage or potentially other examples where the government is causing money to move between private parties and we don't normally think of it as providing money.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> If  -- if we're persuaded by your argument on the hundred million dollars, it seems to me a difficult question whether or not that sort of -- whatever a non-pejorative word for ""taints"" is, in other words, whether that determines the characteristic of the other umpteen billion dollars. I mean, if  --if it were 10 million, would that be enough to characterize the entire rest of the fund, or $1?  Or are you limited with respect to, whether it's damages or whatever, to the percent of money that you actually collect?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> The text of the statute says that if the government provides any portion of the money requested or demanded, then it's covered. Now, as I say, I think the government provides it all. Wisconsin Bell can't get a  penny that the government does not authorize it to get. And so that's our frontline argument,  of course.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> So  -- so just to stop there --</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> -- your frontline argument is, if it's a dollar, the entire billion -dollar account is government funds?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Well  -- well, to be clear, our frontline argument is all of the money is government funds. Now  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> -- coming down to your question, which is about what if only a subset of the money is provided by the government, I think that under the ""any portion"" language, all of the claims are still false claims. I do acknowledge that there will be damages questions down the line, and to be candid, that is part of why we're saying all of the money is government money. We don't want to talk about those questions down the line. We want it to be clear because this litigation has been pending for a very long time, and we think resolving it expeditiously is to everyb ody's benefit. So part of the reason we're arguing for all of the money is looking around the corner at the damages questions. But, to be clear, in this case, the Petitioner has not made an argument. They have not even attempted to make the tracing argument that Justice Gorsuch was alluding to. They could have said:  Well, if it's only the hundred million, then that's not enough to make us liable. They have said nothing of the sort. And so I don't think that question is before you. I think you can acknowledge, as both parties have, that the ""any portion"" language basically gets us home on liability if you're inclined to go that way, but I really do want to talk through all of the money.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Mr. Singh, on  --on the hundred million, just to wrap that up, so there is no traceability argument, so that takes us to the question of damages. Would a ruling on the hundred million point in your favor cause you any heartburn when  it comes to damages and, if so, what would it be?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yes. Well, Your Honor, I think it will cause the government more heartburn than it causes me specifically, but it will cause a lot of heartburn. Here's why. The hundred million -- if  -- if a hundred million were treated as the upper limit on damages and --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Would it be, or -- or would that be relevant at all under the damages provision?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> The issue has not been briefed in this case or argued. The law of damages is --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I suspect you've done a lot of thinking about that.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> I have done a bit. This Court's precedents are quite favorable to us in saying that the amount  of damages should be liberally construed to make the government completely whole  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> -- and words to that effect.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So you'd take the position that the hundred million is not the upper limit?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> We certainly would. But it's  --I -- I acknowledge that it would be a fight over the -- a legal fight over this that's unnecessary, I think.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. Okay. And I got that.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So your  -- is your first preference then it provides all the money?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Certainly.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. And if we rule on that ground, there's no need to get into the agency stuff either, I would think.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Sure.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And  --and, there, there's some complications too because Congress added the word ""agent"" in 2009, and  some of your claims predate that, right?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yeah. Let me refund that a moment. So I do think you're right that presenting a claim to an agent, whether the government provided the money or not, that's actionable only after the 2009 amendments.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right. Okay.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> But I actually think that if you agree with us on the substance of the agency point that the Administrative Company is the government's agent, it sheds a lot of light on who's providing the money.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I -- I -- I get that. But  -- but --but your frontline argument is it provides all. And that would be your preference because  -- over the hundred million, for the obvious reasons we've discussed, it would be your preference over the agency line of reasoning because of 2009?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> But I don't want this to sound just like my naked litigation preference as it is also my --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> No, I -- I -- I want to know your naked litigation preferences. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> And you have them.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> You have them.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That's all I need to know. Thank you.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So, Mr. --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> What you've got on the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You were just cut off.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Oh, yeah. So  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, I  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Well, no.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> -- so it's not only what I want. It's also really about what this statute is meant to accomplish. You know, I think there is a point in which I  --I somewhat agree with the other side, which is  when Ms. Ho says that the -- the hundred million is really not terribly different from all of the contributions, there's a sense in which I agree with that because, although that money is the money that the government collects, banks, and then transfers, and so you have to just ignore what you see with your own eyes to ignore that the government is providing that money, all of the money is dedicated to the same purpose. It's all moving for the same reason.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> That  -- that's a huge difference, I think, in practice. I mean, all taxes come into a government account and then go out. And with the hundred million, you can really analogize to how the -- almost the entire federal appropriations process works, right?  So that's why the word ""provides"" there -- I think the other side has a little bit of trouble on the hundred million, but then, when you get to the rest of it, it seems like you have a -- a bit of a problem because the word ""provides"" does not to me at least ordinarily fit when the government orders one private party to provide money to another private party, which is, when we get outside the hundred million, what I think is going on here. But correct me if I'm wrong or respond otherwise.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yeah, let me chew on this a little bit with you. So I think the -- when you think about the providing of money, I think  that there are two ways you can think about it at least. One is, who is providing money to the Universal Service Fund, right?  We say the government provides it because it created  the fund and mandates the money go into it. They say the carriers provided it. Okay. And I get that there's a debate, and as you acknowledge, we can fight over that. But you can think about it slightly differently. The statute doesn't say, you know, who provides money to the fund. It says:  Who provides the money requested or demanded?  And so you also, I think, should ask the question: Who is providing the money to Wisconsin Bell and claimants like Wisconsin Bell?  And when you think about it that way, there is no plausible argument, I think, that the carriers are providing that money. They have relinquished all control of the funds by  the time it gets to the Universal Service Fund. At that point, your only choices are: It's either the administrator or it's the government, right?  And the administrator  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, is the administrator a government --</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> --is only doing what --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- is the administrator a government official?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> No, but it is  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> No, and that's  --</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> -- an agent.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- that  --that's critical here, right?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Well  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> That's  -- on the -- again, on the bigger argument, that's critical?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> -- no, because, for the reasons that Justice Kagan gave with her soup hypothetical and Justice Barrett with her proctor hypothetical, when you have someone who's just acting as an agent, we normally attribute the providing of the thing to the principal. And, in fact, this is an example the other side uses in their brief. They say, when Grandma sends $20 through the post office, we  credit Grandma, not the post office. In this situation, if you ask who's providing the money to Wisconsin Bell, well, the administrator is transferring the money, but  it's doing so because the government requires it to. It can't transfer a dollar more or a dollar less.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> But, Mr. Singh, just to give an example maybe in aid of Justice Kavanaugh's line of thinking  --we've had some colorful ones. This is less colorful, I admit -- but  a court order ordering a judgment, plaintiff, you get money from defendant. Does the court provide that money or does the defendant provide that money and in -- if  -- if  so, what makes that example different?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yeah. So I don't think we would say in ordinary usage that the court provides that money. I want to make two points kind of clear. First, I think that we read the word ""provides"" in context, right, and so th e whole context is the government provides any portion  of the money or property requested or demanded, and then there's that stuff about government programs, government interests. And I think, when you look at it in context, what we're asking is:  Here, did the government fund this government program or not?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Well --</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> And I think it did.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- court orders have certainly funded the plaintiff's coffers very nicely, and  --</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yes, but it's not a government program.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and it did through government coercion in the same way that we have here, right?  It's  -- it's, you know, on pains of going to jail if you don't do it. So what  --what's the difference?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> So I think what the difference is if you look at just exactly what I was talking to Justice Kavanaugh about. In that situation, certainly, the defendant who has to pay the plaintiff is not the government's agent, right?  And so you normally  -- as I was saying, when a principal says, agent, give the money to someone, you attribute the giving to the principal.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Putting aside the agency argument --</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> I like the agency argument. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I know you do.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Do you have anything beyond the agency argument?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> That is my --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> -- that is the clearest, most crystallized response, but I think more broadly --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, isn't the  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Mr. Singh  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- entire civil litigation system  -- under what you're describing as government program, the entire civil litigation system is a ""government program""?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> So, in context, I don't think that's true, Your Honor. I -- I don't think the government has been construed to mean  the court system under the False Claims Act. That's kind of a separate question. I would also add --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> But just on your theory of ""provides""  --</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yeah. I would also add, though --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Wait. Can you stop there?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yeah, yeah. Sorry.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> On your theory of ""provides,"" why wouldn't it be?  Put aside, you know, the government hasn't contended or  --</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> So, under our theory of ""provides,"" as I'm saying, the -- the court system in that --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Which you've connected to the word ""program"" as opposed to ""fisc.""  That's a key move in your argument, I think, government program rather than government fisc. The word ""provides"" goes to government program. Under your theory of that, why isn't the civil litigation system a government program that  --in which the government is providing the money, in Justice Gorsuch's example, to the plaintiff?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yeah. So, as I was saying, I don't think the word ""government,""  with a capital G in the statute, has been construed to mean the court system. I would also say that, like, to the extent you're concerned about this  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> That doesn't answer my question, but you can keep going.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Isn't the answer, Mr. Singh, about the duties that are running in the civil litigation?  In other words, the duties, the duty to pay comes from the defendant, the private person, right  --</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- based on the -- the claim that the plaintiff has. It's not -- the duty is not coming from the court in the same way.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Well, that's right. I mean, the court will enforce the duty or  -- yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> The court is just enforcing --</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- in that situation. That's why the court is not --</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> And that also is, I think, my point about how, when a principal orders an agent to pay, that's different from regulating, where -- when the government  --it's not -- you do not have to accept the proposition and we do not want you to accept the proposition that anytime the government causes money to flow from A to B, it has provided money within the meaning of the False Claims Act. We think that this statute is limited to the situation where the government is funding its programs. It's not going to encompass all regulation. And I would say that to the extent you have any concerns about this, empirically, the fact that there aren't cases all the time where every plaintiff who's recovered in civil litigation is bringing False Claims Act cases because someone defrauded them is good evidence that the statute --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, until we rule  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> If I  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- for you here. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And then we might. I mean, that's --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Mr. Singh  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- the concern. Sorry to interrupt.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> No, no, I interrupted you. Go ahead.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I'm done.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> You're done? What  -- regardless of -- let -- let's assume you win, and regardless of whether you win on the hundred million argument or your larger argument, what are the damages sustained?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> In our view, the damages sustained are all of the money that went into the E-rate program because the government has caused that money to be available for the beneficiaries, and so, when Wisconsin Bell take s it unlawfully, they have made a false claim for money.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So it's not just the money that Wisconsin Bell took unlawfully?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> So there will be a debate about whether the entire amount claimed --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Assuming that it took it unlawfully, of course.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yeah, yeah.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> There will be a debate about that between  the parties. We think that the right way to make the government whole is to take the entire claim amount. They may argue that it's the delta. So if, you know, they violate the  lowest-corresponding price rule by charging  --sorry. Can I finish, Your Honor?</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Sure.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yeah. If they violate it by charging  50 percent more than they should have, then there is some delta of overcharge, which results in a delta of subsidy, and maybe they'll argue that that amount is the damages. That has not been hashed out yet in the lower courts. Our position will be -- you can guess, our po sition will be the broader damages position. Their position will be the narrowest one. And that will be something to be figured out on remand.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Just a matter of curiosity. What would be the difference between  the authorities of the agent as opposed to a case if  -- where there was a sub-agency that administered the fund?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> I'm sorry. I want to make sure that I'm --</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Normally, you would have an agency in the government administering a government program.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> The  -- here, you're saying that the private entity is an agent. So what is the difference in their authority and their liability and  -- and their conduct in -- in this E-rate program?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> So, if I hear the question correctly, and please correct me if I don't, the idea is how is it different -- how can USAC, the Administrative Company, be held accountable differently from if a government sub-agency were administering the program?</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> That's close enough.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Okay. So the way that USAC's appointment works, they have a memorandum of understanding with the government. They are appointed to be the permanent administrator by  virtue of FCC regulations. They receive  -- they have regular oversight meetings with the FCC. They get letters and phone calls telling them what to do. And, of course, they have a bunch of regulations telling them what to do as well and the memoranda of understanding. If they breach the terms of that, the FCC can correct them. If they refuse to be corrected, the sanctions can go as high as them losing their job, which would be kind of similar, I think, to what would happen to federal employees. And I think, overall, that's a really strong point in our favor because, if this entire function could be in-housed and look essentially the same, I think that tells you that they are acting as government agents.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> The difference is that the program, that the administrator here has no liability or no relationship with the -- with Congress, for example, and it's not treated as a government agency and is not subject to the government rules. It's just, you're saying, a memorandum of understanding. It's just an agreement.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Well, I think, if Congress wanted to say don't use this entity, it could say that. I think, if Congress  --if the FCC wanted to terminate the relationship, it can do so. And so I think that there may be slightly greater freedom in the current structure because maybe the FCC couldn't get rid of a sub -agency. It would depend how it was created. But I think it's very, very similar. I  -- I -- I don't see a lot of practical differences between how this program actually works and how it would work if it were entirely housed within the government. I think it was put outside just to be efficient, and I don't think government should be punished for shying away from big government and doing the more efficient thing.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Well, for those of us who have run agencies, it would be a lot easier to control the -- an agent under an MOU than to have to deal with an agency that is also subject to oversight.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Your Honor, that may be true. I don't know. In this case, I think what we understand is that the control structure  allows the FCC with fairly comprehensive control over the administrator's actions, which is one reason why we think it's an agent.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Let me see if I correctly understand some of what you have just told us. The question here  -- the only question before us is whether the reimbursement requests are claims under the False Claims Act. You could win on any of three grounds. The narrowest of those would concern the 100 million. But you've argued that we should really decide the case under one of the other broader grounds because that might have an effect on a damages question that has not been briefed and we don't know whether the case will ever get to the issue of damages. Is that a correct summary of some of what you've said?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> That is part of why I want to do it, but, as I pointed out, I think that there is a legal doctrinal reason to decide the case on slightly broader grounds. One of the reasons  --so it's true, if you say that we win on the hundred million, you will resolve the technical circuit split over the question presented, which is whether E-rate funds are covered by the False Claims Act. But there is a little bit of disuniformity in the legal rules that courts have used to get there. The Fifth Circuit said the money has to come from the Treasury. The Seventh Circuit said no. And so there would be a little bit of disuniformity still remaining. I think it's worthwhile, if easy, to resolve that by reaching the broader ground that the government provided all the money. And I think it will also provide more clarity for other cases that aren't just about the E-rate program if folks understand that when the government funds its programs, even if it does so through this direct efficient mechanism instead of an inefficient mechanism, the False  Claims Act still applies. So, yes, I  --I do think you can resolve it on the narrowest ground. I don't know that that's the most satisfactory resolution.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, what if you were to  -- what if we thought that you should win under the hundred million argument but lose  under the other two?  Then I assume you wou ld prefer to just take your narrow victory and go home, right?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Oh, sure. Then you should say the hundred million, we decide nothing else. And I'll work with the courts on remand. No problem. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thanks a lot.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That was quite fascinating. I'm still laughing over it, counsel. I -- I do want to go back to these two theories. I -- I actually thought there were three theories that you had proposed. The first  was that the entire program is a government program. The government is supplying the money because the government's setting the rate at which the contractors have to pay. They're telling the Universal Service Fund how to spend  that money. And they're creating the FCC program that qualifies carriers to receive the money. So they're controlling every aspect of  the distribution, correct?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yes. That's our argument for sure.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I think they're doing this more specifically than many of the appropriations mechanisms that we reviewed recently  --I think one of my colleagues wrote about this -- in which we have appropriations to agencies with no more guidance than says it's a continuing X amount and you spend it on these things and that's it. We have more specificity than that here, correct?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Quite correct. The FCC's rules are very detailed.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Okay. And we have some appropriations that  --that are based on how much is collected by the -- that agency, and they're entitled to spend that, and if they don't spend that, they can save it for the future, correct?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yeah. And this is one such program, yes.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And that's your point, that this is very similar to those appropriation programs?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yes. Our point, Your Honor, is that the E-rate program and the Universal Service programs are fundamentally no different from basically every government spending program.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right. I missed an answer you were giving, I think, to Justice Barrett when she was asking you about the measure of damages. I -- I thought that your claim was that under this program, they should have paid us  -- or they should have not charged us a certain amount; they should have charged us a lot less. But you seemed to be suggesting in your answer to Justice Barrett that your claim is something more than the amount that you were charged.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yeah. So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Am I understanding your answer to her?  And if that's true, what's that something more?  What has the U.S. lost besides the fact that you should have been paid  -- that you should have paid less money, I guess?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yeah. So I think that if the outcome of the damages analysis is that the -- you know, only the extra amount of subsidy that was given to Wisconsin Bell and its customers is the measure of damages, that would be a reasonable outcome to the damages discussion. But all I was telling Justice Barrett is, you know, that has not been hashed out yet. We're not at the damages stage. And so  -- yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I understand that. I'm going back to, what else are you claiming you're entitled to besides that?  That's the part that I  don't understand.</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> So, in certain contexts, when claims are made that should not have been paid, courts have determined that the entire amount claimed constitutes damages. This may not be such a case. The other side may win, that, no, we were allowed to  make a claim, you just think we made it too big, and so the damages are less. My point is only that because that discussion hasn't yet happened, I don't want to prejudice what my colleagues may talk about on remand. I just wanted to give you the gamut of the arguments that may be presented. But, certainly, one of the arguments that I think could carry the day in this case down the line is that what we're talking -- the loss is the delta between what was paid and what should have been paid.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You still haven't answered my question. What is the amount of the claim, the total claim, that's your alternative argument?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> So it would be the amount of each subsidy claim made in whole, and so --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Even though they paid a part of it?  So, if you asked for a $50,000 subsidy and they only gave you 20,  you're still entitled to the 50, or are you claiming something more?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Right. So the question for damages would be, should this claim have been paid at all?  And if the answer is no, then the entire amount of the claim is going to be damages. If the answer is yes, it should have been paid but for a lesser amount, then the amount of damages is going to be the delta. And so my only point is that  that debate has not yet happened, but that's what's teed up.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan?</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Could I go back to the conversation you were having with Justice Gorsuch when he gave you the other example and you said to him, no, that would not be a -- a normal use of the word ""provide"" and you said it's all a matter of context. And then you said the context here is that the administrator is acting as an agent. And is -- if we don't feel like getting into the question of exactly whether the administrator is an agent, the sort of back 10 pages of  everybody's briefs where we have to figure out, you know, does an agent have to have the power to bind the government or all that, if we just take that off the table and  --and said:  Okay, now we want a different kind of rule that separates the case in front of us from the case  that Justice Gorsuch raised, do you have another rule for that?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Yeah. So I think that when I say context, the context of the statutory text is the government provides any portion of the money or property requested or demanded in the context, of course, of government programs. And so I think, when you try to distinguish  -- this was the conversation that was also happening, I think, with Justices Jackson and Kavanaugh about how do you distinguish mere regulation from things that are going to be covered by the False Claims Act. And I think that what you look to is the  -- the sort of core of it, is the government funding one of its spending program here?  And if it is, then we think context suggests that when the government is the one causing the money to move into and out of the program, it's providing. And we think that that's quite different from a lot of the situations you can  imagine where the government might cause money to move but is not running a government program. And I think one thing that is interesting about the word ""provide,"" it is an extraordinarily flexible word. There are all sorts of situations where I could say to you, you know, give you a hypothetical and you would say:  Oh, yeah, that sounds like someone's providing it. And I give you a slightly different hypothetical and you say:  Well, tha t doesn't really sound like someone else is providing it. And both our brief and the government's brief have focused on what -- and so what you do is you interpret it in context. And both our brief and the government's brief have focused on the fact that this is the context of a government spending program that Congress created, that the FCC administers tip to tail, and where all of the rules, both for how money comes out, how it has to be housed  --comes in, is housed, and then goes out are all set by the government. It's the only one making any decisions. And so I think that's how you would distinguish it even if you didn't want to talk about the vagaries of agency law under the Restatement and all that.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Gorsuch?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Mr. Singh, on  --on -- on your -- on -- on the 150 -- or the hundred million dollar option, the other side hasn't argued traceability, so that's good for you. And then the question comes to damages and whether there might be some upper limit based on the hundred million. Are you going to come anywhere near that under either theory of damages you've laid out here?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> In this case, possibly not, but the issue would be that --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. So that could be resolved in a future case. The larger ""provides"" question could be resolved in a future case without doing damage to this one?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> If you leave it open, absolutely, yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?  Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Let me just ask one quick question. The hundred million dollars, it  seems to me, is premised on the notion that that's the government's only stake in this, that -- that -- that you have to have skin in the game as the government. Here, they have a hundred million dollars in it, so that is really why the FCA cares about this. And I guess I just am struggling with that in light of my view based on the history and the broader statute that the FCA was the government's concern about the integrity of its program, that it was trying to fund a program and have it operate and, yes, it put money into it, but it's not just the money that's at stake. Do you have a reaction to that?</text><speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Sure. I share your view that the concerns animating the False Claims Act are broader than financial loss. I think the text of the statute in multiple p laces makes that very clear when it talks about whether or  not the government has title to the money, when it includes any claim presented to an employee, officer, or agent, whether or not the government has provided the money. Even the remedial provision, which Ms. Ho says is a point in their favor, is, I think, a strong point in our favor because you actually still have civil monetary penalties even if the government sustains no damages. I think this case provides a useful illustration of the point you're raising. As we explained in our statement of the case, it's not only the federal government that suffered here, it's also schools and libraries. School s and libraries were overcharged in the first instance. The federal government suffers the brunt of the financial harm because it subsidizes that overcharging, but the schools and libraries also suffer in other contexts. Think about Medicare. Think of all the programs that the False Claims Act defends. It's not just the government's pocketbook. It's the health of beneficiaries, senior citizens. It's defense programs and our abi lity to field a fighting force that can survive out there. There are all kinds of interests that the False Claims Act protects that have nothing to do with money, and that is why the statute does not require proof of financial loss. And,  as you say, it's made quite clear in the legislative history as well.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G.

7,2024.22-7466-t01,"<speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Richard Glossip was convicted on the word of one man, Justin Sneed, the undisputed murderer in this case. Oklahoma has now disclosed evidence revealing that Mr. Sneed lied to the jury about his history of psychiatric treatment, including the fact that a prison psychiatrist prescribed lithium to treat his previously undiagnosed bipolar disorder. The prosecution suppressed that evidence and then failed to correct Mr. Sneed's perjured denial, just as it suppressed evidence that in the middle of trial, in violation of the court's sequestration order, Sneed altered his testimony about the knife wounds on the victim at the urgent request of the prosecutor, who then falsely denied to the court her prior knowledge. There is no adequate or independent jurisdictional bar to review and no warrant for an evidentiary hearing. As to independence, the court's opinion is suffused with merits determinations on the Brady and Napue claims. And, certainly, there is no ""clear and express statement"" that the court's decision is based on a bona fide separate, adequate, and independent grounds, as long required by this Court to preclude review. Nor is there any adequate bar. By rejecting the State's waiver, the court created a jurisdictional threshold it had never applied in any other case. The disposition was ""without support in prior state law,"" as required by over 60 years of this Court's precedent to establish adequacy. No evidentiary hearing could alter the conclusion that Mr. Glossip was denied due process. There's no dispute that, contrary to Sneed's sworn testimony, the State's own suppressed record shows that he was, in fact, treated by a psychiatrist for bipolar disorder, just as there is no dispute that Sneed changed his testimony about the knife at the  urgent mid-trial request of the prosecutor, who then falsely denied that very fact to the court.

This Court should reverse and remand for a new trial. I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Mr. Waxman, you place quite a bit of weight on the note, notes, from Smothermon and Ackley, and from your opening statement, you clearly do not agree with them. Did you at any point get a statement from either one of the prosecutors?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Did you interview them?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Well, to be clear, we  -- we did get a sworn statement, which I believe is at page 960 of the Joint Appendix, from Gary Ackley in which, for  --among other things, he never mentions the fact that  --he never mentions the account that he has now provided to the  -- in the amicus brief for the Van Treese family. And, as to Ms. Smothermon, Ms. Smothermon was interviewed both by the independent  --the legislature's independent counsel and by the attorney general's independent counsel, Mr. Duncan. She gave different answers each time,  none of which was the account she's now provided in an unsworn letter attached to the Van Treese brief.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Well, it would seem that because not only, you know, their reputations are being impugned, but they are  central to this case, it would seem that they  -- an interview of these two prosecutors would be central. They suggest that the  --their interviews were generally about prosecuting capital cases and not specifically about the details of this.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Well, their current unsworn statement appended at the very last minute for the very first time in a merits amicus brief before this Court deserves all the benefit of the doubt that they -- you know, to which they're entitled. When -- in the context of -- Mr. Ackley did file an affidavit. It is in the record in this case. And it is not in any way consistent with his current account. As to  --</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Did they make themselves unavailable?  Sorry to interrupt you.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Well, he  --he made himself available. He provided us a declaration.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> No, it's  -- what you're saying is -- would make sense if, for  some reason, they had made themselves unavailable. They suggest that they were not sought out and given an opportunity to give detailed accounts of what those notes meant and -- and what they did during the trial.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Justice Thomas, with respect, there is a reason why both independent counsels and the attorney general of the state credited the account of what those notes show, and the  -- and their own words, her own words on the notes can't be disputed. And the reason that they gave for that explanation amounts to the fact that, in context, this is a prosecutor who, one, destroyed and disbursed material evidence both before and during the appeal of this case and during post-conviction proceedings; two, she falsely told the court that it had complied with its obligation to provide the substance of all statements by Justin Sneed; number three, they belittled the formal discovery request for mental health records as a ""fishing expedition"" and said that no such records existed. She -- this is a prosecutor who engineered a mid -trial change in Justin Sneed's testimony and then denied doing so in the court  and stood silent in the face of the testimony -- the false testimony that she elicited about psychiatric treatment. And I think  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Mr. Waxman, the counsel appointed by the Court argues that a central element of your case is the jury -- that the jury would have regarded the matter differently if they knew that the lithium had been prescribed by a psychiatrist as opposed to someone else because the jury knew about the lithium and what they didn't know is that it was prescribed by a psychiatrist. Do you -- do you really think it would make that much of a difference to the jury?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Well, I think that's not the only material difference here, that the -- the  -- the fact was not only that he was -- it was that he lied and was allowed to lie when he said that he never saw a psychiatrist, which the defense  -- which -- you know, it is one thing for a witness to stand up in court and testify  on the basis of a promise of leniency by the prosecution. It's one thing for a witness to speculate or be inaccurate about what actually happened. What the jury is told, this is a  witness who lied about the fact that he had seen psychiatric testimony and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. And this is a witness who, at the mid-trial inducement of the prosecutor, changed his testimony about whether, in fact, he had also stabbed the victim. It very well could have made a significant difference in the outcome of the case. Just  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Mr. Waxman, the issue wasn't about him taking lithium. The issue was about why he was taking the lithium.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Yes, of course.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And so the fact that the jury knew he had taken lithium during incarceration doesn't tell them anything about whether he had bipolar -- a bipolar condition, that his use of drugs would have led to impulsive and violent behavior, correct?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> That's correct. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And would have explained the murder, correct?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> I'm sorry?  And would have explained the murder.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And would have explained the murder. Now can I go back to the two questions here?  I have three of my own, okay?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> There's a lot -- and you spent a whole lot of time in your introduction, a lot of spilt in here on whether the PCPA is an adequate and independent state ground. I'm not even sure why we're doing all that when -- you're right, the court below seemed to confuse the merits with the procedural bar, but it's very clear that a procedural bar is always waiveable under Oklahoma law. Legions of cases say that, correct?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> And under federal law.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- so, once you waived, the only issue before the court was the substantive issue of whether there was a violation of federal law, correct?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's really the only issue before us, the procedural bar. A  lot of spilt in, goes on and on about, is this the first time they didn't waive it?  Is it not the first time they didn't waive it?  The reason that's true is because they accept the waiver when there's a violation of a right, and they don't accept the waiver when there's no violation of a right. Here, they found no violation of a right, so they reached the substantive legal issue and said:  We're not going to waive. You don't find any case in Oklahoma law  --and your adversary, Mr. Waxman, can tell me -- where they found a constitutional violation either under state or federal law and said:  We won't accept a PCPA waiver. Can't find it because it doesn't exist. So now we're on the federal issue, okay?  That's all I'm looking at. Was there a Napue?  Was there a Brady violation?  That's your argument, correct?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Now, on the Van Treese issue, that's non-record evidence, so it's not before us.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> It's not only not before you, it wasn't the basis on -- it wasn't before the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So whatever that was.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> It was never even suggested then.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Now we know we had two independent counsels. At least one of them, if not both, talked to Gary Ackley because --</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- he submitted an affidavit.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And he said in that affidavit that Justin Sneed was on lithium as treatment for bipolar disorder would have been an important fact for the defense to know.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So he concedes the basis of the Napue order  --violation here, didn't he?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Certainly the Brady violation.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Right. Now, if he's changed his testimony now in unsworn materials, that's irrelevant to us here, and it's irrelevant to the finding the Oklahoma court made below, correct?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> That's right.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right. So now let's go to the substance of the issue that the Chief raised, which was:  Could he have found this earlier and does that make a difference to the Napue violation and the Brady violation?  I thought the essence of the Napue violation is:  Was there a falsehood?  Did the prosecutor know it was a falsehood?  Not whether the defendant knew it was a falsehood but whether the prosecutor has an obligation to correct it. Is that correct?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> It is correct that both Napue and its subsequent cases and Brady and its progeny both look to the -- the obligation, the constitutional obligation of the prosecutor, and  not what the defense could have discovered.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right. Now let's go to  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. We'll -- we'll get back shortly through the se riatim questions. Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> You don't have a question?</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Sorry. All right. Well, Mr. Waxman, Justice Sotomayor has taken us through the whole case, so maybe there's not much left to discuss, but I did have a few questions. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals said in paragraph 24 of its opinion, ""Even if this claim overcomes procedural bar, the facts do not rise to the level of a Brady violation."" Why isn't that a quintessential clear statement under -- under Long?  Even if it does not overcome the procedural bar, then  --and it goes on, then to the federal issue?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Well, I  -- I think --I think that the sentence you just read me is susceptible to at least two interpretations. One is the one you're implying, and the other is that they have just finished dispensing with a number of other claims in their opinion,  all of which they very clearly unequivocally barred on state procedural default grounds. When they come to the Brady claim, the court says:  Even if this claim overcomes procedural bar, I will then now spend the next four paragraphs -- well, three of the next four paragraphs discussing the merits of the Brady claim. And, at a minimum, Justice Alito, I think we have to acknowledge that paragraphs 24 through 28 -- and this is repeated again at paragraph 41 and paragraph 12 -- that the -- any statements by the court with respect to the state procedural bar are, to quote this Court's precedents, ""interwoven with and influenced by its consideration of the federal constitutional claims.""</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Why -- why is that so? In paragraph 26, the -- the Oklahoma court goes through the two requirements under state law under 1089. The issue is one that could have been presented previously because the factual basis for the claim was ascertainable  through the exercise of reasonable diligence. And then it goes on to the  --to the innocence requirement. And the facts are not sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for the alleged error, no  reasonable fact finder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense or would have rendered the penalty of death.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> I -- I don't deny --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> What's ambiguous about that?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Justice Alito, there is no denying that the entirety of paragraph 26 is a near -verbatim recitation of the two prongs of the state procedural bar. There is also no denying that it is preceded by two paragraphs discussing the merits of the Brady claim and succeeded by a paragraph which also goes in  --which goes in detail in explaining why the Brady claim fails.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> But what does that show?  Yes, there's no dispute that they -- they held in the alternative that there was no federal constitutional violation, but there is the Oklahoma statute. It has two requirements. They -- they -- they go through the two requirements, and they say that they weren't satisfied, and -- and they say:  Even if it could overcome the procedural bar, it still would not provide a basis for -- for relief. I -- I don't see what's unclear or even ambiguous about that.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Justice Alito, with respect, let me make two points. Number one -- I guess maybe two-and-a-half points. Number one, when the court deals with the Napue claim, which it does not address until paragraph 28, it never mentions procedural bar whatsoever. It is fully adjudicated on the merits. Number two, the -- I think that -- I think that one has to concede that, at a minimum, a minimum, with respect to the Brady claim, there is -- it is certainly interwoven with  --and it's physically on the page -- interwoven with what may or may not have been an adjudication of the state procedural bar. Certainly, it was influenced by it. And this Court, 41 years ago in Long versus Michigan and reiterated 30 years ago also in another opinion by Justice O'Connor, reiterated that -- and I'm quoting -- ""After  Long, a state court that wishes to look to federal law for guidance as an alternative holding while still relying on adequate and independent state grounds can avoid the presumption of federal jurisdiction by stating clearly and expressly that its decision is based on bona fide separate, adequate, and independent grounds.""</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Going on to another point, you rely very heavily on a note that says ""Lithium?  Dr. Trumpet?"". And you read a lot into that. And the Van Treese family's amicus brief provides a pretty compelling counter-reading of that. And -- and you want us to say, well, just pretend it doesn't exist and read those notes the way we think they should be read, those cryptic notes the way we think they should be read, because it's not the  -- the material that the Van Treese brief relies on is not in the record of the case. We shouldn't even remand for an exploration of this?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> As to the -- I'll deal with the remand first and then the weight that  ought to be given to the Van Treese brief's eleventh-and-a-half-hour explanation of these notes. There is the -- this case comes to you based on a holding of the Oklahoma Court of Appeals that did not have that account in front of it because the Van Treese family did not present it to the court and was predicated on a series of factual allegations and interpretations that were presented both by the prosecutor, the attorney general, and by Mr. Glossip, and fully supported in great detail and with reasoning by the two independent investigators, the  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. I  -- I --</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> -- investigations that had been done, and  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> -- I get your point. Your point is we shouldn't consider it because it's not in the record, right?  That's the short answer?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> I think that you shouldn't consider it for a whole lot of reasons, one of which is that it is inconsistent  -- it not only was never mentioned at a time when, surely, if it was the case, it would have been, and is inconsistent with what Mr. Ackley  says in his declaration. But let me  --let me just say this, Justice Alito. Even assuming that this account is true, there's no denying the fact -- and it's also in the record  -- that on --while his first conviction was on appeal, he was visited in prison by Mr. Glossip's defense lawyer and an investigator. And that is clearly reflected in the notes of both Ms. Smothermon and Mr. Ackley. There are a lot of other things that are accounted for in those notes that have nothing to do with that interview.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Let me just  --</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> But even if  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Let me -- let me go on to one other question because the time is limited. You read McCarty, a 2005 case where the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals accepted  the State's waiver of 1089, you rely on that, but there is no reasoning in McCarty. The court  simply said that in a footnote the State expressly waived any procedural bar. Do you -- do you read this for the proposition that the Oklahoma court must accept all 1089 waivers in future cases?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> I do. But even if I were wrong about that and it reflected the fact that it was a discretionary rule, it is clear from this Court's cases, Beard versus Kindler and Walker versus Martin, that a discretionary rule is inadequate unless applied consistent with an intelligible principle that is ""firmly established and regularly followed.""  And going all the way back to the 1960s --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> So one departure in the application of a discretionary  -- if the -- in a discretionary rule, if the rule is applied in a discretion -- in -- in a -- in -- in a habeas petitioner-friendly way in one case, that's the end of the matter?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Well, I  -- I think that there -- that there is a non-discretionary rule that is the rule of party presentation that Oklahoma has followed for a hundred years and McCarty is entirely consistent with that. But even if it were simply an instance of some discretion, again, this Court said in -- you know, 60 or 70 years ago and has reiterated since that a declination  --a state  -- the invocation of a state procedural rule ""without support in prior state law"" is inadequate. And in Johnson versus Mississippi, this Court said, ""A state procedural rule is not adequate unless strictly or regularly followed.""</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Thank you.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counselor, no matter how we get past this, we have to reach whether the court ruled correctly on the constitutional issue, correct?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Well, I  -- I --I think so based on my -- my position and the State's position that there is no jurisdictional bar.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And everything that the Oklahoma courts have done, you said a hundred years of their history, party presentation, the fact that they've never had a case with a constitutional violation where they didn't accept the waiver, correct?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> That's right.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And --</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> In fact, in this Court's -- in -- in the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals' jurisprudence, there is a case -- it's cited by everybody, Valdez versus the State  -- which says that the power to grant post --- relief post-conviction when an error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice or constitutes a substantive violation of a constitutional or statutory right. So this is not a rule that the court is ""powerless"" to grant a waiver or that it does not, in fact, routinely defer to party presentation.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So I go back to the  -- this is not AEDPA, correct?  Our review is not AEDPA?  Meaning --</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Did you say  -- --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It's not AEDPA review.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> AEDPA?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> AEDPA.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Oh, yeah. No, no, no.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, no, no.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> This is a direct review</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> This is a straight  did they get  --</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> --from a state supreme court.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- if they -- if they reach the -- if they reach the constitutional question and we de novo decide whether they got the law right, correct?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> That's my understanding.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So whatever they said their reasons or thinking was, we have to look at the record and decide whether the facts and law support your argument that there were Brady and Napue violations, correct?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Now tell me succinctly why, even assuming their finding that they could have determined this issue earlier, Brady and Napue violations would have occurred?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Well, the --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I say ""they,"" meaning the court below.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Yeah. So, you know, the -- part of the adequacy determination, leaving aside this novel and unforeseen refusal to give credit to the -- the State's waiver of  procedural bars, is whether there is fair and -- ""fair and substantial support"" for the prongs of the State procedural defar -- departure. Here, the court's analysis of diligence, which is paragraph 27 of the -- the court's opinion, defies any reasonable application of state law. The  -- the supposition is that Mr. Glossip's lawyers should have brought a claim of constitutional error before they knew the salient facts establishing the error. In this context, we have, number one, with respect to the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It doesn't matter what state law says about that. The question  is what does federal law say about it, correct?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Federal law  -- you know, maybe I'm missing something here, but federal law doesn't  -- I mean, the federal requirement of adequacy and independence is federal law, and those -- that definition of fair and substantial support comes from  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You -- you misunderstood my question, okay?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Okay. I apologize.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I'm past the procedural bar.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I was past it long ago because I think we need to get to the federal question.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> I hear you.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right?  So even  --is there a Napue or a Brady violation if they could have discovered this earlier?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> The answer to that question is yes because the adequacy prong of this Court's  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Forget adequacy.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Okay. The answer is -- the answer is yes, the relevant  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Forget  -- let's assume they had granted your waiver.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right?  Let's assume that. So adequacy and independence is not at issue. Under federal  -- and this had happened, and it was the first case before the court, and they come up and they say:  There was  a Napue violation, there's a Brady violation. And your other side comes up and says:  No, there wasn't, because you could have found this earlier.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Okay. The answer to your question is twofold. Number one, as this Court has said in several cases, Brady and Napue do not stand for the proposition -- stand for the opposite of the proposition that the prosecution may hide and the defense must try to seek. That's the antithesis of what Brady and Napue and their progeny provide. In addition, it is simply preposterous to argue either with respect to the  --you know, what's -- the document that is in -- on page 1005 of the Joint Appendix, that is, the -- the jail record, that this document could have been discovered in the face of a solicited denial under oath that he'd ever had psychiatric  treatment, and the State's mocking of a discovery request, number one, for all -- the substance of all statements of Justin Sneed to the prosecutor, which is required not only by  the Due Process Clause but also under state statutory law, Title 22, Section 2002(a)(1)(C), which requires the prosecution to produce the substance of any oral statements made to  the prosecution by a co-defendant. And how on earth could defense counsel have known that in Ms. Smothermon's files there was a memo that she sent immediately after the medical examiner testified to Mr. Sneed's lawyer, saying we ""need to get to Justin today. The knife is our biggest problem,"" and then received back handwritten notes discovered in Box 8 that -- I guess it was Box 7  -- that, in fact, Sneed was going to change his testimony and say that he did stab the victim. And the prosecutor then, in response to a mistrial motion, affirmatively tells the court --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counsel, the -- the last  --</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> -- we're hearing this for the first time.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- the one fact you didn't mention is that there was a defense request for medical records --</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Absolutely.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- that were resisted by the government, and they succeeded. They never turned over his medical records.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So they had no way of determining from his medical records the lithium issue.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> You forgot Justice Kavanaugh.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Yeah, sorry. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So, from your colloquy with Justice Alito, it seems that there  is agreement that the court in this case applied the procedural bar, right?  I mean, at least you  -- it's in the alternative, but they did actually apply the bar, is that right?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> As -- arguably, as to Brady, not as to Napue.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> All right. So even with respect to Brady, I guess -- doesn't that seem to be the problem, though, from the standpoint of AISG when the bar has been clearly waived?  I think that was Justice Sotomayor's initial point. Can parties in Oklahoma waive non-jurisdictional procedural bars?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Of course.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> They can. Right.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Of course.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --and -- and what happens when those waivers occur?  I mean, do  -- do the Oklahoma courts routinely proceed to either evaluate the reasons for the waiver or reject it and continue on anyway?  I thought they just accepted  --if a party says, this is a non-jurisdictional bar, I have a right to raise it, but I'm waiving that  right, the Oklahoma court's standard practice, just like most courts, if not all courts, is to accept that and go on, right?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Yes. Like the federal courts, the Oklahoma courts honor the principle of party presentation and adversarial presentation in honoring the waiver of those non-jurisdictional bars.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> As a matter of practice. So we don't need a rule necessarily that Oklahoma always accepts these. They just do it. I mean, that's what  -- we don't have any evidence that they've ever rejected it, correct, the waiver?</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> And, in fact, the rule that this Court applies on the adequacy prong is that it is -- the refusal to accept a waiver is not adequate unless it has been done consistently in the past.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Correct. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text> Yeah. Nothing?  Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Mr. Clement.</text>","<speaker>Paul D.

I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Mr. Clement, back to the prosecutors. If you had -- if they were using a note of yours from 20 years ago, wouldn't you expect them to call you and have an in-depth investigation as to what your note meant?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I mean, I -- I would expect that, Justice Thomas, and --</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Well  --well, shouldn't these two prosecutors  --it seems as though their reputations are being impugned, and according to them, they did not receive an opportunity to explain in depth.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Justice Thomas, that's hard to square with the record here. There were two independent investigations. As Mr. Waxman  has indicated, Mr. Axley -- Ackley submitted a affidavit under -- under oath. And, you know, I -- and -- and, ultimately, I think the attorney general, having  commissioned a second independent review, looked at the results of that, looked at the notes. And he has to make his own judgment because, ultimately, the prosecutor has to decide whether a Napue violation has occurred.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Well, when I looked at the note of Ms. Smothermon, I couldn't make heads or tails of it. It had a few names. It had ""lithium"" and a question mark. And she explains what it was. And according to her explanation, if it's true, it was simply about a conversation that Glossip's lawyer had with -- was it Sneed?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Sneed.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Sneed. And if that's the case, I don't see how there's any basis for either of those two violations.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> So there's a couple of problems with that explanation, Justice Thomas. First, it's inconsistent with her earlier explanations for the notes. Second, when General Drummond is making this determination, the notes don't stand alone. There's also the medical information  sheet that was never disclosed to the defendants.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Where was that  -- what was that sheet?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> That sheet's at Joint Appendix page 933, and it shows that  -- that when he was transferred from the jail facility to the correctional facility, he was  -- he was under lithium for bipolar disorder. So, if --if -- if we're looking at those notes in conjunction with that medical information sheet, it seems quite -- the -- the inescapable conclusion that the attorney general had to make on his own was --</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> I think her point was simply, I mean, even that sheet  --is that the sheet that she says the sheriff filled out? That it didn't come from  --actually from a doctor?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Well, but -- but it's the  -- the State's own record --</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> It was a transport  --</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> --that at the point of transfer he was, A, under lithium, and, B, it was for bipolar disorder. And so I  -- I mean, again, I think you ultimately have to draw the most plausible inference from all the information available. And the most  --</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But you didn't, though. Her point is that you didn't ask her, that you didn't have an in -depth conversation with her about it. You're drawing it from the note and  --which she thinks is inadequate information.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Well, the attorney general is basing his judgment in part on the independent investigation of Mr. Duncan. He talked to Ms. Smothermon. Afterwards, Ms. Smothermon says it wasn't a sufficiently lengthy conversation.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> She's --</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I mean, at a certain point, I mean -- and  --but let me put one more contextual point on the table here. The original request below was for an evidentiary hearing, and the State did not oppose an evidentiary hearing. Now we think, if you look at those notes in light of the medical information sheet,  there's no need for an evidentiary hearing. But, ultimately, we  --we didn't resist it below. If the court had granted it, we wouldn't be here. And the attorney general just wants to get to the bottom of this, but he also, under Napue, has to make his own judgment about whether the prosecutors have elicited perjured testimony and failed to correct it, and his best judgment, based on these records and this information, is that there was a Napue violation here.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But are you saying that we are  -- that --that the question of Brady and Napue or a Napue violation is resolved because the attorney general has reached that conclusion?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Absolutely not. And we</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> All right. So why wouldn't we send it back?  I mean, it's my understanding -- if we send it back for an evidentiary hearing?  It's my understanding that  there's never been a court determination of any of these facts. Justice Thomas is saying there are some disputes about what the notes mean and whatnot. So I just  -- I guess I don't understand why we wouldn't, at the minimum, have some sort of requirement that a court make a  finding about these things?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I -- I mean, look, again, we didn't resist an evidentiary hearing below. We would be satisfied if you vacate the judgment below and order an evidentiary hearing. We do think an evidentiary hearing is not necessary here because I  --I -- I just think, if you look at those notes in conjunction with the medical information sheet, there's no factual dispute. I don't think there's any factual dispute that they -- that -- that, certainly, the two in conjunction with each other are Brady material. I don't know --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counselor --</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> --how they're not.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- whether the prosecutor actually knew about it, knowledge is imputed to her, right?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I -- I -- I would certainly think so, and so I don't -- I don't --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I think, under  -- under the law, anything in the prosecutor's possession, which includes prison records, is -- the knowledge is imputed to the prosecutor, correct?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Right. And, ultimately -- look, ultimately, the question is, did she elicit perjured testimony and fail to correct it?  And it seems like, especially when you look at it in conjunction with the medical records and then you keep in mind that the medical records were withheld in contradistinction of  -- or in contravention of Oklahoma law and Brady, I think there's only one conclusion to be make  -- made here. And you can certainly understand why the attorney general  --I mean, whoever is the -- if you think an evidentiary hearing is fine, I mean is necessary, then the attorney general will be there, confessing error again, because, as you can understand, given all the evidence here of the Napue violation, the Brady violation, I mean, even under the most -- even under Smothermon's explanation that these are notes that she took based on what the -- what Sneed told her, there's an obligation under Oklahoma law to turn over all the defense  -- all the  --all the witnesses' statements. So any -- and especially -- and, here, there was a request for it.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Mr. Clement  --</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> So  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I'm sorry. Please.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> No, no. So  -- so just looking at all of that material, the attorney general drew, I think, the only conclusion that he could.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Can I ask you, Mr. Clement, about some of the questions that Justice Alito was asking Mr. Waxman about, the whether there is an independent and adequate state ground here, and -- and -- and really focus on these couple of pages of the Oklahoma court's opinion, which I find difficult to say the least, and ask you what you make of them?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> So a -- a couple of -- things. One is I do think the easiest ground to  say there is not an adequate independent state ground here is the waiver issue as opposed to splicing the opinion. If you're going to splice the opinion</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> When you say ""the waiver issue,"" what do you mean by that?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I mean that it is an established principle of Oklahoma law and federal law up until this point that party presentation that procedural bars are defenses that the State has to invoke and can waive. And that is a hundred years of unbroken practice. McCarty is a perfect example of that. In some respects, I think the fact that there wasn't an elaborate explanation that they were accepting the State's waiver is kind of the point. When the State waives a defense, you move on and you discuss the merits, which is exactly what the Court did in the McCarty decision. This Court's decision in Trest against Cain, which was a unanimous decision, says that procedural default is a defense that the State must raise or it waives. So you just have this, you know, incredibly, like, unbroken tradition  that procedural defects, procedural bars are defenses that the State can waive.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And --</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> And, here, for the first time, they say no, that's -- that's for us to do, not for you to do, Mr. Attorney General.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And suppose we want to go beyond that because it is true that we rarely say that there's no adequacy because this -- this is so out of the ordinary. It  -- it's a very rare kind of thing for us to say. And if we want to just look at  -- at what the Oklahoma court did in terms of justifying its denial of the confession of error and its determination to proceed, how  --what do you  -- how do you describe what they did?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Sure. I think it's easy as to Napue, and it's a little more complicated as to Brady. As to Napue, I think paragraph 28 stands alone. It's their only resolution of the Napue claim. They don't talk about the procedural bars at all.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> There  --there might be in that paragraph, the last sentence is an oblique, very oblique, reference to the materiality prong of  --of the procedural bar statute.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Well, I read it differently. I read it as oblique reference to the materiality standard under Napue.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Of Napue, okay.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> But, if we're into the world of competing oblique references, that's when I think Justice O'Connor comes to the rescue and says that if you're not clear about it and it's ambiguous, then the federal issue is before this Court to decide.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And paragraph 27?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Paragraph 27, I think, is where the court is wrestling with the Brady issue. I think it's pretty clear that's Brady -- a Brady paragraph, not a Napue paragraph. And I think that --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And then you get, like  --that's all the way down, right, until the last sentence, which is the ""Moreover"" sentence, and the ""Moreover"" sentence might suggest, again, a reference to the procedural bar. Is that -- is that true?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> ""Moreover"" as to the Brady.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> It says ""this issue,"" and I think the ""this issue"" there is Brady. And that's an inference based on the fact that  the rest of paragraph 27 is all focused on what the defense counsel knew or should have known. And maybe that's marginally relevant for Brady, but it's completely irrelevant for Napue.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> At the most, what you have here in these two paragraphs is very significant discussions of the substance and then maybe a sentence about, oh, there's this procedural bar thing that we're doing too. Is that  --is that correct?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I -- I think that's correct. The other point I would make here --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And, you know, in a way, this actually relates to the first point that you made about how unusual it is to deny the State's request for a waiver here, because that's sort of what they start with. They say they have these two claims and the State has come forward and said this warrants post-conviction relief, and we're not accepting that because the State -- the State's concession is not based in law or fact. What --what do you take that to mean?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I -- I -- I just mean, you know, I'm not  -- you know, I just take that to be the back of the hand to the confession of  error. I think, if you  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, the State has only come forward with Napue arguments and Brady arguments, is that right?  So they must be saying we're not -- we're not going with the State because we don't agree with their views of Napue and Brady, as we're going to now explain.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I think that's a fair inference. I also think that one of the things that complicates this is  --and  --and maybe I read the one sentence a little differently than Justice Alito did, but they start with the Brady claim, you know, on the  -- on the merits, if you will, and then, you know, in the context of that, they basically say there was no Brady violation here because you should have known everything you needed to know from the fact that he had -- was taking lithium. And then I think that essentially infects the rest of the  analysis about diligence and all of the -- the rest. So I think this is a classic case where they are interwoven. But  --but I will say  -- and -- and -- and, you know, maybe you think that, you know, this is -- that the  adequacy prong is so rare that it doesn't apply here, but this does seem to me to be a classic case for it because  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Of interwoven; therefore, you know, not independent?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Well, yeah. Interwoven, not independent, but also inadequate because, gee whiz, you know, this Court unanimously has said, everybody has always said, look, if it's not jurisdictional, procedural bars are defenses that you can waive. Even this opinion isn't very clear about it. Paragraph 24 refers to 1089(D) as a procedural bar. Paragraph 40  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, whether -- whether  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And is it  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Mr. Clement --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- is it possible that -- is it possible that, you know, they know that they're doing something very unusual here, which  is rejecting the State's request for a waiver, and they're just throwing everything in the kitchen sink in?  They're saying, you know, we don't see the merits of these claims, either the Brady claim or the Napue claim. They're saying there's this procedural bar statute hanging around and we kind of think that that's been violated too. And we actually don't know, like, if you took this piece out, if you took that piece out, how they would have come out.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I -- I think that is fair, and I think that gets you into  Michigan v. Long and Coleman against Thompson. I also think it is fair to say what is clear is they have not accepted the State's procedural bar  -- the waiver of procedural bar defenses for the first time in -- in the court's history.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> But, Mr. Clement  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Mr. Clement, whether a procedural bar must  -- whether the waiver of a procedural bar must be accepted by the Oklahoma court is a question of Oklahoma law, right?  The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals can say:  We always accept these, we never  accept them, or sometimes we accept them, right?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> It's definitely a question of Oklahoma law, but --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> And you have exactly one case, McCarty, for the proposition that this must  --this waiver must be accepted. Exactly one. Have -- can you cite one other case where we've deemed a state decision inadequate for conflicting with one prior opinion?  I thought our decision said that there's inadequacy when they conflict with many  --with many ""past unambiguous holdings.""</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> So, at least according to the dissenters in Cruz, that was a case where you found inadequacy when there wasn't a single case on point, and it was a question of first impression. I would say, though, this. I mean, I think it's important to understand McCarty does not stand alone. I mean, in addition to accepting the State's waiver in McCarty, the  Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals on numerous occasions -- Valdez, Malicoat, both cases we  cite in our briefs -- they basically treat the bars as things that the court itself can relax or waive. And that is equally inconsistent with treating them as a jurisdictional requirement that can't be waived. That stands, again, against the backdrop of Oklahoma party presentation principles, this Court decision in Trest v. Cain. The Tenth Circuit has treated 1089(D) as a procedural bar that the State can waive. And I think, ultimately, the question for adequacy  --I mean, you know, this Court's cases say a law -- a rule is adequate -- a state rule is adequate if it's firmly established and regularly applied. The question for inadequacy is whether it's an unexplained departure from past practice.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further?</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Just one point with respect to the transport order. I think my concern is that in their letter, the prosecutors say they did not see the transport order until 2022. So my problem is, if they don't  --if they never saw it, then how is there a Brady or Napue violation?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> So I think there's a Brady violation because, whether they saw it or  not, it was something that was available to --</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> No. They say it was not in their files.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I -- I don't think -- I mean, you know, let's keep -- keep in mind the precise dynamic we have here, right?  This is -- the interview takes place before the second trial. So Glossip  -- I mean Sneed has been in state custody for close to five years at this point. He's been transferred from the jail to the correctional facility. I think the State is charged for Brady purposes with that transfer sheet being exchanged.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But wouldn't it matter that  --whether or not they have it?  I mean, you're  --again, I go back to the prosecutors. You're  --what I'm hearing  is, and they're hearing, is that they did not turn over Brady material or that they permitted false testimony to take place, and they're saying: Look, it did not happen. And why wouldn't they be interviewed? Why don't we have materials from them other than in an amicus brief in this case?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Well, with respect, Justice Thomas, you do have materials from them. Ackley's affidavit is in the Joint Appendix before this Court. And it's not like Smothermon never talked to anybody. She's talked to people at various junctures, and her story has changed over time. Again, I don't want to overstate the point because we didn't resist an evidentiary hearing  --</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But they are central to this. It would seem like any dealings with them would also be central and we would not be arguing about Napue and Brady if that had been cleared up.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I -- I -- I mean, I think they would still be submitting amicus briefs with new stories. And at a certain  point, you've got to deal with what is in front of you and what is in the record. And the attorney general had to deal what was in front of him and in the record. And particularly when you read the notes in light of that sheet, all of which is in the record now, I think General Drummond made the correct conclusion --</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> So -- so what are we to do with the point that they make that they were frozen out of the process?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I -- I -- I -- I -- they had access to both independent investigations. And I think, at a certain point, I mean, you know, this -- if I were in their positions, I'd be complaining about the process as well. But, you know, the  --the ultimate process that I think matters here is the process in Glossip's trial, and that was fundamentally distorted when he is allowed to make the lithium use innocuous by saying:  Oh, it was for, you know, a common cold, and I've never seen a psychiatrist.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Alito? Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> At least one of the two prosecutors was interviewed in some way because we have an affidavit from him that was provided before the OCCA while this case was pending, correct?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> That is absolutely correct.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Do you know a as a matter of fact or not whether or not the first prosecutor -- I can't say her name  --</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Smothermon.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- Smothermon, whether she was interviewed?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I mean, she was inter- -- I know she was interviewed by -- by -- by Duncan, who is the independent prosecutor appointed by the attorney general. I think she also talked  to people in the context of the ReedSmith independent investigation. But Mr. Waxman --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> --may be able to fill that in. But --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- so I -- I -- I'm having a hard time understanding what the current claim by both of them is:  We weren't  able to give our full story. They had  -- they were interviewed, correct?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> My understanding is that they were interviewed. I think they do not  think that the interview was as longstanding and as interactive as they had hoped. As I say, I mean, you know, it's -- it  -- they're -- they --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But there were  -- it  -- it wasn't as if they were boxed out?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I -- I don't believe that they were boxed out. And, again --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> --the attorney general here had  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Can I go back to your respectful consideration to an attorney general's confession of error, and Justice Jackson asked you whether the Court has to accept the confession of error, and you said no. And I think that's correct. The Court, as I understand the rule of confession of error, it's especially relevant to questions of fact, correct?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Not questions of law?  The court has to be satisfied that there's  a basis in law and fact for the confession, correct?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I -- I think, as to both, it's respectful consideration. And I think it's at its zenith when it's prosecutorial misconduct because I think the prosecutors are in a particularly good position to judge what -- I mean, you know, starting with:  What does ""Dr. Trumpet?"" in the notes mean in the context of a community where everybody knows that Dr. Trombka is the sole psychiatrist at the jail?  I mean, I think a prosecutor is going to have a -- a good basis to say everybody knows that's just some kind of shorthand for ""Trombka.""</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's an issue of fact, and the AG says:  If my prosecutor says she didn't know, I'm not accepting that because she should have known.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> And  --and -- and I don't find it plausible in light of everything  that I now have before me. And I -- you know -- and there's -- there's the question of what Smothermon had before her in 2003, but now there's the question of  --I mean, because I think the Napue obligation on the government is a continuing one. So, when they're looking at it, they're looking at the testimony that their prosecutor elicited. They're looking that -- at that in context of the notes and the medical information sheet. And General Drummond reached the conclusion -- regretfully, but reached the conclusion:  Our prosecutors elicited perjury here, and a man's going to go to his death. We can't allow that to happen.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And your view is that the result likely would have been different, right?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> We think the result would have been different with respect to the standard that's applied under Brady and under Napue.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And what -- can you spell that out?  I mean, I think it's obvious, but  --but spell out why you think that.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Well, you know, this is a case where there's just no disputing the fact that the State has one indispensable witness. That witness is Sneed. He's the person who committed the murder. He's the person -- until the police talked to him, Glossip was only charged as an accessory after the fact. So there's every indication this is the absolute critical witness. And if that witness lies on the stand, perjures himself on the stand, that seems to me that that could have a reasonable probability of leading to a different result for at least two reasons. One is this is the key witness, and the jury has just seen him under oath lie to their faces. And if that comes out  -- I mean, whatever other problems with his credibility that the prosecutors have at that point, they have a much bigger problem at that point. And without his testimony, there's no way to get the conviction of murder, let alone the death penalty. The second thing, though, of course, is that defense counsel, I think, logically, if  -- if  --if Sneed's testimony hadn't led them away from bipolar disorder, then they bring in a psychiatric expert and they make a big deal about how his confessed methamphetamine use, combined with bipolar disorder, makes him somebody who could act impulsively and violently, and that opens up a whole other defense for the -- for -- for -- for -- for Glossip. Now, to be clear, I'm in an unusual position here because General Drummond has not only confessed error, but he's made it clear that he's not going to drop this prosecution or doesn't accept that this is, you know, the poster child for an actual innocence case and he intends to -- to -- to -- to reinitiate criminal process. But I think he thinks that given the centrality of Sneed's testimony in this perjury, this  --this is not a conviction that can stand.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> On McCarty, so that is the only case, right --</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Well --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> -- that you have? I mean, otherwise, it's party presentation for a long time but not zeroing in on the procedural bar at issue here?  I just want to be sure I understand. I'm not trying to be hostile.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> And  --and -- and I'm not trying to be evasive. I don't view it as our only case because I think Valdez and Malicoat, both decisions of the OCCA that treat it as non-jurisdictional because they say the court itself can excuse 1089(D) if there's manifest injustice or a serious statutory or constitutional error. And  -- and -- and that's -- that's invoked even in paragraph 40 of the opinion here. So -- so I don't think -- the way I think of party presentation in all of that, I don't think that the court can have it both ways. If it's jurisdictional --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> --it's jurisdictional, and nobody gets to waive it. And so that's why I don't think McCarty stands alone. And, of  course, you know, we're talking -- the standard is unexpected departure.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Okay?  Here's  --here's the Attorney General's Office. We got McCarty, but we got Valdez, we have Malicoat, we have the Tenth Circuit saying 1089(D) is a procedural defense that we can waive --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Did you cite McCarty, or did -- I don't -- so, in the fourth -- let me make sure I've the sequencing right too. This is the fifth post-conviction application  --</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> -- right?  And in the fourth, they also refused to accept the confession of error and the waiver, right?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> That is true.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So, when the fifth came up, it wasn't as -- as much of a surprise, right?  I mean, why wasn't the attorney general  ready at that point to say, you know, but you -- there's McCarty and you can't -- you can't reject our waiver?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I mean, look, in a perfect world, I mean, you know, maybe we would have done that. But, in the real world, we thought we were waiving it. I mean, I know this is, like, in the weeds, but, you know, we expressly argue that the evidence is sufficient under 1089(C), which is the standard for the first habeas petition. So it's clear to everybody -- I mean, you know, my -- my friend and your friend, your Court-appointed friend, says, well, maybe it wasn't clear enough to the Oklahoma Court of Criminals Appeals. But it was crystal-clear to them that we were trying to waive it and they weren't going to let us. And I think the fact that, you know, yes, it's two cases in the history of man, both involving Mr. Glossip, I think that still puts us well within the edits. And the only thing I was going to add, and I know I said it before, but I think it's really powerful, is Trest, Trest against Cain, this Court unanimously says, yeah, of course, procedural bars, procedural default, that's a defense. The State can waive it. And the State can waive it not just by intentional relinquishment but by abandonment. That's Wood against Milyard. And, like, even if there's some question about whether we were  sufficient in intentionally relinquishing  it, we absolutely abandoned it. So I -- I -- I just think this is a case where -- and -- and there's a systemic issue here, right, because, I mean, it's Oklahoma law. They get to do what they want. But, if Oklahoma is going to say you can't waive under these circumstances, it's going to create a whole federal courts exam about how it is that a  -- a state prosecutor is supposed to confess error when they discover a Brady or a Napue violation after the first, like, state habeas petition has been filed. And, you know, I've tried to think through it all, and I think, at the end of the day, there must be a due process right to present that somewhere, but, boy, that's a --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> But we don't have that issue?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> It's -- well, I don't think -- you don't have it directly. And it's a lot harder issue than whether invoking this as an unwaivable jurisdictional bar for the first  time in the history of man is adequate. I think that's a far easier question than the due process question about is there some ability to bring this kind of confession of error to some court somewhere and get to the merits.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Okay. I want to ask you about the standard of review for looking at Smothermon's notes because one of the difficulties, I think, with the notes is that, putting aside whether the Van Treese brief is in the record, it's not, it still -- it still reveals that there are multiple plausible interpretations of the notes. So are we supposed to be applying kind of a preponderance standard, that we think it's most likely that they reflect that she knew about the psychiatric examination?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I think that's right. I think it is a preponderance.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Okay. Okay.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> And I think  --not be to be repetitive, but I think that's also the standard for the prosecutor because the prosecutor in the first instance, I think you want them to confess Napue errors. You want them to confess Brady errors. And I don't think you want them applying a clear and convincing standard or beyond a reasonable doubt. I think you want them to say straight up, if -- if -- if we blew it and there's a Napue violation here, we should confess it.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So just going back to Justice Barrett's question about whether McCarty is your only case, if I'm hearing you correctly, it is not because the principle that you're relying on is the fact that it is firmly established in Oklahoma law and procedure that non-jurisdictional procedural bars are waiveable and the courts accept those waivers. They do it when a party waives a non-procedural jurisdictional bar. So it's pretty much every case in which a non-jurisdictional procedural bar has been offered and accepted by the court, right?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> That -- that's our view. And I think it's buttressed by the fact that the Valdez and Malicoat cases, even though they're not sort of confession of error or express waiver cases, they show the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals treating 1089(D) as non-jurisdictional because, if it's non-jurisdictional, they can't excuse it because of  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right. So it fits into the category of a non -procedural  --a non-jurisdictional.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I think that part of the problem here that is what is confusing about Oklahoma's opinion is that they seem to be conflating which I  -- what I think are two different bases for not applying the procedural bar, right?  One is the waiver, and the other is potentially the confession of error. In your discussion with Justice Barrett, it's -- you talked a little bit about  Glossip IV. And in my reading of that, that was a situation in which there was a waiver expressly made, but I didn't know that there was  also a confession of error. Am I right about that in that?</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> You're absolutely right about that. In fact  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> All right. So --</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> --it was the least confession of -- I mean it was the furthest removed  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Exactly.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> --from a confession of error. It's like there's a lot of chum in the water and we just want you to decide the merits, but we think they are absolutely wrong.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And so I think that's really important because the prosecutor, I think, is actually making two different determinations that might be relevant to whether or not the procedural bar applies. The first is whether or not to waive it, which is what they do in Glossip IV. And the second is whether or not to confess error, which they go on to do in Glossip V. And only the latter, the confession of error, is the one that might call into question the  -- the, you know, reasons for it, the court saying, well, you're confessing error, but let me figure out whether or not it's based in law  and fact, and I'll only accept it under those conditions. If I'm right about that, then the real problem happened with its deviating from the ordinary practice of allowing parties to waive and accepting them. And that's why you said, I think, in response to Justice Kagan that the waiver track is the easiest way to understand why we don't have an AISG here.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Absolutely, Your Honor. And, again, just in all candor to this Court, I'm representing Oklahoma. Oklahoma, in a lot of other cases, is going to be saying that's adequate and independent state ground. But I think we want to be in a position where, if we make a determination that there's been a constitutional problem with one of our prosecutions, we want to be able to confess that error and get to the merits of it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, I understand, but I don't want to conflate the two. I mean,  when there is a waiver, courts don't ordinarily go into why you are waiving.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You say this is my right to press this procedural bar and I'm waiving it, and the court says, fine, we move on to  the merits of the argument. What happened here, I appreciate the attorney general goes on to explain the reason why he wants to waive it, it's a confession of error, but I don't think the court gets to reject the waiver if it disagrees with the confession of error because waiver is a separate basis for, you know, relinquishing the procedural bar.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> I agree entirely. And I think, ultimately, getting back to Justice Kagan's question, it may also explain why the opinion is sort of intertwined --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> --because --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> --they are sort of treating them as one and the same. In fact, I think --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Exactly.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> --you know, paragraph 25 or 26 specifically says the confession can't overcome 1089(D), which is perfect evidence that they've kind of conflated the two --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text> --because the confession isn't what overcomes 1089(D). It's the waiver that should at least historically everywhere but Oklahoma.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Mr. Michel.</text>"
8,2024.23-753-t01,"<speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Section 301(b)(1)(C) of the Clean Water Act assigns EPA the job of setting the effluent limitations necessary to meet and implement water quality standards. The water quality standards are not the limitations themselves. Instead, they set the goals for the water body. EPA must translate those goals into discharge limitations. The Generic Prohibitions fail this task. As Judge Collins explained below, the Generic Prohibitions erase the distinction between water quality standards and discharge limitations, making them one and the same. The Generic Prohibitions revive the very ""cause or contribute"" standard Congress repealed. And they do not function as discharge limitations. As the Second Circuit recognized, they add nothing that tells a permitholder how  to control its discharges. EPA claims it uses the Generic Prohibitions as a backstop, an insurance policy against changing circumstances. But the Clean  Water Act already gives EPA all the tools it needs to address uncertainty. EPA can reopen, modify, or terminate a permit when conditions change, and it can exercise its statutory authority to protect public welfare in emergencies. What EPA cannot do is expose permitholders to liability based on receiving water conditions it cannot control. The Generic Prohibitions are also inconsistent with the Act's permit shield. The shield protects permitholders from liability as long as they comply with their permit terms. But, by imposing indeterminate requirements, the Generic Prohibitions prevent permitholders from relying on the shield's protections. San Francisco is therefore exposed to crushing criminal and civil penalties even when it otherwise complies with its 300-page permit. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>John G.

Steeley</speaker><text> So San Francisco's permit is a Phase II permit, so we're not subject to the CSO policy for Phase I. But Phase I describes a narrative condition. The Generic Prohibition  -- our -- our concern about the Generic Prohibitions is not that they are narrative. It's perfectly fine for EPA to use conditions that are narrative, narrative water quality-based effluent limitations. And that's exactly what the CSO -- sorry, the CSO control policy requires. It  -- in EPA's own guidance, it describes what's required under Phase I, and it describes that as a narrative water quality-based --</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> So what is  --</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> --effluent limitation.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> -- with this permit, what is at bottom the problem?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> What at bottom is the problem is that permitholders don't know what they need to do to comply. We know how to comply with the 300 pages of our permit, which  tells us our discharge limitations that we need to achieve. The problem with the Generic Prohibitions is that they don't tell us what in addition that we need to do. And if I could provide an example of that. One of California's  water quality standards is no objectionable algae bloom should form in the water body. San Francisco doesn't know how it must control its discharges to prevent that condition from forming in the water body. And we can't know because whether a condition will form in the water body will necessarily depend on what other permitholders or other non-point sources are adding to the water body and the flow of the water itself. What San Francisco can control is our own discharges. We cannot control the receiving water conditions.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Are the water quality standards in state law?  I  -- I thought that the EPA permits were just incorporating obligations that already existed in state law. Am I wrong about that?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> I think that's not quite correct, Your Honor. The water quality standards set the goal for the water body, but they aren't self -executing. They have to be put into a permit. And what's -- what 301(b)(1)(C)  requires is that EPA meet and implement the water quality standards, which means translating  them into a  -- a permit limitation --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I know, but I  --</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> --that permitholders can follow.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- isn't EPA --I thought the statute allowed for ""any more stringent limitation, including those necessary to meet water quality standards, treatment standards, or schedules of compliance established pursuant to any state law.""</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So California has established certain water quality standards. Are those independently binding on the cities and municipalities in California?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> They are not binding. They are only binding as a permit limitation. And that's the problem here, is that we don't -- they're only binding  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Do they  -- do you have to have permits under state law so that they get bound  --you get bound through the state permitting process then?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> The permit at issue here is issued by  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, I understand. But I'm just  --</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- I guess my --my big problem is that I'm trying to understand why you find these permit provisions so onerous or problematic when they seem to just incorporate standards that already exist under state law that you would have to follow anyway.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> The standards are not self-executing, so we don't have to follow them anyway. They set the goals for the water body, but they're not limitations on us themselves.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So they aren't -- they are not binding on us.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- Ms. -- Ms. Steeley, I mean, there are lots of different kinds of regulations in the world. Some people like some kinds; some people like other kinds. Some  regulations are really prescriptive, do this, this, this, and this. And then, you know, some  people hate those kinds of regulations. They'd rather have regulations that are less prescriptive, that say here's the goal, you  decide how to meet it. That gives a party more flexibility and so forth. So, you know, some people, you know, it's  --there's got to be something in this statute that tells you that the agency can't decide to go the less prescriptive, more flexible ""you decide how to meet it; this is the goal"" route, and I don't see anything in this statute that does that.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So I disagree, Your Honor, that this provides a flexible standard. What  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Let's talk about the statute. Like, what in the statute prevents the agency from saying, in addition to or instead of the highly prescriptive, you know, you can only discharge X amount, we want to set a goal, and we want to tell you that you're obligated to not contribute to violating that goal?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So what the statute provides is that EPA must meet and implement the water quality standards. And those are transitive verbs. They necessarily, in our view, require taking concrete steps to meet -- to achieve the goal, right?</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> See, to me, this regulation -- what does this regulation do?  It says go meet and implement the water quality standards, because you were exactly right in what you said to Justice Jackson, as without this regulation, or not this regulation but this condition in the permit, you're not independently obligated to -- they're not enforced  --those standards are not enforceable against you. It's the permit condition that makes those standards enforceable against you by the EPA. So that's what this condition does. It -- it  -- it  -- it's  -- it's prescribing that you have to meet water quality standards. Like, how more clearly could you meet this statutory language than that?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So the problem is, is that it  -- it can be used as grounds for enforcement afterwards, but it doesn't tell permitholders in advance what we must do to control our discharges. So, in that sense --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> The problem is that there are discharges -- and we get a huge amount of them in the amici briefs  --of discharges that weren't anticipated. You were fine at the time of the permit, and then, all of a sudden, you've got chlorinated or potable water into the waters. So, if the water standards are not self-executing, which you admit, if they're not in the permit because they haven't been put into the permit, then what you're saying is:  Well, you can't do anything immediately, EPA. You have to start a review process that takes months and sometimes years to amend the permit and do something about it. This, instead, says to San Francisco: You should be monitoring the water. Don't let it exceed the water quality standards that we met and set together. Now you implement the changes that you think are appropriate to stop this unexpected discharge.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So I'm not --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I don't know why that's the wrong way to look at this.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> I think it's the wrong way to look at it, Your Honor, because, first of all, we are not saying EPA cannot take immediate action. The statutory scheme already provides  EPA with emergency powers. They can act immediately to protect public welfare under Section  -- sorry -- 1364.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> How can they do that?  They can't go to court unless there's a permit violation.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> They can go into court under their emergency powers.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Under their emergency.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> They can go into court --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we have to go to that extreme. So how do we get San Francisco to do something about its implementing -- its monitoring obligations?  It's supposed to monitor and look at things and, if things are getting out of control, figure out how to put them back into control.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So San Francisco's permit requires monitoring of receiving water  conditions, as you've noted. You'll see that in the Petition Appendix starting at page --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> --226.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- in this permit, this is not a permit involving entities -- multiple entities that are discharging into most of these waters. So most of these water, it's one permitholder, the City of San Francisco. It's combining sewage and rainwater runoff, correct, so it knows all of the point sources that contribute to that water quality  have effluent limitations because you can test those and see whether they're meeting standards. So, if something unexpected happens, it's because one of those water sources has gone awry, correct?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> That is not correct, Your Honor, and I have two responses to that. First of all, San Francisco is not the only discharger or contributor to the water body. There are eight discharge points at issue in this permit.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Those are the point sources that it's supposed to be --</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Sorry, no. So San Francisco has its own discharge points, and there are eight of them. One of them is  --I will concede is fairly far out into the ocean. We are the only source for that one. But the other seven have many other contributors to the water body very close nearby. And if I can give you an example, just a couple weeks ago, there was a bacteria spike near one of those discharge points. It's a point that we are not currently using, so we know we did not cause that spike, but someone else did. Had we been contributing to the water, had we been discharging at the time, we would necessarily have been contributing to that condition and we would be subject to liability.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But how about -- but my -- that's my point, which is it -- you can't get past the obligation to meet the water standards unless you put them into the permit.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So the way that EPA can achieve its goals here is to set a discharge limitation in the permit. And if I can correct perhaps a misunder- --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, so they should take each -- I see in the water standards  they're very detailed on any number of -- of discharges. You can only have X amount of feces  in the water, X amount -- or Y amount of bacteria. Pages and pages of measurements. You want them to write all of those  -- take the water standards, and instead of cross-referencing them and telling you to meet those standards, you want them to write each amount?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So, Your Honor, EPA's own regulations require it to set an effluent limitation whenever there is a reasonable potential that a discharge will cause or contribute to a water -- water body --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well, that -- that's the point I'm making. It does that. Where there's -- where they're exceeding the limitation, it tells it what technology to put into place to reduce it. But, if they're not exceeding it right now, how do they take care of the -- the unexpected situations?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> The permit limitations are set in advance, so they're anticipating what the discharge will do to the water body. But, if I can correct, I think, what maybe -- what maybe is a misunderstanding. We don't have real-time monitoring of receiving water conditions. Under our permit, we monitor bacteria on a once-a-week basis, and other things, including effects on animals, sediment, we monitor on a yearly basis, and it takes about nine months for the results to come back. So San Francisco cannot shift on a dime. We don't have the information necessary to know  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I'm sorry, no one's asking you to shift on a dime. What they're asking you to do is to become responsible for doing what's necessary, not on a dime, but -- nothing in the EPA works on a dime -- but to take the steps necessary to control situations that develop.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So, if I can provide another example of how this runs amuck, the --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> By the way, I do accept that there are some provisions of the water standards that are, charitably, a little amorphous. You know, control for the color of the water. But I think that's an as-applied challenge.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Yeah, can I just piggyback on that if you'll -- if you'll let me, Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Yeah, sure.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Is -- is, when I hear you speaking, I hear one of two things. One is that to the extent that you have objections to particular ones of these water quality standards  -- they're too confusing, they're too vague, we can't figure it out, how can you tell between us and other dischargers  -- I mean, that does seem like a classic arbitrary-and-capricious question. So you would go and make an arbitrary-and- capricious standard as to those particular standards that are in the permit. I mean, the second way I hear you, honestly, is  --is you're making a policy argument to either the agency or to Congress. You're making a policy argument to the agency, essentially:  Don't take advantage of your  statutory authority in this way because it's very confusing to us, the regulated party. Or you're making a policy argument to Congress:  Go  fix this statute so that the EPA can't do this. But what I don't hear you telling me is, like, what in the statute prevents the EPA from doing this. And, you know, as I said in the  --in my  --in my first intervention here, the policy arguments, they cut both ways. Some people like these kinds of standards. These kinds of standards  -- if the EPA couldn't do these standards, presumably, they would do something else, which might be more prescriptive, which some parties might really hate. So -- so that's such a policy argument that we can't figure out what in the statute prevents the EPA from doing this.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So, again, I would point -- I would point you to the requirement to meet and implement the water quality standards. As you noted, Justice Sotomayor, some of the standards are not -- they don't translate easily into a discharge limitation for San Francisco. And I don't agree that it's a policy argument. We simply want to know what we have to do --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> I  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I feel as though it's  --when you say ""meet and implement,"" I feel that those statutory words, they're practically a description of these permit conditions. You know, they  --they basically say: If  -- if  --you -- you don't have to do the -- just the standard effluent limitations if you think that a regulation is -- you know, further conditions are necessary to achieve the water quality standards. And the EPA is saying at the very least this:  We have to obligate you and other entities with permits to comply with those water quality standards. And that's  -- that's actually exactly what this statute allows the EPA to do.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So I don't agree that you ca n meet and implement the water quality standards by simply sticking a term in the permit that says:  Do not cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards. They might as well have said:  Do not violate the Clean Water Act. It doesn't tell us anything  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I thought -- I thought  --</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> --about how to control  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> I thought the  -- I thought the whole reason we have the water permit system is because the water quality system was a failure  --</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> That's exactly --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> -- because it didn't tell people in any predictable  way what they can and cannot do.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> That's exactly right. And Congress repealed that system. It replaced that system.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And -- and the -- and  -- I'm sorry, keep going.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Oh, no. It replaced that with a system where EPA is supposed to tell us our discharge obligations in advance. That was the entire basis for the Clean Water Act.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And I thought the statutory hook that you were relying on in (b)(1)(C), 301(b)(1)(C), was the phrase ""any more stringent limitation necessary to meet water quality standards.""  And you read ""an y more stringent limitation"" to refer back and mean effluent limitation. Is that your statutory hook?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> That's true, Your Honor. I would also point you to -- Section 301(a) sets the table for what the rest of Section 301(b) is going to accomplish.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Absolutely. 301(a) sets effluent limitations, and then, when it says ""any more stringent limitation,"" you say the fact that the word ""effluent"" is not there is  -- in context, it's obviously referring to ""effluent limitations"" and then ""meet water quality standards,"" right?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> That's correct, Your Honor. What --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I'm sorry. But you  -- you say narrative is okay. And that's not an effluent limitation. We also have our  own case that says it doesn't have to be an effluent limitation. And I still don't understand how you didn't forfeit this argument.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> First of all, it wasn't raised before the Ninth Circuit. It was  mentioned in the dissent, but, when you filed for certiorari, you didn't make this argument. And you now raise it -- I was quite surprised when I read the question presented and started your brief and thought to myself this is a new theory. How is that argument not forfeited?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So, Your Honor, we do not object to narrative water quality-based effluent limitations, and an effluent limitation can be narrative. What an effluent limitation is is a  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Just answer my question. Why didn't you forfeit this argument?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Okay. We did not forfeit this argument because we've argued throughout this case, including, you'll see, at  pages 24 to 34 of our opening brief, that our theory --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I'm asking about how you didn't forfeit it in your cert petition.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So what we are challenging here is the Generic Prohibitions.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And how did you not forfeit it in the court below by not raising it?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> We did raise  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> We're not a court of first impression.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> We did raise it in the court below, Your Honor. You'll see that at pages --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> The Ninth Circuit didn't -- didn't think so. I looked at your briefs from there. I don't think so either.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> The Ninth Circuit held that 301(b)(1)(C) is not limited to effluent limitations, which are restrictions on discharges. It did reach that holding. You'll see that at pages 32 to 33 of the Ninth Circuit's decision. And we argued this to the Ninth Circuit.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So I -- I don't --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> On the ""more stringent"" area -- question, if it's a different limitation, it's more stringent, isn't it?  Meaning you're defining ""more stringent"" as being more hardship on me than the effluent limitation. But doesn't that answer Justice  Kagan's point, which is anytime you have another obligation, it's more stringent?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> We don't agree that ""more stringent"" just means additional. I think, if Congress had meant that, it would have said so. And I think that's actually an important part of the statutory  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I'm not sure I understand that. I mean, these do impose obligations on you above and beyond what the technology -based limits do, isn't that right? You have to do more?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> I don't agree, Your Honor, and that's because we cannot tell. It does not tell us in advance how to control our discharges. But --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, either you have to do only what the technology -based limits tell you to do or you have to do more.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> But  this does not tell us what more we would have to do.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, for example, suppose a technology-based condition says, you know, don't discharge more than 75 gallons of sewage. And now, in addition to that, a water  quality-based condition says don't cause or contribute to meaningful discoloration. Isn't it more stringent than the first condition standing alone because, on a particular day, you might have to cut your discharges more to 60 gallons of -- per day?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So we --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> That is more stringent. Now it's 60 gallons per day because that's what's necessary to prevent discoloration.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So I have two arguments to that, Your Honor. One is this doesn't tell us how to control our discharges, so, in our view, it's not more stringent. And the second is, is that we judge permit terms at the time that they are set. When they are set, we cannot tell if it's a more stringent requirement or not because, depending  on conditions in the water body, it can be either more or less stringent at that moment in time, and so, therefore, it's not a more stringent restriction.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But isn't that the point?  I mean, do  -- do you dispute that Congress was attempting to have a backstop with respect to requiring or allowing for any more stringent limitation?  I mean, the word ""any"" in here also, it seems to me, does work to suggest that we don't have to stay within the world of effluent limitations. So how do you account for that? And isn't the point of having this that Congress understood that the (1)(A) effluent limitations might not be sufficient, so the authority was given to prescribe any more stringent limitation?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So I think you have to read ""any"" in context. I think my friends on the other side read 301(b)(1)(C) as meaning any limitation. That cannot be right. They've rest out  -- they've read out the rest of the words of that section. But I think I  --I want to  --I don't believe that 301 (b)(1)(C) is meant to be, you know, a all-encompassing backstop. I don't agree with that. In fact --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Well, what is it doing?  I mean, we already have  a provision that allows for or authorizes effluent limitations. And then we get to this one that says you can put in a permit any more stringent limitation. And  -- and speaking of reading out the words, it says ""including those necessary.""  So it's not even clear that ""those necessary"" is the sum total of the limitations. It says ""any more stringent limitations.""  So isn't -- doesn't that just on its textual reading suggest we're beyond the effluent limitations that were previously authorized?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So a couple responses that I'd like to give you if I may.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes, please.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> The first is that what an effluent limitation is, is a restriction on discharges of pollutants. We know from Section 301 that the entire section is about a restriction on the discharges of pollutants. So  we believe 301(b)(1)(C) is also about an effluent limitation, but it's necessarily narrow in scope, and if I can explain why. So technology-based effluent limitations, which are set under Section 301(b)(1)(A) and (B), are effluent limitations  that require controls using the best practicable technology that's economically feasible. What Section 301(b)(1)(C)  -- sorry -- Section 301(b)(1)(C) allows is additional controls regardless of their economic feasibility, regardless of cost. So those are necessarily a limited thing. They are used only when more stringent, only when necessary to meet and implement. They're not a catch-all.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right. I understand that point.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> They're not used all the time.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand  that point, but what -- what do we do with the fact that Congress chose, I think, to codify the EPA's interpretation of this  --of this -- the CSO control policy, and that policy, it's my understanding, explicitly endorsed the kind of  permit provisions at issue here, those that regulate sewage treatment that incorporate water  quality standards beyond effluent limitations?  Is -- do you -- do you dispute that Congress endorsed the kinds of permit provisions that exist here?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Absolutely. We absolutely --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> --dispute that . So my friends on the other side are not relying on the CSO policy as their source of authority and wisely so because the CSO policy does not give them the permission to put in conditions like the Generic Prohibitions. We are a Phase II permit, which expressly requires water quality-based effluent limitations. Even under Phase I, Phase I allows narrative water quality-based effluent limitations. There's nothing in the CSO policy that suggests that Congress  -- that EPA could simply impose something like the Generic Prohibitions, leave San Francisco to figure out its discharge obligations on its own. Congress  --there's nothing suggesting that Congress had that in mind or blessed that system. In fact, when Congress was asked, you know, do we want to leave permitholders to figure it out for themselves or assign EPA as  the agency to set limitations, it chose the latter approach.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further?</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Are there  -- not in your case, but are there any provisions -- is there any prohibition in 1311 against  E -- EPA having the generic limitations in a -- in a plan for someone else?  Just generically, not you.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Is there a prohibition?</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Yeah. Are they precluded from having generic limitations?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> I don't think there's anything expressly precluding them, but -- except that they are not authorized to do so, right?  EPA only has authority when authorized. And so I think Section 301 is silent about Generic Prohibitions. It doesn't authorize them.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Well, let me ask: Can EPA impose generic limitations on anyone?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Why?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Because they point to Section 301(b)(1)(C) as their only source of authority to impose Generic Prohibitions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> And that provision does not allow it.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> And why is that?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Because what can be imposed under Section 301(b)(1)(C) is limitations on discharges. Those are effluent limitations. They need to tell permitholders their obligations. That's the entire point of that section and its requirements. So, by imposing a Generic Prohibition, they're simply telling us to figure it out for ourselves, which we think is contrary to the statutory scheme.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> So would you have a -- an arbitrary-and-capricious claim if you did not bring this as a statutory claim?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> The government says that there are no other significant point or non-point sources of pollution around the Southwest Ocean Outfall. Assuming for the sake of argument that that is true  --I heard you to dispute it earlier in your argument  --but assuming for the sake of argument that it is true, why couldn't you then figure out what is necessary for you to do to comply with the water quality standards?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So, if I can just clarify first, there are eight outfalls at issue. So they're saying at one of them that is true. They don't contest that the other seven, that is not true. But the reason is, first of all, Congress assigned EPA this task, not us. But the practical answer is, is that we can't know what we can discharge without knowing in real time, minute by minute, what the conditions are in the receiving waters. That will include the water flow, its currents, and also what others have added to the water body. For instance, if we're trying to meet a  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, it sounds like what you're saying there is not that you object to the fact that EPA hasn't told you what you  need to do but that there is really no practicable way of specifying in advance what  you are required to do, and, therefore, you can continue to have these combined sewer overflow events where you're discharging raw sewage into the Pacific Ocean.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> There is a way to tell us in advance, and EPA has done so. It has set effluent limitations in our permit. What EPA hasn't told us is what additional we need to do under the Generic Prohibitions.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And you haven't told me what you do with unanticipated discharges. You ignore them until the permit is amended?  Is that your answer?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So, if a discharge is not anticipated, if it wasn't disclosed to the agency, then it's an unauthorized discharge. It's simply prohibited under Section 301 --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, it's not, because the permit tells you what you can or cannot discharge. That's based on what -- and how much. And that's based on what we know you're doing. If you're okay on day one in discharges, we're not going to tell you not to do more. We're giving you permission  --</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So what I'm  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- to discharge.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Right. So, if -- if -- if something is not grant -- if you have not been given the authority to discharge a certain, you know, something  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> The way the permit</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> --a certain constituent  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- the permit -- the way the permit operates is, with the permit, you can discharge anything that the permit tells you you can't. It works in reverse. It tells you you can't do this thing more than that amount. If it doesn't tell you you can't do this thing, you can continue doing this thing until the permit tells you you can't.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So the  -- the way it works is that the permitholder goes to EPA and says:  This is what we plan to discharge. And  then, if you have disclosed that to EPA, then they set the limitations, and that's the scope of your ability.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So what they should do is  --</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> That doesn't allow you to then  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- what you told me earlier not to do:  come in and tell you, using the technology you're using now, ensure yourself that you're not doing more than X amount of feces in the water?  Would that be  an okay limitation?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Certainly. EPA can say this is the limit  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So rewrite the  --</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> --that you can discharge.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- water quality standards. Just bring them all into the permit instead of cross -referencing them and say:  You can't have at this point source more than X amount of feces discharge. I suspect that Justice Kagan is right that if they start doing something -- because computers now can make that a very easy task  -- then you'll come in and say the permit is not comprehensible because it's so long and convoluted.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So our  -- our permit is already quite extensive, and I -- I don't --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well  -- well, you're just ask -- asking to add more.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> I'm not asking -- I'm  -- I'm not asking for EPA to add more. What I'm asking is for clear guidance to permitholders about what we have to do to comply with our permit. And I will say that I'm not sure that it is true that others like this. The regulatory community has lined up in the amicus supporting San Francisco. But, in terms of what EPA can do, EPA can reopen the permit. It can modify a permit. But  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Months and years.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> If it -- if it has --if it has any reasonable basis for concern, even anticipatory, right, if it anticipates that  there may be a problem causing or contributing</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Months and years.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> I'm sorry?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Months and years.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> I mean, it can take as little as six weeks to three months  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Only if you're cooperating. All right.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> I'm not sure  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you. That's fine, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan?</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> If I understood your response to Justice Thomas, Justice Thomas said: What prevents the EPA from doing this?  You said:  1311(b)(1)(C) doesn't authorize it because this is not an effluent limitation. But, of course, (1)(C) does not talk about effluent limitations. (1)(C) just talks about limitations. (1)(A) talks about effluent limitations. (1)(B) talks about effluent limitations. You were adding a word to (1)(C) to get effluent limitations there, weren't you?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> No. I disagree that we're adding a word. So Section --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, you're definitely adding a word because there's only ""limitation"" there.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So Congress used ""limitation"" as a shorthand for effluent limitations throughout this section. And if I can explain. So Section 301(a), not 301(b)(1)(A) but 301(a), tells us that the universe of Section 301 is about restrictions on discharge of a pollutant. That's the very definition of an effluent limitation. So we believe that the limitations throughout -- and the title also suggests that the limitations throughout Section 301 are limitations on discharge.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, throughout this statute, it says effluent and other limitations. And then, in this particular section, it says effluent limitations, effluent  limitations. And then, when it gets to this kind of backstop provision of something else is necessary, it just says limitations. Okay. I have another question for you, which is, you know, you spend a lot of your brief talking about this legislative history of  the statute and suggesting that what the statute was designed to do was to go from a water-quality- based system to an effluent  --to a technology-based effluent limitation system. And that's  --you know, I suppose, if you really wanted to write the picture broadly, you might say that. But there are plenty of places in this statute where water quality makes an appearance. And, indeed, it makes an appearance in this very provision, which is the source of authority for what the EPA did here. You know, it says, well, if the effluent limitations aren't doing enough, EPA can do other limitations that are necessary to meet water quality standards. That's what the text says. We usually don't look at, like, the broadest possible reading of legislative history to do something that's exactly counter to what the relevant textual provision says.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> It's absolutely true that Congress preserved water quality standards,  but they preserved them as a basis for setting discharge limitations. So it's -- it's -- there's no conflict between preserving water quality standards and  setting discharge limitations. In fact, that's the way that you preserve the environment. That's the way you protect water quality standards, is you tell permitholders in advance what we must do to control our discharges. But the question presented here  is about the --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Thank you, Ms. Steeley.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Gorsuch?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Ms. Steeley, as I understand your argument  --I just want to make sure I understand it  --there are -- there are two arguments. One is that (b)(1)(C) should be read to regard effluent limitations. That's your primary argument. I had thought in the briefs that there was a backup argument that, nonetheless, whatever it has to be, it has to be a limitation  on your discharges given that that's what 1311(a) is all about, the discharge of any pollutant by a person, except -- except as specified here, is unlawful and that whatever  the limitation is, it can't be the applicable water quality standard itself because that -- that is used in contradistinction with limitations throughout this statute. Is that -- is that correct?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> That is correct. I would only quibble with the idea that if there's a primary and secondary argument, what a restrictional discharges are is an effluent limitation. So I think those arguments are one and the same.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> But  --</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> But, yes, our  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- but, if -- if we disagree on that and  --or at least don't want to reach it  --</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- the point -- the secondary point remains  --</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Absolutely.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- we have to deal with?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Absolutely, that's correct. I mean, the question presented here is about the -- is whether the Generic Prohibitions  are authorized by law. And those Generic Prohibitions re-create the test -- the statutory scheme Congress rejected, so we think they are not.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> A few questions. Just to pick up on Justice Thomas's question when he asked if anything prohibits, your response  --and I just want to make sure I have this clear -- was nothing in the statute authorizes something like the generic limitations, correct?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And that -- and your point about water quality standards, I want to make sure, I think with Justice Gorsuch, the water quality standards are the goal or the end, that the statutory means to that end that are authorized by the statute are the effluent limitations?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> That's exactly correct.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And when you say narrative effluent limitations, I think Footnote 22 of your brief talks about that and you've mentioned it at oral argument. Can you --and Justice Sotomayor picked up on that. Can you just describe briefly what you mean there?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Sure, and maybe an example would be helpful.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> In Sa n Francisco's permit, for instance, we have a narrative water quality-based effluent limitation that requires San Francisco to increase its rate of pumping when wet weather is expected. So, if there's a 30 percent chance of rain, we have to clear capacity in the facility so that we are able to absorb the capacity of stormwater. That's a narrative  water quality-based effluent limitation. It tells us about the rate  of our discharge, so it's squarely within the definition of effluent limitation, but it's simply a narrative form. And we don't object to that. It's  --it's perfectly fine to use words or numbers. We just want to know how to  control our discharges and not have our compliance determined based on conditions in the receiving water.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And then the practical way this works, to pick up on Justice Alito and Justice Sotomayor's questions, let's say there are 10 different entities discharging at a particular source. If the water quality is not good in that area, EPA can go back to one or more of the 10 and tighten up the effluent limitations in the permits, which may take some time, as Justice Sotomayor points out, and you quibble with that, but, in any event, that's the means for EPA to do this, right?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> That's exactly correct. I mean, that tells permitholders their -- the obligations they need to meet, so it  -- it -- yes, that's exactly how the statute is stated.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. And the overarching problem, I think, but you haven't gotten to this, so I'm going to give you -- you know, in terms of how this all works is you don't know what your obligations are ahead of  time and yet you're on the hook for millions of dollars and potential prison time even though you didn't know what your obligations were ahead  of time, which strikes at least me, I mean, as more  --as definitely a policy problem but one that's rooted in the statute. You don't know what your obligations are and you can go to prison.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Exactly. Right. I mean, it's hard to imagine --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> What are -- what are you on the hook for?  There's an EPA suit against you. What is the amount San Francisco is on the hook for for something they didn't know they needed to do?  At least that's your claim. What's the amount?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> What's the amount?  So the statutory penalties are 66,000 per day --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Per --</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> --per violation. So that can add up quite fast. In the  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> They're seeking how much from you?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> I think it's in the -- it's in the millions. It's over 10 years of -- of penalties that can add up quite quickly.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Yeah. Okay. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So I understand that you say that the issue here is whether the Generic Prohibitions are authorized by law. Is that right?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And that's the core of your argument, and that you say that Congress did not contemplate this, having this general prohibition  -- Generic Prohibition. But I guess I can't square that with 33-1342(q)(1), which is the 2000 amendment in which Congress  appears to be saying that each permit for a discharge ""shall conform to the Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy"" signed by the agency. And then,  when you look at the control sewer overflow control policy -- or the Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy, that policy, I think, the longstanding policy of the agency, was to include these generic kinds of -- what you call generic kinds of limitations. I mean, it's very explicit in the policy. It says the authority should at least require permittees to comply with the applicable water quality standards. And, apparently, EPA had guidance that said it didn't matter whether this was Phase I or Phase II; these kinds of permitting conditions we're going to put in our permits. So how can it be, given the amendment here, that Congress did not intend for these kinds of provisions to exist in permits?</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So there's nothing in the policy that authorizes the Generic Prohibitions. What Congress was authorizing is that EPA set limitations in a permit that require our compliance with water quality standards. They can do that through effluent limitations. Our  -- you know --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, Congress was very specific. It said we are requiring the permits to ""conform to the,"" capital, ""Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy.""  It was  referencing a particular policy that had been established by the administration that included the Generic Prohibitions that you say Congress did not consider, endorse, or whatnot.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And I don't understand how that's possible.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> So there's nothing in the policy itself that says, EPA, impose restrictions on causing or contributing to a violation of water quality standards alone. That's what  -- that's not what the policy says. For  -- as we've discussed, for Phase II permits, the policy expressly requires  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Was it EPA's  --</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> --water quality-based effluent  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- was it EPA's guidance and weren't they saying this is what you have to do pursuant to our policy?  It would -- EPA has never taken the position, I think, that their own policy did not require these.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> EPA's policy, not  --so EPA's guidance --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> --not the policy itself,  but EPA's guidance says conflicting things. It sometimes says, for both Phase I and  for Phase II permits, that both require effluent limitations. Other times, it gives something  that looks like the Generic Prohibitions as an example of what to do. I think that just simply reflects the confusion. But what Congress actually blessed or required is compliance with the policy. And the policy does not require or authorize anything that looks like the Generic  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> One final thing. Did  you -- did you waive an arbitrary-and- capricious claim?  I know Justice Thomas was talking about -- with you about having an arbitrary-and-capricious claim. But I thought you ha d waived that.</text><speaker>Tara M. Steeley</speaker><text> Our argument before this Court is that the condition  -- the Generic Prohibitions are not authorized by law.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.

I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Mr. Liu, do -- do you agree that 1311 seems to focus primarily on  effluents and discharge?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I think most -- basically, all of the provisions of 1311, except for 1311(b)(1)(C), focus on effluent limitations.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Okay. Now that provision, (C), talks about limitations, including those necessary to meet water quality standards, and it also talks  --mentions ""or required to implement any applicable water quality standard.""  How exactly does the generic limitation do that?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> It does in two senses. We think that phrase, ""necessary to meet or implement water quality standards,"" imposes two limitations on our authority. One, we can invoke (b)(1)(C) only when we lack assurance that the other limitations in the permit are insufficient to protect water quality. We think we've satisfied that condition here. The court of appeals so found,  and San Francisco hasn't sought review of that. We think that language imposes a second limit, which is that for a limitation like this to be necessary, it needs to be  necessary in the sense that EPA lacked the information necessary to develop a more -- more tailored information. And, here, that's satisfied too. I want to be clear about the sort of information that we're missing that made it impossible for us to impose anything other than these generic limitations. It's not information about the water. It's information about San Francisco's own sewer system. We're talking about, where do the flows go?  What's the conditions of the pipes and the pumping stations?  How does the system respond to wet weather events?  That's the information that we've been lacking for the past 10 years and that we asked San Francisco to provide as part of the long-term control update. Without that information, we're basically flying blind as to how we're going to  tell exactly what San Francisco should do to protect water quality.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Well  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Counsel  -- I'm sorry.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> The  -- I don't understand -- you know, the bad old days is when we had water quality standards, right, people didn't know what they were supposed to do, how it was going to be allocated, sort of a problem with the  --the comments, and they put in the permit system. And I think the danger here is that you're going back to the other system because it, one, gives more power to you because you don't have to tell the people who are discharging what they have to do or not, you can sit back, and then  -- and also you don't even have to allocate among many different polluters who's responsible for -- for what. So what prevents you -- I know you touched on a couple of things in response to Justice Thomas, but I'm not sure that was significant limitations from saying, as you're doing here, we're going to go with water quality standards because that's maybe harder for the people with effluent, but it's a lot easier for us?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> No, it's not easier for us. In our ideal world, we would have perfect information about how San Francisco's system works, and based on that information, we would be telling San Francisco things like:  Reroute flows from X to Y. Upgrade your pumping station at Sea Cliff. Increase the storage capacity of your Westside storage facility. We were unable to include limitations of that tailoring in this permit because San Francisco deprived  us of the very information we would need to do that. So we don't  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> How do you --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> We have no interest in putting in generic provisions like this when we have the information available to supply more tailored information  --more tailored limitations. And that's why  --it's precisely because it's so much easier to enforce a more tailored limitation. These limitations --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with multiple people discharging effluent and you have a water quality standard?  There are eight different industries, 10 different water districts, whatever. They're all doing it. And you look at the water quality and you say  there's too much of this.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do then?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Well --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> How do you allocate who's -- this was the problem that led to the permit system. I mean, how  do you allocate responsibility for that?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> There are provisions in this statute that authorize states in their development of water quality standards to apportion pollutant loads to different polluters. 1313(d) is an example of this. But I don't think that concern about multiple dischargers is any reason to throw out all of the receiving water limitations in this case. That sort of situation might be the basis for an individualized sort of as-applied type of challenge to a provision like --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> No, no  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, how would an as-applied challenge work in that case? Somebody's supposed to come and say:  Well, you put this much on me. I think you should put different amounts on those other three because I think they're doing more or they can afford more or they are  -- they have more modern plants. And you're just going to go back and say:  Well, this is how we -- we want to allocate?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Oh, no, the statute supplies plenty of tools to address the problem of an overpolluted water body. The state can -- can grant a variance or an exception from  its standards, as we've actually granted San Francisco --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> I'm talking about the specific question of allocating responsibility for the water quality to different point sources.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Oh, well, one way to do it is for the state to say:  Look, we recognize this water body is overpolluted. Let's grant a  variance to certain of the dischargers so that they can continue doing their business.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> But do  --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> But  --but I --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Keep  -- keep going.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> -- I just want to make this point. Their rule isn't going to fix the problem of the overpolluted water body. If a -- if a water body is, in fact, overpolluted, thus leaving no room for anyone else to pollute, the appropriate effluent limitation in that case is going to be zero. It's not as if Petitioner's rule is going to magically allow dischargers and petitioners  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> I don't understand that answer, it could be zero, but it doesn't  --it may not have to be zero across the board. It may be 20 percent in each of the point sources. It may be 10 percent in the antiquated system that can't do any better but 30 percent in someone else. And I'm saying what the permit system was designed to do was give some notice to the different dischargers about what was going to be  required of them. Your water quality system gives you complete discretion in which -- who's  going to bear the burden and who's not.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I don't think that's right. Like  --like I said, there are multiple tools in the statute that address that problem. There are variances that the stat es can  -- can provide. There are schedules of compliance that EPA can provide in issuing the -- the standards. The CSO control policy discusses apportioning pollutant loads so as  -- so each discharger can stay within the loads.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> But the problem is you can go after an individual entity like the City of San Francisco based on the past, when they didn't know what the relevant limitation on them was, and seek retroactively, without fair notice, huge penalties, including criminal punishment, based on something that was -- they didn't know what they could discharge or not discharge, correct?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I don't  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I mean, a lot of what you're talking about in response to the Chief Justice is here's things that could help going forward.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> You're suing San Francisco separately for a lot of money based on a standard that they had  no idea -- you know, at least that's the theory.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> No. I mean --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> That's the theory. And your position  -- your position would allow that.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I don't  --I don't think so.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Yes, it would.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I mean  -- I mean, the Bayside complaint is Exhibit A for why what you said is not going to be true. The standards that are violated in those cases are numeric water quality criteria.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> The standards -- the generic limitations contain water quality standards that you don't know as an individual entity what you need to do to comply with that.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> You know, San Francisco has not pointed to any instance of that. The best shot they gave at pointing to a limitation that they said they didn't know what the meaning was was a standard that said marine communities can't be degraded. Well, if you look at  Petition Appendix 143, there's a definition of degrade in Attachment A to the permit. That definition spells out exactly how one goes about  figuring out how marine communities --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> They talked about the algae just now. They talked about the natural taste, odor, and color of fish.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Yeah. And, you know, you can look at Footnote 2 of their cert reply brief, and it says San Francisco did not challenge the clarity of any water quality standard below. And, you know, we're talking about quality for the first --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> That's because they say, as an antecedent matter, you don't have the authority under the statute to do so. They would have, if they did -- you did have the authority, separate arbitrary-and-capricious challenges.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> And my point -- my point is there's no reason to invalidate all of these on their face. San Francisco --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Yeah. No, that -- the facial challenge thing's a total distraction. The question is whether the  statute authorizes these kinds of generic limitations. It really comes down to what Justice Kagan was talking about, how you read  that precise sentence in 301.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> And if  -- and if -- and if Congress had wanted to do away with these standards as limits entirely, it would have simply adopted the Senate version of the bill that was before it. The Senate version accomplished exactly what San Francisco is urging here. It very meticulously put the word ""effluent"" into 1311(b)(1)(C) and then meticulously, in all the other provisions that cross-reference 1311, deleted ""or other.""</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> May I ask, Mr. Liu, is this a multiple discharge situation?  There seems to be some conflict between the government's position and San Francisco's position on that. As I understood Ms. Steeley, she said that's true of one, what you say, but it's not true of all eight. What's the situation there?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> It's -- so there's no dispute it's true of the one, and the one is the only outfall at issue here because the one is  the only federal outfall. There's a division of jurisdiction here between the federal government  and the states. The states are the permitting authority for all the near -shore outfalls. That's the seven outfalls that my friend mentioned. But the only Respondent here is the federal government. We are responsible for permitting the  --the Southwest Ocean Outfall, which is 3.3 miles into the Pacific Ocean.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I see. And if -- this issue of, like, we  don't know what we're supposed to do, it's horribly unfair, and  -- and you think, well, they've really not come up with any particular way in which that's true, I mean, I thought that most of these were something like this:  There's a California water quality standard that says waters shall not contain floating material in concentrations that adversely affect fishing and swimming. And it turns out EPA says that, notwithstanding that standard, San Francisco has left lots of toilet paper floating in Mission Creek. I mean, that's not a ""we don't know what  to do"" issue. Like, we know you're not supposed to leave toilet paper floating in Mission Creek, don't we?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> That's right. And  -- and --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And that's one example. There are plenty of others.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, but this  -- there -- I mean, there might be examples where they don't know something, although they haven't come up with any --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> They haven't.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- but there are plenty of examples. I could go on and on. There are plenty of examples where it's obvious. You know, don't, like -- like, spew the kind of chemicals that discolor the water.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> It would -- it would be --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> When you have brown water --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> -- it would be strange if concerns that are individualized to other types  of limitations that may or may not be vague cause the court to throw out the whole set of these types of limitations.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> So  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Mr. Liu  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> -- we should -- so we could limit the decision to items like that, but in terms of particular concentrations  of chemicals that you cannot see floating in the water, we would have  --we could reserve that decision because that interferes with the permit system in a way that the others may not?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> We would certainly appreciate a decision from this Court that was tailored to the particular concerns that may be motivating Petitioner's position. But, to be clear, we understand Petitioner's legal argument in this Court, the textual hook on which they've hung their entire presentation, to be a facial challenge to these limitations  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Can you agree --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> It's just a  -- it's just an argument that the statute doesn't authorize these kinds of  --of conditions.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> And  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And the answer is just yes or no for us.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> And I don't think there's anything in 1311(b)(1)(C) that says  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I  --I get that.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> -- San Francisco can -- EPA can include a standard that says don't cause  floatable materials to be in the water.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> And you agree that all of these concerns would make you vulnerable to an arbitrary-and-capricious challenge. Let's just assume they're all right. I know you're disputing that they're vague  --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Yeah. Absolutely.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> -- or that they're not on notice, but if they were, you would be vulnerable to an arbitrary -and -capricious challenge?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Yes. I mean, in this very case, San Francisco brought three variations of that type of challenge. They said the existing limitations in the permit are already sufficient. You don't need to resort to (b)(1)(C). They said these limitations are vague. They said we gave you the information in the  -- we don't need to provide you more information via the updated long-term control plan to  -- to --to create more tailored limitations.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> How common are these permits?  These ones that are more generic, narrative form, and they're getting at  non-effluent limitations.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> So I would separate the universe into -- into two buckets. There are individual permits like these, where we're talking about an individual discharger. And then there are general permits that we issue that cover a whole swath of -- of discharges within a particular geographic area, like all construction sites, for example. These types of limitations are pretty common in the general permits, and the reason why is precisely because of this information problem. The more information we have, the more tailoring we can do. The less information we have, the less tailoring we can do. And the general permit context is one where we and I think all the dischargers value efficiency and very little administrative burden. So we don't ask for a lot of information, and they don't give it. In exchange, we do include these type of ""Generic Prohibitions.""  In the individual permit context, it's -- it's -- it's as applied to the circumstances. It really depends on where we are in the development of a permit. The --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> How often do you seek criminal penalties?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> We have never sought  --I am not aware of any instance, and I have been told we're not aware of any instance, in which we have pursued criminal prosecution of a municipality that violated a condition like this.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Mr. --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And if we  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> -- Mr. Liu, you said at one point that you lacked the information necessary to provide a more specific provision than the provisions that are in question here. But is there anything that prevented you from obtaining whatever information you thought you needed?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Yes, San Francisco. Under this statute, San Francisco  -- (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> You have no  -- you have no ability and the state has no ability to require them to produce any information that --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> We did require them. We issued information requests under 33 U.S.C. 1318(a). All of that resulted in San Francisco coming up in 2018 with what it called a long-term control plan synthesis. That synthesis did not reflect current conditions. Why?  Because the most recent document in that plan was dated in the 1990s.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> And do you have  --do -- when a regulated party doesn't provide the information that you think you need, do you lack tools to require that to be done?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> We  --no. We -- what we did here, because it had been five years since their last  --last permit had -- had expired, the only way we thought, the best way left to get the information was to put the requirement in the next permit. And so, in the instant permit, we said, as a condition of this very permit -- this is Petition Appendix 131 to 138 -- please provide us with the information we need to develop more tailored limitations. And in that request, Pet. App. 135, we said, while you're at it, why don 't you tell us what additional control alternatives you think make sense given your existing infrastructure --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. So  --so</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> -- and the cost.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> -- do you want us to hold  --and maybe this would be an appropriate disposition of this case  --that permit requirements like these are required  -- are permitted in the specific situation in which EPA or the state has made every reasonable effort to get the necessary information from the regulated party and the regulated party has refused to provide the information?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> We think that is  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> In that limited situation, you can resort to this sort of permit condition?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> We think -- our reading of the  -- yes. Our reading of this statute is these -- to --to satisfy the requirement that these be necessary to implement, they need to be  necessary in the sense that we lack the information necessary to develop more tailored information.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, that response and some of the other arguments that you've made suggests that perhaps what you're saying is that we never should have granted review in this case to review the broad question that was presented in the cert petition.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I am saying that. I mean, just track the shifting positions that we've seen thus far. The  -- the --the cert petition -- the certiorari petition focused on whether these provisions were too vague or not specific enough. We responded that -- to that in our opposition. And the response we got on the cert -- in the cert reply was we're disclaiming any argument that any standard or any limitation was too vague. We're shifting to an argument based on the meaning of ""effluent limitation"" and the definition of it. We get their opening brief. It's consistent with the cert reply. But then page 3 of their merits reply starts out by saying, even  if this provision does authorize things other than effluent limitations, they're still invalid.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Mr. Liu, can I invite you to go back to the text and comment on the statutory interpretation question, which is what I understood counsel on the other side to say this all reduces to whether or not the statute authorizes these kinds of generic limitations?  Her argument -- I mean, the -- the way I'm looking at the statute, we have (A) talking about the discharge being unlawful and (B) talking about the objectives. (b)(1)(A) is specific to effluent limitations, and then there are some subsections about those. And then (C) says ""any more stringent limitation, including those necessary,"" et cetera. So, on its face, it looks like ""any more stringent limitations"" is taking us outside of effluent limitations because the ""more"" is relevant to something or relative to something. But she suggests that (a)(1) is setting effluent limitations with the best practicable control technology requirement, and the ""any more stringent limitations"" is limited to allow  --well, is allowing for effluent limitations that go beyond best control. Do you understand what I'm saying? She suggests that it's still cabined by ""effluent limitations.""</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> She's --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And I guess I'm wondering what we do with ""any more stringent limitation.""  Doesn't that defeat her argument? Or how does the government respond to that point?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Yeah, I  --I -- I think the  -- the short answer is, if Congress wanted to limit (b)(1)(C) to ""any more stringent effluent limitation,"" Congress would have put in the word ""effluent"" there. After all, ""effluent limitation"" is a statutorily defined term.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Mr. Liu, I -- I -- I think that addresses the primary argument. I haven't heard -- and I'd appreciate some response. I just want to hear what you have to say about the second  --what I understood at least to be the secondary argument, is, even if (b)(1)(C) allows other limitations, it is necessary to meet a water quality standard,  which means they can't mean the same thing that you  -- in other words, a limitation can't be the water quality standard. It has to be some restriction on discharge. That's what 1311's  all about, you said. (A) says that. The title says that. Some limitation on what they  do rather than just saying  -- creating a circle that the limitation is a water quality standard, that there -- Congress meant those two terms to do different work.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Well, there, the  -- under the statute, there is always a distinction between the limitations and the water quality standards.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yes. And I'm wondering what remains of that when you say, hypothetically, in a limitation:  Do not violate the water quality standards. Do not cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Well, as my friend acknowledged  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Is  -- is that --is that circular or is there --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- some way to break the circle?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> -- I don't think it's circular. As my friend acknowledged, the water quality themselves are not self-executing. And so it's natural to describe  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> For sure. For sure. I get that. But -- but, when you just say go forth and do good, okay, right, and  -- and -- and  -- or, you know, do not create a nuisance, or, you know, don't  -- what is it?  One of them is  -- do not cause aesthetically undesirable dislocation  -- discoloration of the ocean, that's our water quality standard. And you put that  --is that a limitation on what they do, on what they discharge, in any meaningful sense, or is that the water quality standard  itself?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I  -- I --I think it is a limitation on the discharge. It's  -- it's prohibiting an entire category of discharges, i.e., those that fit that description. And if you look at the text of the limitations themselves, they're written in terms of what the discharges can or cannot do.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And is that because</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> If that's the case, then I -- I guess I -- I'm kind of circling back  to the Chief Justice's question and, really, maybe administrative agencies generally. The point was to  --to -- to  --to give people notice ex ante of their legal obligations rathe r than rely on tort ex post, nuisance law. What -- what -- what value added is there to just an ex post tort nuisance law regime when you say:  Don't  --don't create a nuisance?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Well, as -- as I think the prior discussion also revealed, a lot of these water quality standards are not self-executing. They are not independently enforceable. And so the only way these standards are applied to a discharger like San Francisco is if we incorporate those standards in a limitation. That's where the -- we -- we need these limitations to bridge the gap between the existence of the standards, which merely specify a desired condition of the -- of the waterway, and the permittee's own responsibilities.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> No, I understand that. But  -- but --but does it add anything to an ex post tort nuisance regime?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I think it does. I mean  -- I mean, to be honest, these  -- these standards are much more specific than just a general tort regime.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Sure. I could call an expert witness up, though, and say:  Here is what constitutes a -- a nuisance. Or I can point to  --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- what EPA's water quality standards are. And I'm not sure what difference --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- as a practical matter it would make.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> -- I --I just think Congress  --I think Congress would -- the Congress of 1972 would vociferously disagree. I mean, they thought water quality standards were the linchpin on which the water of the United States would be made clean.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I -- I agree with that. Yeah.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> And they didn't think relying  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> No, I'm just asking as a practical matter, if -- if --if --if we're essentially saying don't create a nuisance and EPA sets the standard as opposed to an expert witness, what  --what value has been added?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> To be clear, it's the states that are set  --setting the standards. EPA is merely issuing permits so that the state's own view of clean water  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So then  --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> -- is achieved.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- that even begs the question further, right?  If -- if this is just a circle, the state standard is the state standard. That would be set in nuisance law too. And so what  -- what --what --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> And  --and this was basically the arguments that the proponents of the House bill made. They said:  Why do we even  need state water quality standards anymore? Let's take out of the statute 33 U.S.C. 1313. But the House bill retained the water quality standard --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Sure.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> -- provision.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Because then you're going to have an administrative agency ex ante create limitations on what you can do as a permittee in order to make sure that those water quality standards were met. But, if you take that away and there's no ex ante limitation anymore on what you can do, aren't we just sort of back to a state law nuisance regime in which the state's setting the standard of care?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I  --I don't think so. I mean, these limitations incorporate much more specific standards than just general state tort law. They say things like:  Don't cause floatable materials to be in the water. Don't cause the water to have  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That would be  -- that would be pretty good evidence of the duty in a nuisance suit, wouldn't it, the duty of care?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> It may  -- it may well be; it may not be. I think Congress -- one -- one of the problems with the prior regime wasn't that enforcement of these standards was unfair but that it was nonexistent. And so Congress actually wanted to up the ante --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> You don't think Congress wanted to  -- to ensure advance notice to permittees of their obligations under the law?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That wasn't part of the purposes?  You  --you just --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I think, if permittees think they lack -- they lack fair notice, they can bring that sort of challenge. Again  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> No, that's not my  -- Mr. Liu, my question was:  Was part of what Congress was trying to do is, as the Chief Justice indicated, try to provide some certainty on ex ante rather than just adjudicating all this ex post in nuisance cases?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Yeah, I  --I think San Francisco actually knows well what it can do to improve its own sewer system. I mean, San Francisco is an outlier here. If you look --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. Thank you. I got it.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Why -- you know,  some of these standards are not as specific: Marine communities shall not be degraded. The odor of fish shall not be altered. It's hard to know  --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I mean, to take the first example, Justice Kavanaugh --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> It's just hard  -- I'm not looking for comment on the specific example. It's just hard to know in advance, when multiple other people are also discharging into the same waters, when you're going to have crossed the line, and --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I don't think --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- and I --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> -- I don't think that concern can justify throwing all of these out across the board because --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, Justice Gorsuch's question was, I think, and the Chief Justice's, combining the water quality standards and the effluent limitations. And part of what  we have to do is figure out how they fit together in 30 -- 301 there, (b)(1)(C). And it strikes me that the way Congress ensured both more effectiveness and fair notice was to say that the end is water quality standards  --things like this, discoloration of fish, marine communities, et cetera -- but the means to the end were effluent limitations, which would both be, as the Chief Justice said, more effective, and, as Justice Gorsuch said, fair notice. And if they're not tight enough, EPA has mechanisms to tighten them up. What's wrong with that reading of the two things together?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I think it would read the statute  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> How does that hurt EPA, if you want to say that -- if  you want to respond to that?  How does that harm EPA's ability to regulate if they have to do it that way?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Oh, it's going to lead to more permit denials, more permit delays as we  wait for the information to come in. It's going to lead to less flexibility and more burdens for the dischargers. Again, look at my  --look at the context of general permits. These cover the vast majority of NPDES dischargers. They're covered by general permits. And the whole point  of the general permit is that the dischargers can get away with not providing us a lot of information. That's how you get a construction site  approved in 14 days. You take away our ability to rely on these sorts of prohibitions and we're going to need to ask for more information because it's only with that information that we're going to be  -- be able to develop more tailored limitations that assure us that water quality standards are going to be achieved.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> To what -- do we know to what degree the problem with the water quality in the affected body of water is the result of water that the City is intentionally  discharging and to what degree it is the result of these sewer overflows?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Well, to be  --I mean, I don't -- I don't think San Francisco is intentionally discharging anything or  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, the water that it treats.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Oh.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> It treats water, and some water --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> -- is  --some water flows out --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> -- when there's an overflow.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Yeah. So the permit in Attachment E contains a long list of monitoring locations, and those locations help us disaggregate what's causing what. So there are monitoring locations that -- that sample the flow out of the treatment facility, and that tells us the quality of the discharge there. And then there are monitoring locations that sample the effluent coming out  of the outflow at issue here, as well as along the shore and in the ocean.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Mr. Liu, maybe I need to start from the beginning. When you're obligated to give effluent limitations, could you give a permit that says just meet water quality controls?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Why not?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Because the statute says exhaust the technology -based effluent limitations first. And we read ""more stringent"" to mean resort to the (b)(1)(C) authority only when those technology-based effluent limitations aren't going to be enough.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You called this an individual permit versus a general permit.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I'm not sure I understand what each is. I know that this is a  permit that's issued to San Francisco --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- for its combined rainwater and -- or stormwater and  sewerage systems. So it's individual in that sense. What does that mean as opposed to a general permit?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> So you've exactly accurately described the individual permit here. A general permit, you know, the -- the prototypical one is a construction general permit, and what it says is all the people who want to engage in construction in a particular geographic area, it can be a whole state or a set of states, if you want to engage in construction, file with us a notice of intent to do that, and within 14 days, you'll have authorization to do  it. And part of that authorization  -- it's basically an agreement that once you get that authorization, you're going to abide by the terms of that general permit. And the general permit has a long list of conditions but typically includes a provision like this. And the reason why we don't  --we are unable to provide a more tailored limitation in the general permitting context is that everyone in that context agrees that the lack of information is a good thing. No constructor want  -- no -- no one engaged in construction wants to take the six months to a year to apply  for an individual permit. They want to  be able to get that authorization quickly and efficiently. But -- but the tradeoff between not having that information about how their individual site operates is that we have to rely on a more general prohibition like this.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that  --this presumes a general permit, it presumes when it's talking about a general category of industry, that  --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- certain protocols are being followed.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Right. There are some protocols in the --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Those protocols generally produce X amount or Y amount of pollutant or effluents, and we're saying you can do that, but only if you're going to go over those set limits are we going to require you to  step in and do something else, correct?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Yeah. Exactly. Those --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's what  -- that's what happens with a general permit. Now this individual permit, there was a  -- there was a concern by Justice -- the Chief Justice that this individual permit, they have many point sources of the sewerage coming in. I mean, everybody's bathroom is a point source. And they have -- yeah, that's what sewerage is, isn't it?  It's what goes into the sewer waters, okay?  And that unless they know -- unless they have effluent limitations, they won't know how to control those individual point sources or figure out how to control who's the bad actor here, what neighborhood's the bad actor. Does that matter in a situation like this?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> No, it doesn't matter in a situation --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Explain why.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Well, because the one point source that's at issue here, the one that's within the federal government's jurisdiction, is the Southwest Ocean Outfall, and that outfall  discharges into the Pacific Ocean 3.3 miles away from the coast. And there are no other dischargers  --I think my friend acknowledged this morning there are no other dischargers in the vicinity. So there's no possibility of confusing San Francisco's contribution to water  quality versus anyone else's.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So your effluent limitations are already telling it control all these things that we know you can control and control them in this way because there's better technology you could put in?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Yes. This permit exhausts as far as we can exhaust the technology -based effluent limitations.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Now what you're saying with respect to the other water standards that you're incorporating by reference is we can't tell that because  -- whatever reasons?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Yeah. What -- here's what we do know.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> We do know that San Francisco's system is resulting in 196 million  gallons of sewage poured onto San Francisco's beaches. We know that it's leading to sewer  backups into homes and businesses. We know that their infrastructure is aging and failing. We know that the discharges are leading to excessive concentrations of bacteria, copper, and other metals. So we know that the limitations that already exist in the permit are not enough to protect water quality. Then the question is, how do we fill that gap?  And we would like to fill that gap with additional effluent limitations. After all, they're more -- they're easier for us to enforce. But I think the last thing San Francisco wants us to do is to start telling them what to do without the information of how their system works. We could write into the permit reroute flows from X to Y --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That goes back to Justice Alito's point, which is you don't mind an opinion that says you can only do this if you don't have enough information to issue.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> We don't mind an opinion that says that.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan, anything further?</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Yeah. So that's true for the individualized permitholders. And then  you said for the general permits that you issue, if we took up this invitation to say that this  mechanism is just not authorized and you could not write the general permits that you write in the way that you do  --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- what would you do instead and who would suffer from that?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> All the small businesses, small farmers that rely on the general permits. These are permittees who don't have the huge companies that are able to navigate what admittedly can be a complicated individualized permit system. They rely on the simple thing of filing a form with us and being able to engage in construction 14 days later. And so saying we cannot across the board rely on these provisions is going to undermine the whole point of the general permit system and, you know, affect the economy of - - of small business owners.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And one last question is:  How long have you been doing this for, in  either the individualized context or the general context?  You know, when did this start?  Is  this a consistent practice that EPA has developed?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> So we -- in the CS -- CSO context, it certainly has existed since the CSO policy itself in 1994, which we understand as blessing this sort of condition.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So, in this particular context, almost 30 years?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> That -- that -- that's right. And  --and I guess what I would say is, again, it's our view of the statute that when we are able to avoid relying on these, we should avoid relying on these. Dischargers raise concerns, but we have concerns too. I mean, the Second Circuit case that was alleged to be in conflict with the decision below was a case brought by NRDC, and they said, well, these are hard to enforce. And so stepping into those shoes, they are, indeed, harder to enforce. In an ideal world, we would be able to get perfect information and then use that information to craft very tailored limitations that are specific to a particular site and particular discharges. It  -- it's just, in the real world, we lack that information.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Gorsuch?  Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I have a few questions. You just referenced farmers would be helped by -- the Farm Bureau Federation's in here representing 6 million farm families, along with an amicus brief that represents, as they say, nearly ever business sector across the U.S. economy. They're not happy with just leaving it up to you to represent their interests, frankly, and they say that your position will make it impossible for many permittees to protect themselves from unanticipated liability. They say that their members, including the Farm Bureau Federation, those farmers, and other permittees are left exposed to the potentially devastating and unnecessarily costly  consequences of a government enforcement action or citizen suit. So they're not  --they're not happy with ""trust us.""  Do you want to respond to the Farm  Bureau Federation argument?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Sure. I think all regulated parties would prefer to essentially have their cake and eat it too, to not have to give us the information but also not have to face these Generic Prohibitions. So I think what that -- the message of that brief is that in their ideal world, not only would they not have to give us the information, but they wouldn't have to meet the more generalized prohibitions. The statute takes that option off.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Presumably, they're aware of that and filed the amicus brief with that in mind, but, in any event, on to the next one. On the -- what you said to Justice Alito about what the opinion could say, and you said when we should avoid relying on these, when we can avoid relying on these. Would you be okay with an opinion that said we must avoid  relying on these when we can avoid relying on them?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Yeah, I want to be careful here because of the general  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Yeah, I thought you would.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text>-- because of the general permitting context.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I  -- I --I think this is a -- a balance of priorities. And in some contexts, like the general permitting context, the lack of information is an affirmative good. It is something we want -- we don't want to demand more information. And I don't think any of the dischargers actually want to have to go through the rigamarole of actually providing it. And so, when there is good reason that we are not relying  -- that we don't have the information necessary, whether it's because of resistance by a party like San Francisco or because it just doesn't make sense to demand more information, then I -- then I don't think these -- these limitations should be invalidated.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> On the criminal penalties point that Justice Barrett raised and you said that hadn't been pursued, but,  obviously, civil and citizen suits are pursued. And how much are you seeking from San Francisco?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> So we have not calculated the damages, but --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Do you know roughly?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I mean, it's -- it is --I don't have a rough even back-of-the -napkin estimate. It is --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Tens of millions? Hundreds of millions?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> It may well be tens of millions of dollars. I think what that reflects is the over decades long failure of San Francisco to update a system that it itself in its own planning documents on CAER 947 admits are aging and deteriorating.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just a quick follow -up to that. I think, when I asked you that question about criminal penalties, you cabined your answer to municipalities. Have you pursued them in the context, in this general permitting context, you know, on farmers or small businesses?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> So I don't think so. I  --I don't know for sure, but  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Is that why you cabined your answer to municipalities?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> No. I think it is -- it is only because I had an answer for municipalities. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> My answer for -- my answer in the other context is I don't know. But here's -- here's what I can tell you. We view it as exceedingly difficult to obtain a criminal conviction for violating a provision like this. That's because of the mens rea requirements in this statute, as well as the beyond -a-reasonable-doubt burden of proof. And the  -- the other thing I would say is we have no interest in pursuing criminal penalties because, when we have a situation -- a situation like this, where the welfare of a whole city is at stake, our main concern is prospective injunctive relief. We're not look  --our main focus is not to see who we can penalize and put in jail. Our main focus is how can we make this situation better going forward. So our -- our main tool  for rectifying a situation like this is to seek civil prospective injunctive relief.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I'm a little surprised by the suggestion that the goal of the statutory permitting process here was fair notice. I thought the goal was to ensure that there were clean waters in the United States and that that was not actually happening under the previous regime, and so Congress was giving the EPA additional tools to effectuate that result.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> That -- that's correct. And the problem with the pre-1972 regime was not that it was unfair. It wasn't that enforcement under the pre -- pre-1972 regime was  -- was unfair. It was that it was nonexistent.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right. So we don't have congressional findings, for example, that the statute needs to be interpreted consistent with an understanding of what would be most fair  to the polluters who are putting the sewage into the water, is that correct?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> I don't think -- well, I'll say this. I think Congress struck a balance in the statute between pursuing clean water and protecting the prerogatives of -- of polluters.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> How so?</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> If you look at 1319(d), there is a statutory penalty provision that says, when courts are crafting the correct amount of statutory penalties, courts should take into account things like the seriousness of the violation, the economic impact of the penalty on the violator.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I thought you were going to say in terms of the  --the direct statutory interpretation that you're putting forward here. I hear the balance in your statement that effluent limitations, it's clear from the statute, are the first go-to --</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- in trying to ensure that the waters are clean but that what (C) is doing is also allowing for other kinds of limitations, to potentially include generic  limitations when the effluent limitations don't suffice.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> That's what I thought your argument was.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Exactly. Congress didn't  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And that's why I think it's not circular in any sort of real sense because these other limitations are being adjudged relative to the effectiveness of the effluent limitations, so they only come in as necessary to make sure that we reach the clean water standards when the effluent limitations aren't working.</text><speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text> Exactly. And San Francisco below made the argument that, well, these  -- these limitations are not necessary because, in their view, the other limitations in the permit were already sufficient to protect water quality, and the Ninth Circuit rejected that argument, and there was no cert petition on that issue.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G.

The Court extended that reasoning to removal actions in Kirby against American Soda in 1904.

Respondents ask this Court to upset that settled interpretation, claiming that it conflicts with the text of Section 1367. But  Congress codified this Court's longstanding precedent in the text of Section 1367 itself, making clear that if the federal court has original jurisdiction, it shall continue to have supplemental jurisdiction unless Congress expressly provided otherwise. Respondents cannot cite a single decision of this Court, a single decision of a court of appeals outside of the Eighth Circuit, or a single treatise that supports their position. Respondents realize how weak their case is and instead ask the Court to decide something else, whether Grable should be overruled and, if not, whether Grable's requirements were met.

The Court should affirm its longstanding precedent and reverse the decision below. I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You mentioned Section 1367. Could you spend a few minutes on your argument as to how it disposes of -- supports your argument?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> Certainly, Your Honor. So th e text of Section 1367 states that there is supplemental jurisdiction unless Congress has expressly provided otherwise. And the text of Section 1367 does not say that when a plaintiff amends the complaint to delete the federal question, there is no longer supplemental jurisdiction. And that's exactly the interpretive approach that this Court adopted in Exxon Mobil against Allapattah, where the Court was trying to figure out what does Section 1367 say about Rule 23 and plaintiffs in class actions. And the Court looked at Section 1367, said it doesn't say anything about Rule 23, and that means that there is supplemental jurisdiction. There are also some important structural inferences here. So  --so Section 1367(c)(3) makes clear that where the district court has dismissed all claims ov er which it has original jurisdiction, it can continue to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. And that  really disposes of the argument that there has to be an ongoing federal question in the case in order for supplemental jurisdiction to be warranted. Congress didn't intend that here.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So do you think, Ms. Wellington, that  --let's say this wasn't a removal case. Let's say this was an original case and it was brought in federal court, and then the plaintiff took out the federal claim, leaving only state claims. Is there supplemental jurisdiction there?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> So this Court has treated these two situations differently, and Justice Scalia explained why in Rockwell. So there was a concern in Rockwell that when a plaintiff goes into federal court, pleads a federal question, and then immediately or subsequently drops it, that they're trying to plead their way into federal court.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So forgetting what the reason for that is, you do agree with that rule that once I file a suit in federal court as an original matter, then take out the federal claims, leaving only state law claims, there's nothing at that point for the federal court to do?  It's not a doctrine of discretion anymore. The federal court has to dismiss. Is that correct?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> That is how we have asked this Court to read Rockwell. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce brief, you know --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I just --</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- want to make sure.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> That is our view.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So, if that's the case, I don't think that your arguments from 1367 can be right because your arguments from 1367 would suggest the opposite result in the case that I gave. In other words, it's very hard  to read 1367 as imposing some kind of distinction between original cases and removed cases.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> So I agree, Your Honor, that there is no distinction in the text of 1367 itself. This Court could revisit its decision in Rockwell or limit it to the FCA context. We haven't asked the Court to do that  because we think that we win on the text here. We think, if you just --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I guess what it suggests to me, though, is, if you were willing to say, look, the Rockwell understanding of original cases is settled, we're not contesting that, then I think your arguments from 1367 go away because 1367 just doesn't create the kind of distinction that you're asking us to create. So either you lose as to removed cases too, or these arguments from the text  are just not going to get us to your result.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> So we disagree, Your Honor, with your interpretation of the text of Section 1367. We think Congress has ma de clear that there is supplemental jurisdiction unless Congress has expressly provided otherwise. It hasn't done that. And I think it's very important to consider how Congress came to write Section 1367. It was in response to Finley, where this Court took an extremely narrow view of -- pendent-claim and pendent-party jurisdiction, pendent-party jurisdiction in particular, and Congress said no, that's not what we want. We want a broader view of pendent -claim and pendent-party jurisdiction. And that's why they wrote this very broad statute here. And it would be very  strange to conclude that Congress intended to abrogate Cohill. It was decided just two years before it enacted  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's the point</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> But Cohill --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- isn't it?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Sorry. Go ahead.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's the point, isn't it?  I -- I can't get over the fact that what Congress did in 1367 was address the questions that had been in the Court. The first one was the diversity issue under St. Paul, and it agreed with the Court. It disagreed with the Court on pendent and supplemental jurisdiction, and it wrote a statute to address that. And yet it knew from Cahill that we had said that if a plaintiff dismisses an action, that potentially we go back to the original amendment, and it didn't do what it did for diversity. It wrote  it to say only when the district court dismisses the federal claims do you retain supplemental jurisdiction. That, to me, is the statute. They had all our case law. They addressed one -- one thing they agreed with. They disagreed with  another, and they disagreed with the third by not adopting what it did with diversity.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> So two responses, Your Honor. First, Section (3)  --(c)(2) does express  -- expressly address this Cohill situation. It says the district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction when the state law claim substantially predominates.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, when the district court has dismissed all claims. It doesn't say when the plaintiff has dismissed all claims.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> So I agree, that's (c)(3).</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And when the district court dismisses all federal claims, the party still has a right to appeal, correct?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> When the district court doesn't do that in a diverse action, then that  --because the claim has disappeared, there's no appeal for the defendant  --for the -- for -- for anybody, correct?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> I -- I sort of --I think, Your Honor, it depends on the case. I  think there could still be an appeal in a diversity case where the district court dismisses a claim and the plaintiff says you shouldn't have dismissed that claim.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, but that's because they're there because of the  -- the diversity provision of the statute.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just understand your argument about whether or not an amendment can affect federal question jurisdiction?  So setting aside diversity for a second, we're in federal question land. The case is filed in federal court. And the plaintiff goes through the first couple weeks and then says:  You know what?  I'm dropping my federal claims, because it originally brought  a complaint that had federal and state claims. Does that affect jurisdiction in your view or not?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> And this is a case originally brought  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Originally brought --</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> -- in federal court?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- originally brought in federal court. And the plaintiff amends and takes out the federal claims. Can the court proceed, can it decide through supplemental jurisdiction or whatnot to continue on with the case?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> So this Court suggested in Rockwell that the answer to that would be no, you would not continue in that case. And just --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay. So next question. You  --the case is brought in state court and it has federal and state claims, and before the defendant has the ability to remove, the plaintiff says:  Oops, I didn't mean to bring the federal claims, I'm dropping them. So no removal action yet or motion yet. Can it be still removed?  Is there any basis for federal jurisdiction in that situation?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> No, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> All right. So it seems to me then your argument comes down to the impact of removal because somehow, even though  in a situation in which the plaintiff amends, if it was brought originally in federal court or amends if it's brought originally in st ate court, those have an impact, you say, on federal question jurisdiction. Somehow, if the defendant removes before the plaintiff can drop the federal claims, you say no impact on federal question jurisdiction. Is that right?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Why?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> So this Court explained in St. Paul Mercury that once you've removed to federal court, there is a removal statute and the defendants have a right to remove.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But the removal statute doesn't say, as I think Justice Sotomayor was trying  to get at, anything about what happens to jurisdiction. I thought the removal statute was really just giving the defendant the ability to bring this action into federal court. It doesn't say anything about whether or not the federal court can be divested of jurisdiction once it's there. And I don't understand why the federal court can be divested of jurisdiction if it starts in federal court because the plaintiff brought it -- brought it there but can't be divested of jurisdic tion if it comes to federal court because the defendant brought it there.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> And  -- and just to be clear, the rule that we're asking for and the rule that this Court has applied for a hundred years is that it's a matter of discretion once you get to federal court on removal. It's up to the district court judge.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> On removal. But I guess why -- why does it make a difference as to how this case landed in federal court as to whether or not the federal judge can be divested of his jurisdiction?  That's what your argument seems to turn on, and I don't know why that's the case.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> And this Court addressed that in St. Paul Mercury and said that the defendant's right to remove should not be subject to the plaintiff's caprice. Congress gave defendants rights in the situation when the case gets to federal court on removal. That's different than when a case is originally  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It changes the scope of jurisdiction. The  --the removal right carries with it the ability to affect the jurisdiction of the Court, is what you're saying?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> That's what this Court has long held in cases like St. Paul Mercury. In Cohill, the Court recognized that, in Rockwell. It also recognized it in cases like Carlsbad, where this Court was talking about Cohill remands and determined that they were not mandatory, that they were a matter of discretion for the district court. And I agree, Your Honor, that in most cases, the outcome's going to be the same. When you get to federal court on a removal, in a removal case, you drop your federal claim. Immediately, most of the time you're going to go right back to state court. It's going to be the same outcome. Where it matters are cases like this one, where the case has been going on for almost two years when they amend their claims. We've  cited other cases where it's been pending in federal court for a long time and right before an adverse decision  -- so that's on page 16 of our yellow brief -- right before an adverse decision, the plaintiff amends their complaint to try to get back to state court. And in that situation, district courts have said:  Well, I'm going to balance this attempt at gamesmanship with other considerations like  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Counsel, can I interrupt you there?  I mean, St. Paul Mercury is a little bit different because it's diversity. And there's always been a problem, you know, when I used to teach diversity jurisdiction, in the amount in controversy and figuring out how to value it. And you're not capped to the damages that you claim. And so there wasn't a real change there. And, you know, Cohill, okay, it's -- it's helpful, but it's really about a different point. It's about dismissal versus remand. I think the best thing for you are all these court of appeals cases. I mean, I  -- I have a lot of trouble with the textual argument for the reasons  Justice Kagan is saying, but, I mean, it does give me some pause to say, well, all these courts of appeals have thought this was okay and there is that footnote in Rockwell, but it's not quite the old soil principle because the old soil principle requires you to be able to hang your hat on something in the statute and say this is what brought along the old soil with it. So you cite Taggart and the old soil principle, but what are you attaching it to as opposed to just some sort of, like, free-floating, everyone thought we could do this?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> So we totally agree, Your Honor, it has to be important that for decades and decades and decades every court of appeals has gone the same way. We disagree, Your Honor, that Cohill didn't address this question. It does say that when a federal law  claim is eliminated at an early stage of the litigation, the district court has a powerful reason to choose.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> To choose its dicta, its dicta. Just go with my old soil question.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> So -- so I think it is important here that Congress whole swath took parts of Gibbs and Cohill and the lower court cases prior to the enactment of the statute. So Section (a) as well as Sections (c)(2) and (3) are word for word from Gibbs. The top part of Section (c), the district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, that's drawn directly from Cohill. And (c)(1), where it talks about the claim raises a novel or complex issue of state law, that comes from 1980s court of appeals decisions that took that into account when determining whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. So this  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Your  --your briefing, obviously, suggests at least at the outset you don't think Grable has much to do with this case. And your friend on the other side obviously disagrees. But I wonder why it -- it doesn't. I mean, your reading, I think, assumes the  correctness of your position under 1367 that this complaint is one over which the district court would have original jurisdiction. And your friend, I think, has concluded that depends upon whether Grable is  correct. And so why  --why isn't it -- why doesn't it depend upon Grable?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> So this Court can decide jurisdictional issues in any order. That's what it held in Sinochem. We agree that there has to be an adjudication of the Grable question in order to get to the ultimate, you know, remedy in this case. But that's not what we're asking this Court to decide. So we don't think the Court has to decide the issue. If the Court wants to decide the issue, we think there plainly was jurisdiction based on the original complaint. The original complaint repeatedly claims that there are violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and then in paragraphs 136 and 137 of the complaint asks for an injunction requiring ongoing compliance with federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, the original complaint but not the removed complaint. In other words, not the complaint with all the federal things stripped out of it. In that situation, if that's the one you look at, then Grable is critical to your success, I think.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> Just to be clear, so the  -- the complaint at the time of removal had a federal claim, you know, that's our position. I think Your Honor is talking about supplemental jurisdiction.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> I'm sorry, yes, of course.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> And  --and this Court has long held that you don't have to have a federal question at all stages of the case in order to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. That's exactly what the Court held in Rosado, where the original federal claim became moot, and this Court said that the three-judge district court could continue to go on and decide the ancillary claims even though it didn't have original jurisdiction because you don't have to have jurisdiction over the  original federal claim through all proceedings.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> In -- in 2007, in Rockwell, in Footnote 6, the statement there resolves this case in your favor, Footnote 6. Now the other side's going to say a lot of things about Footnote 6, I think, that it's dicta, that it's mistaken, that it's w rong, that it should be ditched. You want to just take on Footnote 6? Because you win with Footnote 6, but  --</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> So we --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- is there -- you know, do we stick with that?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> We think Footnote 6 is not dicta. We think it's actually quite essential to ans wering the question that Justice Jackson was asking:  Why do we treat these two circumstances differently?  And you have to remember, prior to Rockwell, this Court had not addressed cases that were originally filed in federal court. So this Court was trying to explain we have a hundred years where we do something different in the removal context. Why are we going to do something different here?  And Justice Scalia  was explaining the different policy concerns. So we don't think that's dicta. We actually think it is essential to the reasoning in that case. And even if you think it isn't a holding, it certainly is recognizing that this Court has resolved the question in the removal context going all the way back to --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Ms. Wellington  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And why is it correct  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- why -- okay, assuming  --why is it correct?  In other words, it does seem, as Justice Kagan's questions indicate, that the Rockwell above the line and the Rockwell footnote, you would think, would come out the same way under the text of the statute. So I guess, assuming the above-the-line part is correct, why does the text of the statute support Footnote 6?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> So I think the text of the statute supports the removal jurisdiction in this case, not what happened in Rockwell. So I  -- I actually --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Right. So the  -- I think your answer is the part of Rockwell that's not in the footnote is -- is shaky.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> That's correct. And that's what the Chamber of Commerce --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> The part in the footnote, you think that's solid.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> I think that's solid because the text of Section 1367 says there is supplemental jurisdiction unless Congress has expressly provided otherwise. Section (c)(3) makes clear that you don't have to have a federal question throughout the proceedings in order for there to continue to be supplemental jurisdiction; (c)(2) expressly addresses situations like this one, where the federal law claims have fallen out. In that situation, the state law claims would substantially predominate.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I think they're going to probably say something also like it was stray comments that weren't carefully considered. And I  -- do you want to respond to the  -- I'm just previewing what they're likely to say.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> One thing I would  -- I do w ant to emphasize here is this Court was thinking about this question in Cohill. If you go to the oral argument in Cohill -- right  around minute 5, Justice Scalia is asking the same questions that we're talking about today. So the Court wasn't somehow unaware of this question.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Right. He seemed to be articulating the position in the oral argument, as I read it, that Judge Stras ultimately came to in the Eighth Circuit, but, obviously, by the time of Rockwell, Justice Scalia had not stuck with that.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> I -- I think that's right, and I think it is important that this Court was aware of the question, continued to apply its precedents, longstanding preceden t in Cohill. And I don't think you can write Cohill, which is all about this is a doctrine of discretion. I don't think you can write Cohill if you think that the court didn't have jurisdiction.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So can we go back to  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose a  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose a diversity case  --I have a diversity case, I file it in state court, it's removed to federal court, and once I'm in federal court, I join a non -diverse party. Can the federal  -- can the federal court hold onto that case?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> So, no, Your Honor, and that is addressed specifically in 1367(b). So there are circumstances, you know, for example, where there's a third -party defendant or a dispensable plaintiff under Rule 20 that, you know, the court may be able to because it's not addressed in Section  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Yeah. Well, why should there be a different rule regarding parties and claims?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> So Congress thought very hard about this. This Court has long held -- had two different lines of precedent, one for pendent-claim jurisdiction and one for pendent-party jurisdiction. It has taken a very broad view to pendent-claim jurisdiction and very narrow view to pendent-party jurisdiction. And Congress said that's not what we want. We don't want Finley. We do want some  limits. I think (b) tells you that (a) is so broadly written that if you don't have (b), that there would be concerns about diversity jurisdiction questions, Your Honor. But  Congress thought very carefully about this, and it  -- it made clear that there would continue to be supplemental jurisdiction even when the federal claims dropped out of the case.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If we thought that the Eighth Circuit's decision is right as a matter of first principle, what relevance, if any, would this line of court of appeals decisions have in our decision-making?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> I think it's very important here because Congress is codifying precedent. It's codifying these court of appeals decisions in particular in (c)(1). It's very much aware of them. And the court of appeals decisions are reflecting this Court's decision in St. Paul Mercury and Cohill and -- and now Rockwell. This is incredibly well established. So I don't think the Court should ignore that that's what the court of appeals have been doing and that they're doing it for a reason, because this is a doctrine of  discretion. It's a matter for the district court to say, what are the fairness concerns? What are the comity concerns?  What are the judicial efficiency concerns?  Maybe the district court can dispose of the state law questions really easily and the case has been going on for two years in the district court. It doesn't make sense to send that case back to state court.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, this goes back to a question that Justice Barrett asked. Usually, when we apply this old soil rule, we're talking about a term of art in the statute about which there was a body of preexisting precedent. What term of art can you point to here that supports your argument?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> Sure. So, if you look at (c), the district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, that language comes directly from Cohill. It's not in Gibbs. That's the language the Court uses twice. And so, when you're thinking about what did Congress intend to codify when it comes to whether the district court can exercise discretion, I think you have to take into account what this Court held in Cohill. I also think, Your Honor, if you think that the text doesn't say anything, this Court  has held that statutory silence implies ratification by Congress. I think you can apply  that doctrine as well to reach the answer here.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I think, if you think that the text doesn't say anything, you're left with trying to figure out what rule to use in this instance that best coheres with the whole panoply of rules that we use in other contexts. And I think that on that account, you have a tough road to hoe. You have  --you have St. Paul, and that's the amount in controversy. But, for the reasons that Justice Barrett said, the amount in controversy requirement has generally been thought of as sui generis because of the difficulty of figuring out when, how you're supposed to measure that. But, otherwise, you know, I think that the rule basically is we look to the operative complaint. We look to the original complaint when the original complaint is operative, but once the complaint has been amended, we look to the amended complaint because that's th e operative complaint, and that's why you can create diversity jurisdiction or destroy diversity jurisdiction by adding and removing parties. And it's also why you can, you know, add  -- it's also what -- what explains Rockwell. And it also explains how you can add and remove federal claims to create or  -- or get rid of federal question jurisdiction. So you're asking for a very kind of unique rule, where it's like, no, we don't look to the operative complaint; we look to this old complaint that has nothing to do with the case anymore.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> May I respond, Your Honor?</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Certainly.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> So I think it's very important here that this is a longstanding rule that really reflects the idea that Congress wanted district courts to make the decision. They wanted district courts to decide, is there gamesmanship going on here?  Is there judicial efficiency concerns?  Are there comity concerns?  And this rule that this Court is talking about would need to apply to all sorts of different circumstances, such as when the claims become moot, when  the parties settle the claim, when the plaintiff amends the complaint. And when Congress drafted Section 1367(c), what  it wanted was to give district courts discretion, and that's a reflection of decades and decades of precedent, Your Honor.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Just a brief question. You complain about the forum manipulation problems this would create. I don't see how that's a problem here. They wanted  -- they start in state court; they want to go back to state court. They're not trying to manipulate anything.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> So we think that it is forum manipulation, particularly in this case, where th ey waited almost two years to amend the complaint after they lose in the Eighth Circuit. We think that's a form of forum manipulation. We think there are much more extreme forms of forum manipulation, for example, where a plaintiff  -- you know, the district court says:  I' m about to rule against you. That's what happened in three cases on page 16 of the yellow brief. And the plaintiff says:  Great, send me back to state court. And that's a very serious form of forum manipulation. But we agree, Your Honor, in many cases, the mine-run of cases, you get to federal court, you immediately amend the complaint, the federal judge is going to send that back to state court. We're really talking about the more unique circumstances like this one where it's been going on for a long time and Congress wanted district courts to consider different considerations.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas?</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor asked you about what happens when the  --a judge dismisses some of the federal -- the federal claims, and you responded to that. And she was referring to (c)(3),  which only refers to the district court dismissing those claims. It says  -- but (c)(3) says nothing about the instance in which the party amends the complaint and  eliminates the federal claims. Would you address that?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> Certainly. That's a really important point. So that is addressed in (c)(2). So, in (c)(2), where there is no longer a federal claim, the state claim will  substantially predominate. It could also fall under (c)(4), an exceptional circumstance. I would point out, Your Honor, that (c)  is simply listing when district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. This Court in Exxon Mobil against Allapattah said really the key question is, is it in the statute?  And -- and, certainly, amendments to the complaint is not in the statute. So we think that's sufficient. But, if you want to look at the text of (c)(2), I think that also answers the question.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But  -- but do you agree that when the district court dismisses a claim, it remains in the case?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> I agree, Your Honor. But that is also true of an amended complaint. You can appeal whether a complaint was properly amended. We cited the Lucente case in the  Second Circuit that reinstates the original complaint on appeal. So, if that's the test, we think that's met.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Do we normally think of a complaint that's amended by the party to eliminate a federal claim as still having that claim?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> I -- I think that's true of all these circumstances. Where the claim becomes moot, where the parties settle, where the plaintiff voluntarily amends, where the district court dismisses, those claims, for the purposes of the party, aren't going to continue to be litigated. We think the important question here is:  When do you evaluate whether there is an original federal question in the case?  Under this Court's longstanding precedent going all the way back to St. Paul Mercury, you look at the time of removal, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> So when does an amended complaint supersede the earlier complaint?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> Your Honor, we don't think that's the right question. The question isn't whether it supersedes the original complaint. The question is:  At the time of  removal, is there an original federal question in the case?  We think that's what the phrase ""in the action"" is doing. If you look directly at Gibbs, which is where that language came from, Gibbs is saying what you need is the original claim and the supplemental claim to be in the same case. That's true regardless of whether the complaint is amended. That claim was filed in the same case.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> When many courts of appeals have considered a question and they've all decided it the same way, that certainly requires very respectful consideration. They are very likely correct. But would you also recognize that there can be circumstances in which there can be sort of a snowball effect in busy courts of appeals, particularly on certain -- a certain  category of issues so that if a court of appeals decides a question one way, then the next one just latches onto that, and pretty soon, courts of appeals confronting an issue are very likely to say:  Wow, if all these other circuits have gone this way, I'm not going to create a conflict in the circuits on this, I'm just going to go along with it. Do you think that's a  --a dynamic that can occur in courts of appeals and, if so, should we take it into account?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> I think that's possible, Your Honor, but I think this is a pretty unique case. We searched high and low, and the only two cases we found that went the other way was one district court case from 1915 and one district court case from 1940. That is overwhelming precedent in the courts of appeals. And if you look at cases like Boelens, which is a case that Justice Scalia cited in Rockwell from the Fifth Circuit, it very carefully explains the reasoning of why we treat these two circumstances differently. I think you also have to look at this Court's precedents, cases like International  College of Surgeons, Rosado, Carlsbad, Osborn against Haley. All of those cases are suggesting that this is a doctrine of discretion. So this Court has been giving the lower federal courts the same signal for many,  many decades that this is how we're going to treat this situation, and we think that's what  Congress codified in the text of Section 1367 itself.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, do you think that  --that courts of appeals read our decisions differently than we may?  I mean, you know, I'm  --I was on a court of appeals for 15 years. If I saw a strong dictum in a Supreme Court decision, I would very likely just salute and move on. But, here  -- (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> -- we have --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Not now. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> -- more of an obligation -- it depends, Justice Sotomayor -- (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> -- both when we're considering  -- you know, when we're considering what we've written  -- we know how these things are written. You know, we know how these footnotes are written. Can -- do we have liberty to read them a little bit differently?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> Of course, the Court has the liberty to read its footnotes how it would like. But I  -- but I do think it is important to keep in mind here that the question is what did Congress intend. Congress enacted this statute in reaction to the Court's very narrow view of supplemental jurisdiction. In Finley, it adopted very broad language. And I think it would be very weird to think that Congress intended to abrogate Cohill silently without saying anything about it. And I think it would also be strange to treat the situation where the plaintiff amends the complaint differently than a situation where it becomes moot, where it drops out of the case for some other reason, such as settlement. I think then you'd have to get into the  Eighth Circuit's decision between involuntary and voluntary amendments.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I go back to Congress knew when to adopt or not adopt a particular circuit court reading, and it didn't do anything with 1367, but it did do with diversity to codify that. So I don't know how much the old soil counts. But let's go back to first principles. What's the justification for this?  Plaintiff manipulation, correct?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> It's much broader than that, Your Honor. So judicial efficiency is a very important reason why Congress enacted the Gibbs principles into Section 1367. So a case may be pending for two or three years. The district court might be really familiar with it. It might be a really straightforward question of state law. In that situation --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So how doesn't Rule 15 take care of that?  It gives plaintiffs a narrow window to amend and, otherwise, it needs to seek permission. So why didn't the district court simply deny permission here?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> This case was pending almost two years before the amendment was made, but it was still an amendment as of right in this case. So you can have an amendment --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It wasn't within the window permitted by the rule.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> It was, Your Honor, because the case went up on appeal and came down. So there are situations like that.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I see.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> But there's also -- you know, leave to amend should be freely given under Rule 15. That's not really the kind of standard that takes into account these judicial efficiencies, comity  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, it certainly does. I mean, that's the entire purpose of the freedom  -- of the power and discretion to amend. So I just think, as a matter of first principles, it's -- it's really -- you have an amici, the Center for Litigation and Courts, who supports your argument but says don't rely on that. And I think they make that point for a reason. It's not your strongest point. And then I don't understand why we should change all the other rules that respect  an amended complaint as the complaint setting forth the claims in an action.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> Your Honor, we think, if you were to rule for the other side, that would be upsetting a hundred years of precedent, every single court of appeals decision. That would be changing the rules. All we ask this Court to do here is apply settled law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> We talked a lot about 1367, but I'm not  sure we paid much attention yet to 1447. And I -- I can certainly see the argument that the operative complaint should be the one at the time of removal under the old version of  1447, which suggests that a case should be remanded if it was improvidently removed. That -- that does seem to focus the Court's attention on the complaint at the time of removal. And I think a lot of the court of appeals kind of have been operating under  that kind of idea of the rule. But it's been amended, and it now reads that -- that a case should be remanded if  at any time it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, which, you know, just reading that, one might  -- and I'm sure we're going to hear this argument, so I wanted to give you a chance to respond to it before you sit down  -- that that focuses the Court's attention on  --on the then-operative complaint. Thoughts?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> Two responses, Your Honor. So I think it's important to keep in mind that the 1911 version of the statute, the predecessor of 1447 that was in effect during St. Paul Mercury, had basically the same text as it did today.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I grant  -- I grant you that. And then it went to was improvidently removed --</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- for a very long time. And now it's come back to looking more directly at the -- the then-operative complaint, doesn't it?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> So I think it is important that this Court reached the ruling that it did in St. Paul Mercury under the old text. I think that suggests that it  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I grant you that  --</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- with respect to the amount in controversy. We've been around that  --that tree a few times. So putting aside that point, have you got anything else you want to say about it?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> Certainly. So they didn't make that argument in the red brief because it doesn't answer the question. The question is whether the federal court has jurisdiction or not. We think that's answered at the time of removal. And this Court, in the Wisconsin Department of Corrections case, said that  Section 1447 was merely procedural. It did not affect the district court's jurisdiction. So I think you would have to revisit that case in  order to read 1447 here the way you suggest.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I just want to make sure on the state of the law, and maybe following up on Justice Kagan's question, because you would think when you pick this up, if you were uninitiated, that there would be a standard rule. Look at the complaint at the time of filing or removal, or look at the complaint at the time of amendment. But at least as I looked at everything, it's just a mess, right?  There's just boxes everywhere where, you know, in the diversity context, destroying diversity almost always compels dismissal or a remand, but reducing the amount in controversy or changing citizenship of a party almost never does. Right?  Is that correct?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> That's correct, Your Honor. There --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Like Morgan's Heirs and St. Paul Mercury on the one hand and  Owen Equipment on the other, there's no logic connecting those things at least as I see it.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> I --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> They were just rules out there without connective logic. There  might be  --each box has its own little idiosyncratic policy considerations, but there's no connective rule at least as I read it. Correct me if I'm wrong.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> I think you're right.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Or the other side can correct me if I'm wrong too. Yeah.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> I think you're right, Your Honor, that there are different rules that apply in different circumstances, that they have different policy concerns or longstanding prudential concerns and that this Court shouldn't go around disrupting those rules. There are lots of different rules that apply with respect to adding diverse parties. Sometimes you can do that. Sometimes you can't. You can add a non-diverse successor in interest, for example. So there's lots of different  circumstances. And we simply ask the Court to apply settled law. We don't think the Court has  to come up with a unifying theory for all these different areas of the law. Congress acted with  an important reason here with respect to supplemental jurisdiction. It wanted to protect the defendant's right to remove. And I think  that's why you see this broad text here. And as well as judicial efficiency. So --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And by ""settled law,"" you mean Footnote 6, you mean Cohill?  Or what are you referring to there?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> So you're right, Your Honor. So St. Paul Mercury, Cohill, and Rockwell. There are also cases like Carlsbad, where this Court expressly asked, is a Cohill remand -- that's the phrase the Court used -- is a Cohill remand discretionary?  I don't think this Court could answer the question yes without having, again, decided this question. There are other cases like International College of Surgeons and Rosado that, again, emphasize that this is a discretionary question. And I don't think this Court should just depart from all of that precedent here. I don't think there's a good reason to. And this Court should  --this is a statutory question. Stare decisis carries enhanced force in the statutory context, and that's why we've asked the Court to continue to apply settled law.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?  Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Just a couple of quick points. So you keep talking about protecting the defendant's prerogative of removal. But I thought there was also sort of basic principles about the plaintiff's prerogative to bring a case in state or federal court to be the master of their claims. And so what I don't understand is why the plaintiff has to be stuck with the jurisdictional consequences of claims they are no longer bringing?  They've given up their ability to seek relief on the federal claims, and so it just seems odd to me, especially when our case law kind of generally links jurisdiction with the claim, you have to have jurisdiction for every claim, those two concepts run together, and yet somehow they can drop  claims and still be, in your view, subject to the jurisdictional consequences of that. That just seems discordant to me, so can you speak a little bit about that?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> It's a really important question, Your Honor, because what Congress was trying to do is take into account the right of plaintiffs to be the master of their complaint but also the right of defendants to remove. And that's exactly what investing discretion --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But Justice Gorsuch points to statutes that talk about remand. So, even though the defendant has exercised its right of removal, there are circumstances in which that right is not given precedence. The case goes back to state court, right?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> That's exactly right. It's up to the district court to decide. And we think in the mine run of cases where you amend the complaint right after you remove, there's removal to federal court, that's going to go back to state court. What we're really talking about here are more unusual cases where it's been going on for a long time. There may be particular concerns  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask you about the text, moving quickly because I'm  mindful of the time. I don't understand how the question could possibly be whether or not there is original jurisdiction at the time of removal. Of course, there is. That's why the case gets to be removed. I mean, there's no question there that does any work because you only get to remove it if there's original jurisdiction. So isn't the question really what happens when, after we've identified original jurisdiction and it's removed, the claims over which there were original jurisdiction drop out? Can supplemental jurisdiction be exercised when those original jurisdiction claims are no longer there?  When we look at the text of 1367, I don't understand your argument that supplemental jurisdiction arises in that situation because (a)  says, in any civil action of which district courts have original jurisdiction, the district court shall have supplemental jurisdiction. But, in my scenario, original jurisdiction is gone. So how can you have  supplemental jurisdiction in a situation like this?</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> I think it's really important to go back to the first principles that this Court was applying in Cohill. It was  looking at St. P aul Mercury, which holds that you have original jurisdiction at a particular time. And so, once you get original jurisdiction, you continue to have supplemental jurisdiction. That's what the Court held in Rosado. There, the original claim became moot and  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So wouldn't we expect it to say in which the district court had original  --or ever had original jurisdiction? It seems to be in the present tense saying that you have to have original jurisdiction in order to exercise supplemental.</text><speaker>Katherine B. Wellington</speaker><text> And I think that's because you have decades and decades of precedent saying that in a removal context, you look at whether there's jurisdiction at the time of removal. At that time, the district court  has original jurisdiction, and then the question is, will it continue to have supplemental jurisdiction?  The text here is framed in a forward-looking future tense, and we think ""shall have"" does cover the situation where there's ongoing supplemental jurisdiction.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Mr. Keller.</text>","<speaker>Ashley C.

It's the most faithful to the text, it avoids serious constitutional problems, and it will save decades of pointless litigation over jurisdiction.

Keller</speaker><text> Of course, Your Honor. So I think the plain text controls. We agree about that. The present  tense verbs, I think, are intended to indicate that there is jurisdiction presently. We focused on the word ""have"" with the colloquy with Justice -- Justice Jackson. I would also focus on the word ""are.""  There has to be a relationship between the other claims, the state law claims that are related to claims in the action, the federal -- federal claims that are within the Court's original jurisdiction. If we amend out those federal claims, they're no longer in the action. There's no relationship. And so there's no supplemental jurisdiction. That's 1367(a). That's the requirement to establish supplemental  jurisdiction. You don't get to the exceptions in (b) or (c) unless you establish jurisdiction under (a).</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I think not logic but experience, you lose, Mr. Keller, because the experience cuts the other way. I mean, just the -- this has all -- until the Eighth Circuit came along, the position of the Petitioners has always been understood, assumed. Every -- everybody thought that that was the rule. And it was a rule which really has no adverse consequences because everybody remands these cases anyway. In 99 percent of the cases, these -- these  --you know, there's a remand. So, like, what harm is this rule doing?  And this rule has existed in every single circuit court for lo these many years.</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> Yeah, so I respectfully disagree. The master principle that I think  governs in every context, except the amount in controversy, is that the amended complaint controls. If you amend a complaint in state  court to add a federal claim --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So I basically agree with you. I mean, I basically agree with you on that and not with Justice Kavanaugh. Justice  Kavanaugh says it's all arbitrary. I don't think it's arbitrary. I think some of the cases that he was talking about is when facts in the world change, but when we're not talking about facts in the world, when we're talking about allegations, I think that the structure is the way you describe it, that we look to the operative complaint, the amended complaint, except in the amount in controversy area, where there are sort of special considerations. But -- so I -- I kind of agree with you that if we were creating a system where all the rules cohered, yours is the better rule. But  -- but I think on the other side of the table is, look, we have this anomalous rule, but this anomalous rule has been accepted b y everybody for many, many years, and it does no  harm anyway since most of these cases are remanded back to state court where they belong.</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> Yeah, a couple of responses to that, Justice Kagan. First of all, I don't think that we, meaning this Court, has ever embraced that rule. It's true that the lower courts deserve respectful consideration, but a lot of these  cases predate binding statutory text, so I'm not sure that that's dispositive. Also, I would respectfully submit that you're the supervisory Court that's most important in our Article III system. And when you're hearing a question for the first time, you ought to adjudicate it correctly, notwithstanding the respectful consideration that you would give to the lower courts. And if you've determined, as it sounds like you have, that from first principles I'm right, the fact that lower courts that obviously can't bind this one got it wrong I don't think is a reason to just say let's go along to get along. And I also think there --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Counsel, you're --</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> -- are --oh, I beg your pardon.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- you're suggesting that it's kind of the -- the first time the  Court's considered the question. I understand that. But you do have Cohill and the Rockhill -- Rockwell footnote to deal with, and I ha ven't heard a word about those yet.</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> Well, here it comes, Justice Gorsuch. As Justice -- (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I can't wait. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> As -- as Justice Kavanaugh previewed, I don't think that Footnote 6 in Rockwell is anywhere near the ratio decidendi of the opinion. Justice Scalia was as capable as anyone of making a stray remark. He didn't even consider the statutory text of 1367, which both my friend and I agree is  dispositive. And the easiest way to tell that it's dicta is, if you cover up Footnote 6, would it make any difference for the adjudication of the rights and responsibilities of the parties? Obviously not. Rockwell would have come out the exact same way and the exact same outcome and judgment would have occurred. So, for --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> We have a lot of things in opinions that you can make that same comment about that we follow, just for the -- just to put that out there. Sorry to interrupt.</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> I -- and I --and I agree with you, Justice Kavanaugh. The fact that it's  dicta doesn't mean that you toss it out the window. I think what it means is you take it for what  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> No, that we don't even treat it as dicta, but keep going.</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> Well, it's up to you to decide whether or not you would treat it as dicta here. I think it's pretty ill-considered and it doesn't get into the fact that it creates the inconsistency that we've been talking about, where the exact same text means one thing for an original case and something else for a removed case. I don't think that's the sort of thing that Justice Scalia would have countenanced given his commitment to textualism.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Counsel, your friend on the other side -- were you finished?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah. Thank you.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Your friend on the other side says that this would wreak havoc with the Class Action Fairness Act and remove cases. Do you want to address that?</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> I'm not sure that I understand that point, Your Honor. I don't see  why it would wreak any havoc. CAFA makes it a lot easier to remove cases into federal court. So, in the mine-run case, they're going to have no difficulty. The difficulty that they face here is that you have no diversity of any kind. CAFA obviously eliminates complete diversity and goes to minimal diversity as the standard, but that's a relatively unusual circumstance. Oftentimes, plaintiffs are trying to seek a nationwide class or something broader. So I don't think it's going to wreak havoc because the incentives are still going to be there when there's widespread harm for plaintiffs to pursue classes that include citizens from many different states.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Counsel, we have had cases where we came out the other way than every court of appeals had come out, right?</text><speaker>Ashley C.

I just  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Gosh, I'm not sure which way that cuts. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> I'm not sure that's true. I just have it in the back of my mind, but -- okay.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Just go back to the state of the law. I certainly didn't use the word ""arbitrary.""  It's just that each bucket has developed  based on its own idiosyncratic considerations. And you can't  necessarily get a through line of look at the time of filing or the time of amendment at least as I look at them. And it's beyond just amount in controversy. It's change in citizenship as well. I just want to  --do you agree with that on the change in citizenship?</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> I agree, obviously, that the change in citizenship rule has a long pedigree. It goes back to 1824. I don't agree that that's about whic h complaint controls. That's about real-world facts.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> So, if you want to amend a complaint to say:  I made a mistake, I said that I was from Florida and the defendant was from Illinois, but I realized that the defendant actually moved to Florida two years ago, so we're both from Florida, the amended complaint would control there.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Right. And then, on  Footnote 6, let me just -- I know you're going to disagree that it controls. If  --if it does control, I mean, if it is binding, it goes  against you in this case, correct?</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> Of course. And then I win under Grable or Merrell Dow.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And, you know, I just wonder, so you look at Footnote 6. To me, Footnote 6 is like somebody said:  Hey, but how about Cohill?  And then they said:  Oh, yeah, Cohill, so we have to put in Footnote 6. And  -- and so the fact that Footnote 6 is there suggests a certain kind of reading of Cohill. And, you know, what Cohill was about that it  -- was this question of do you have to dismiss a case or can you remand the case back to the state court?  But Cohill's logic does cut against you, I think, fairly heavily here because, as I read, Cohill what it does is say something like this:  You know, the supplemental  jurisdiction business, ever since Gibbs, we've understood it as a completely discretionary area of jurisdiction. You can keep the case. You can dismiss the case. If you can keep the case  and you can dismiss the case, surely you should be able to remand the case as well. And that's the essential logic of Cohill. It's like everything is discretionary  in this area, why shouldn't this be too?  But that logic really does cut against you because it suggests that everything is discretionary in this area, including keeping the case.</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> Yeah, a couple of responses to that, Justice Kagan. Whatever amount of discretion I think existed in the Cohill era I don't think can continue through binding statutory text. So we're no longer operating in a common law realm. We're operating in a realm where Congress chose to act. We can debate whether Congress chose to codify whatever the common law rules were hook, line, and sinker. I would suggest from -- Allapattah that it codified binding statutory text, and we should follow the text. So I don't think we can just go with free-wheeling old principles now that Congress</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, how about if I think that the text doesn't really help either of you?  The -- you know, you're saying text; you're saying text, and, in fact, neither of you really has a very strong argument about text and we have to decide this case on other grounds.</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> So the other grounds, I think, would be the master pri nciple that we talked about that the operative complaint almost always controls. The only context that I'm aware of where it doesn't control is the amount in controversy. That, by the way, was also codified through binding text. That's 1446. I agree that it goes back longer to cases like St. Paul Mercury. As an aside, I actually think that's a completely defensible interpretation of the old statutory text precisely because Congress understands it doesn't want to blur the line between jurisdictional facts and the merits. We don't want to create the Judge Posner problem where a plaintiff comes into court and loses or wins an amount that's less  than the amount in controversy and now we have to  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> -- remand for lack of jurisdiction.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Do I understand your -- what you just said to mean that you would win this case even if 1367 had never been enacted?</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> I think that I would win this case if 1367 hadn't been enacted and we were still in a more common law regime and this issue were squarely presented to the Court for the first time. Cohill had this issue obliquely presented. Yes, there was an amended complaint. But the party presentation rule should matter. No one made that fact relevant for the Court's consideration. You could have considered it sua sponte because it went to jurisdiction, but no one did. And this Court has pointed out before that drive -by jurisdictional rulings don't have any precedential effect. The reason you had to say that is sometimes, even though you would like to avoid it, you issue drive-by jurisdictional rulings.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Why  --why -- why  -- why would we say Cohill addressed this?  As I understand it, in  -- the question there was whether to remand or dismiss, and this -- this issue wasn't presented to the Court at all.</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> I completely agree with it. It was not presented to the Court. The facts of Cohill, though, I have to say in the -- in the spirit of candor was that there was an amended complaint and it dropped the federal claim, and then there was the question of whether there is discretion to remand versus just discretion to dismiss for lack of continuing jurisdiction.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And do you have any way to rationalize St. Paul Mercury other than it's been codified now?</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> No, I do think that I can rationalize St. Paul Mercury. As I was saying just a moment ago, I do think that the amount in controversy, even before Congress said in 1446 we have to look to the initial pleading, going back to cases like St. Paul Mercury, it is reasonable to read  -- read the words ""amount in controversy"" to mean theoretically possible to be recovered. It doesn't matter what happens after you file your lawsuit. And so, if the plaintiff pleads in an initial complaint, consistent with Rule 11 or  whatever the equivalent was in 1938, I'm above the jurisdictional amount in controversy, that's showing that it's theoretically possible to recover that amount in good faith, and that's good enough for the statutory jurisdictional requirement that Congress added onto Article III.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Mr. Keller, in thinking about -- you know, Justice Kavanaugh was talking about the different boxes and some of the inconsistencies. One way I've been thinking about this is I think it's been true for a very long time, back to Strawbridge versus Curtiss and the complete diversity requirement, you know, talking about Mottley and the well-pleaded complaint rule, that the Court for a very long time exercised a pretty free hand in interpreting 13-1 and --1331 and 1332. That language is identical to Article III, but yet the Court interpreted it to mean something different. And I think that in the Gibbs regime pre -1367, the Court was exercising a pretty free hand in -- in articulating the  contours of pendent jurisdiction and ancillary jurisdiction before Congress controlled it. Can you think  -- I mean, I think a lot of this case seems to kind of come down to is that just the way we've been treating jurisdictional statutes and do we keep it up with 1367, or in 1367 because, in Finley, the Court kind of said no, look, Congress, there need to be clear jurisdictional rules, expressly invited Congress to address it, which Congress did. Would you say, do you think it's fair to say, or can you think of a counter-example that in 1367, when it comes to supplemental jurisdiction, the Court has tightened its belt and isn't being as free-wheeling, or can you think of other examples where the Court, this Court, has done kind of what the court of appeals seemed to have continued to do in 1367, which is maybe make a little bit more jurisdictional policy than was set out in the text?</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> Yeah, an important question, Justice Barrett. I think I would  describe the history a little differently. I wouldn't describe it as free-wheeling. I would say it all points in one direction. The Court construed jurisdictional statutes more narrowly than Article III. So that's certainly true with  Strawbridge versus Curtiss. We know that there's not a complete diversity requirement because of CAFA. It's the same thing with 1331. Justice Thomas noted this in Grable. From the very beginning of the Jurisdiction and Removal Act of 1875, this Court almost immediately construed the words ""arising under"" to be not coextensive with Article III.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Gibbs is a counter-example for you, though.</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> Gibbs is a counter-example, and the Court in Finley, I think, gently criticized Gibbs for operating without a statute. It did invite Congress to act. Congress has now acted, and so, having taken up this Court's invitation to supply positive law codifying this entire area, I think you should stick to your normal statutory interpretation principles. And if you want to  put a thumb on the scale, it should be against jurisdiction, consistent with tradition.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Setting aside 1367, going back to Justice Alito's question, I'm wondering whether the sort of core principles  basis for your position is basically the plaintiff is the master of the complaint. They get to plead the claims. For federal question jurisdiction, the claims matter. That is, jurisdiction is based on the claims that the plaintiff pleads. If the claims are amended, the federal court can be divested of jurisdiction, and removal really has no bearing on the scope of jurisdiction or at least that's never been established, that  -- that how it comes to federal court matters with respect to an amended complaint. Is that roughly where you're coming from with the principles that would underlie this, even setting aside the statute?</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> Yes, that syllogism is perfect. If there  are no further questions or -- I'm happy to go to seriatim.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Thomas?  Justice Alito? Justice Kavanaugh? Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text> Thank you, Your Honor.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Rebuttal?</text>"
10,2024.23-583 -t01,"<speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  In Section 1154(c), Congress unequivocally stated that no petition shall be approved if the beneficiary engaged in a sham marriage. In context, that requirement applies not just to the day of approval but to the next day as well. In other words, the petition cannot remain approved if the agency reconsiders its initial decision and concludes that there was a sham marriage. That's because an approved visa petition confers no substantive benefits. It is simply a piece of paper signifying that a beneficiary is eligible to apply for a green card. If Congress believed you shouldn't get that piece of paper saying that you're eligible when you've been in a sham marriage, then -- then the agency has to take it away when it determines that you're not, in fact, eligible. That resolves this case. Because the revocation here was non-discretionary, it is reviewable. The government seeks to shield  itself from judicial review by claiming it has discretion to not revoke the petition even after a sham -marriage finding. Yet it identifies no circumstance in which it has ever or would ever exercise that purported discretion. Nor does it explain what purpose such discretion could serve if, as the government appears to believe, it's not actually allowed to give the beneficiary a green card. The discretion appears to simply be the discretion to allow a person to hold on to a now meaningless piece of paper that has been drained of all of its value. That cannot be the kind  of discretion that Congress sought to protect. The government's view also layers one anomaly on top of another. Most significantly, it creates a disparity in review between an initial decision and a reconsideration of that same decision based on the same criteria. And the government concedes that a person could obtain review if they filed a new -- a new petition and had it denied. But that gives the game away. That is the exact same non-discretionary decision  that the government claims needs to be shielded from review. The only difference is years of  additional delay where families and children live under constant fear that they will be separated. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>John G.

That is the exact same non-discretionary decision  that the government claims needs to be shielded from review. The only difference is years of  additional delay where families and children live under constant fear that they will be separated. I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Does the government always revoke a decision when it discovers, later discovers, a sham marriage?</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Yes. We've identified no case and the government has identified no case where the government has ever exercised any purported discretion to not revoke. So what the government does in these situations is, when they discover that there has been a sham marriage, they -- as far as we can tell, their uniform practice is to revoke. And if you look at the actual decisions, the decisions all read like decisions that are non-discretionary. The decision to revoke looks exactly like the decision to deny. They apply the same criteria. They use the same language. No one mentions discretion. That's a  stark contrast to the kinds of decisions on adjustment of status, for example, where you see people asking the agency, could you exe rcise discretion?  The agency says we're not going to exercise discretion for these reasons. We have not identified a single BIA opinion where the  -- the agency has ever talked about the possibility of exercising discretion in this situation. So it is treated as automatic in practice.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Are there revocations that you think are not reviewable?</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Yes, absolutely. I think any revocation  --</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> What  --what would -- what would that look like?</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> So, for example, if  -- if the agency, you know, determines that someone is eligible and then says later on  -- finds out, you know, this person, you know, may be affiliated with a terrorist organization or something like that, you know, we're going to revoke their petition. We don't want them to even apply for a green card. The agency has a lot of discretion. There's a big universe of cases where the agency  absolutely can exercise discretion to come up with additional reasons. But that's what Section 1155 is. It's, once you've met your eligibility criteria, the agency has discretion  to come up with more reasons. So it's a way of saying the agency has flexibility to deny more petitions. What it's not is -- you know, gives the agency the flexibility to ignore the mandatory initial eligibility criteria and allow -- I mean, what they're claiming is allow more petitions through into the system that otherwise should have been revoked if the agency had made a mistake.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> So you're saying it has to be for a reason other than the initial reason?</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Right. It can't just be a reconsideration. It can't be we made a mistake and so, you know, now we have the discretion to not revoke it.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> So what do you  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well  --</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> -- rely on for that?</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> And -- and we rely on 1154(c), and that language says no petition shall be approved. And we think in context --</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But that's approval. We're talking about revocation.</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Right. I think that's the question. You know, does that language -- does it end on the day of approval, or does it create continuing obligations that the petition can't maintain the status of being approved after the first day?  And so -- and I think, in context, it does mean the latter thing. And just to give you an example that might help, we have a few examples, but one example is no article shall be approved for publication if there is evidence of plagiarism. I think everyone would understand that if you approve the article for publication and then the next day you find out that there is plagiarism, it would be very strange to say: Well, the rule just says it shouldn't be approved for publication. It's already been approved for publication, so we'r e just going to let it go ahead and get published. You would -- you would say:  Well, we have to withdraw. We can't publish. And the reason I think that example is helpful is the green -- the -- the --the visa petition is just a document saying you're eligible. So it's just a document saying you're approved for publication. It's not the  publication itself. That's getting the green card. And so, in a situation where, in between those two times, approval of the petition and then going to the agency and getting the green card, the agency figures out it's made a mistake, it's very strange to say, well, the agency can just pretend it hasn't. It can just let you have the document, and it can go ahead and say you are, in fact, eligible for a green card.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counsel  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, but that's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Sorry.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> I mean, I get -- the government's position as far as I can tell is that you -- you just won't take yes for an answer. You want there to be review rather  than review after revocation. And they're saying you can get that. Just apply again, and you'll get exactly what you would have -- you think you're entitled to, which is judicial review of the decision. What -- what more can -- what more do you want?</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Well, I mean, I think that underscores what's so senseless about the government's position. From our perspective, the harm is that it would be years of additional delay. We did refile. It's been two years of delay now.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, they can't give you the years  --they can't give you the years back, but you're asking for a particular procedure and a particular level of judicial review. That's your request for relief. that  --And they're saying you can get that. </text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> You -- you can get</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Yeah, they should have given you -- I mean, yeah, they made a mistake in the first place, but they're letting you  go ahead and do what you say you should have  -- they should have done.</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Well, but at a much greater cost. They're saying you have to go back, file another  petition, wait years for that to be adjudicated. And for us, for an immediate  family petition, that's harmful, but for other kinds of petitions, it -- it could be really devastating because, for other kinds of petitions --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, we'll worry about the other kinds of petitions in a case where they're raised. It seems to me that yours is pretty straightforward. And I'm sure -- I'm sure the government is sorry for the years, but it seems to me that that's the type of relief you would get. The relief is not going to be that they approve your application, right?</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> No, the relief is to get judicial review. But --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> And  -- </text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> --for someone  -- but, for example, for someone who is in a different -- like an employment-based or other kind of family eligibility category, which this -- the revocation rule governs every single kind of revocation, those people lose their priority date. And if you lose your priority date, as this Court noted in Tesoro, that could be 10 years, 15 years, because the  --the -- the number of green cards that are out  there, the number of available green cards, is far smaller than the number of applicants. So there are millions pending --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> So that's another  -- another case that is not like yours, right?</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Well, I mean, I think that the rule on the revocation absolutely governs, and the government, I think, would accept, absolutely governs that situation as well. And, in our situation, we still lose two years. And I think -- but I think the key point here is, if that's all true, why does the government care about barring judicial review? They think this exact decision was reviewable yesterday when it was a denial. They think it's  going to be reviewable tomorrow if we go through the process of refiling. The only difference is clients like mine have to live for years still not knowing whether their family is going to be separated. And that just shows there is no discretion here  to protect. There is no reason to deny review of this exact decision.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, isn't that  --isn't that the argument you're going to make on the merits when you -- if you do reapply?</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> I mean, if we do reapply, I think the government's position is they decided we're in a sham marriage and they're going to deny. And, great, once you've gone through that arduous process --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> At that point, you get judicial --</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> -- you'll get review.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Yeah. </text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Well, and that just shows that why are they -- you know, there is -- I  -- the why question, I think, just jumps off the page here on the government's side. Why is the government denying judicial review?  What  possible reason is there to deny judicial review of a revocation if they believe that this decision is non-discretionary and is, in fact, the kind of thing that should easily be subject to judicial review?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Well, maybe they  -- maybe they do think it's discretionary and they just happen to exercise their discretion consistently, which is what I think that we would want. I mean, the strange thing about your argument to me is that it seem s as though saying that the agency has discretion not to revoke would generally be more favorable to people who are applying, right, that the agency makes a mistake in the first instance, it does not follow whatever the mandatory criteria are for approval, and it gives the person approval, and then they discover that that was a mistake. I would think that the argument made from people who are applying would be you have discretion to -- to keep the approval in place. You don't have to revoke it. You know, it was your mistake. We've gotten past that stage, so let me just keep going. The implications of your argument is that, no, if they make a mistake, then they actually have to revoke their approval and that that's non -discretionary. And that just seems odd to me coming from your side of this argument.</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Right. But it's no surprise that, you know, all the amici from various organizations and immigration attorneys that work in this field, they've all lined up on our side because, in reality, the government does not believe it has any discretion. It's never exercised any discretion. And no one has even made this request really to the government because it doesn't exercise any discretion. And I think maybe the more important point is, as I understand the government's view of what discretion it has to exercise, it is just the discretion to not revoke. I think the government thinks it still has to deny your green card, and so I think that's probably why</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah, but that's at later stages. I mean, they have these sort of check-in points at later stages. As you articulated, this is just the beginning of a  long process toward get -- getting you a green card. And if things come up in that process -- whether they overlap with previous stages or not seems to be neither here or there. The  government continues on and allows you to continue on, and if those same factors come up, that could be a reason to deny the green card. It's just odd, I think, to suggest that when we get to this stage, you -- you clear the approval hurdle, which, in general, I think, is positive from the standpoint of the person who is applying, to  --to suggest that the government has to keep going back and deciding whether or not it was right to give you approval to begin with seems to me to be less favorable from your perspective.</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> But it's not because, in practice, the government always denies -- I think understands itself in every BIA decision</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Isn't that better than arbitrarily going back and forth?  I mean, the  -- the -- if the government is consistent in its practices with respect to how it exercises its discretion, isn't that what one would want  in a rule of law kind of scenario?</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> It's consistent because  -- well, I don't think in a situation where there's discretion. I think if  --I think it would be problematic if you have -- you know, you protect judicial review because there's discretion for the government. The government never exercises discretion, doesn't conceive of itself as really being capable of exercising discretion, and the result of that, of course, is no one gets judicial review.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Except for the --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Well, what if it did?  Oh, sorry.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> What if it did? What if it started exercising discretion?  Would your case go away?  Or what if it had been conducting itself the way Justice Jackson is positing, you know, sometimes revoking it, sometimes not?  Then do you have no case? </text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Well, I mean, I t hink as long as what they would be able to do then is to allow someone to be eligible for the green card. I think what they're saying is we believe that we can just still deny green cards. And we don't believe that the government can do that because the only place where this criteria exists, 1154(c), is at the petition approval stage. So what the -- what -- what  --what the  -- what a valid petition says, what a non-revoked petition says is it says you are eligible for a green card. You have not engaged in a sham marriage. That's something you've not done. That's what it's signifying to the agency. So then I think, if the agency says, well, you have that, so you've not engaged in a sham marriage, even though it separately found that you have, we're going to exercise our discretion to allow you to go ahead into the process and  get a green card, that would be a meaningful kind of discretion. But I don't think that's what the government is suggesting as the kind of discretion it has. I think it's saying we -- we -- we have a sham-marriage finding. We're independently allowed to say we're going to stop your green card. We're not allowed to say -- we have to  -- we have to stop you having a green card as a result of that, but what you're allowed to do is hang on to this piece of  paper, and this piece of paper now means nothing because, even though the only significance of  the piece of paper is I'm eligible for a green card, we actually don't think you're eligible for a green card.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> What if they don't give a reason for revoking it?  Do they have to?</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> They have to give --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> I mean, how are we supposed to know if it was because they concluded it actually was a sham marriage?</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Right. They have to give a reason under their regulations. That's at 8 C.F.R. 205(2)(c). So it would be a violation of their own procedures if they didn't give a reason. I think, you know, if they abolished all of their own procedures and BIA review, I think we would still have an argument that that was arbitrary and capricious.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> But we're interpreting the statute. I mean, the statute  doesn't itself require a reason, right?</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> The -- the statute doesn't require a reason, but I think it would  be very hard for the government to avoid giving a reason, and it might well be arbitrary and capricious if the agency's path can't be discerned. And I'll also say that the government has made this type of argument in other cases. This Court has consistently rejected it. To  -- to quote the language in this Court's Hawks' decision, ""such a count-your-blessings argument is not an adequate rejoinder to the assertion of a right to judicial review under the APA.""</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counsel, I  -- I -- you've conceded that 1155 doesn't say mandatorily you have to revoke, correct?</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So you're asking us to say because of, as a matter of practice, this is what they believe they must do. But I don't even know if the agency has to bother, meaning, if you posited that if they -- they couldn't use the sham marriage later, but I don't know why not. If the petition wasn't  revoked, they could just simply deny you a visa or an adjustment of status because you're under -- you're not admissible under 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) because of the fraud bar.</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> But the fraud bar is waiveable. You know, that --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well, you think the  -- the fact that they didn't revoke makes it waiveable?  They could -- that makes no sense to me.</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Right. I  -- I think and what the lower courts have held is that 1154(c) is a non -waiveable perpetual restriction on someone who has been found to be in a sham marriage, i.e., in that situation, the agency just loses -- and one of the very few restrictions in the immigration code that looks like this --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right. So what do you do with 11 --</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> -- loses all discretion.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- what do you do with 1182(i), which allows the attorney general to waive the fraud bar if the applicant is the spouse of a U.S. citizen and refusing admission would result in extreme hardship to the citizen?  It seems to me that if the government chose -- it just hasn't, but that doesn't mean much to me. If it chose, if someone was here,  let's say, 50 years, I suspect there's going to be a lot of movement for the government not to revoke on the basis of sham  marriage. </text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> So the 50-year thing, you know, wouldn't happen because that -- this is just that period of time between the petition and getting  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And when the -- </text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Right. So, you know, there's obviously 1256 and there's all kinds of rescission provisions.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But go ahead to my 1182.</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Right. I mean, the lower courts have held -- I think it's been the government consistent position that 1154(c) is non-waiveable, as in it doesn't fall under that provision. Now they can obviously deny on the basis of fraud if they want, but they're not obligated to. And our understanding or our argument is that 1154(c) --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So, if they're not obligated to, they can't waive either?  Well, your  -- </text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Right. They  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- your opposing counsel can answer my question. That's fine.</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Right. And our position is 1154(c), that what Congress intended was that is a restriction that is not  --that takes away discretion from the government, and they accept that at the petition approval stage. They can't say:  Well, there's a lot of equities here, we're going to --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well, that's because the law requires them not to give it.</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Exactly. And so then that  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that says nothing about what happens later. </text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> And that  -- but I think that's the nub of the dispute. I mean, I think there's a lot of common ground here. And,  really, the nub of the dispute is, does 1154(c) apply just on the day of approval, or does it extend to the day after?  And that's why I think the example I gave is helpful. There are  --there are lots of ordinary English contexts where you can -- you know, the -- the -- an obligation on the day of approval is logically understood --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right, counsel. MR. DEGER SEN:  -- to apply to the next day.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Why does it matter whether the government, in fact, has been exercising discretion?  1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) strips jurisdicti on over decisions Congress specified to be in the agency's discretionary authority. It uses the term ""authority.""  So why does practice matter? </text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Oh, I think practice only matters as it informs what the statute requires. And we think that 1154(c) makes this non-discretionary in this situation, i.e., because the agency has to revoke when it has found a sham marriage. It's non-discretionary and falls outside of the relief bar.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, if you concede that interpretation of the provision that I just mentioned, then what do you do with a very straightforward statutory argument, if you put  that together with 1255, you're in a lot of trouble?</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> With 1155?  Well, no, I  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> 1155, yes. </text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> No, I mean, I -- I think 1155 gives the government a measure of discretion to come up with additional reasons to revoke, but it doesn't mean that they are allowed to ignore the mandatory criteria. It doesn't speak to the question of when they have to revoke. And the government accepts this, by the way, because -- you know, they accept that 1154(h) decisions are reviewable because, of course, if you have  --you know, X statute says you have discretion to do all of these things, and then another statute says but you don't have discretion to do this, then, clearly, that second statute means you don't have discretion to do that second thing. And so the fact that 1155 gives a measure of discretion doesn't mean that every single revocation is discretionary. The question is, is there a separate statutory  restriction that prohibits the government from exercising discretion in this situation?  And  that's why I think it all comes back to our interpretation of 1154(c).</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, I know that's the provision you want to talk about, but 1155, it's perhaps an understatement to say that it confers a measure of discretion. It confers about the broadest measure of discretion that you could imagine. The Secretary of Homeland Security may at any time for what he deems to be good and sufficient cause. Anything that he deems to be good and sufficient cause seems to fall under that.</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Well, it allows the -- the agency to come up with lots of additional reasons. It's  --it's a way of saying the agency, even in situations where the eligibility criteria have been satisfied, we can come up with additional reasons. We can stop visa petitions coming through. But I think the -- the government's way of reading it means that it allows more visa petitions through. I mean, to use one example,  they use the example --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, we would have to -- wouldn't  we have to say when it refers to what he deems to be good and sufficient cause, that doesn't govern because it is not good and sufficient to -- well, anyway, all right. Never mind. Go ahead. Continue.</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Oh, I mean, I -- and I  -- I mean, to use the babysitter example we gave in our  -- in our hypothetical, you can have a situation where the babysitter has  -- for good and sufficient cause, can take away the iPad, a very broad array of discretion. But you can also have a rule saying no iPad at the dinner table. And  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> But it doesn't say  -- you changed it. You said where the babysitter says for good and sufficient cause, not what the babysitter deems to be. </text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Yeah. For  -- for what the babysitter deems to be good and sufficient cause, they have free discretion. And it can be a terrible reason. They can say:  Oh, you know,  you looked at me the wrong way, I'm going to take away the iPad. And the -- and the parent couldn't complain. But, if the parent said no  iPad at the dinner table and comes home and finds that someone is at the dinner table with the iPad, it would be very strang e to say, well, you said, for good and sufficient cause, I could take away the iPad in other situations. That's not the kind of discretion that's being spoken to in that situation. And that's what we have here, which, again, routes us back to 1154(c) and --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. </text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Thank you. I'm sorry.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> If I understand the argument, it's that we're supposed to ignore the very discretionary language of 1255 because of the very non-discretionary language of 1154(c). But the non-discretionary language of 1154(c) does not pertain to revocations. It applies -- it pertains instead to the initial approval or denial of a petition. And you're saying, well, how could it be that you  -- that that wouldn't also pertain to revocations?  But there might be good reasons  why Congress would have thought, no matter what you do or no matter what we demand that you do at the initial stage, once you've already given a petition, there might be reasons to just keep the status quo going. There might be  --it might be costly to change. There might be reliance interests. Whatever. The --the decision to revoke is just different from the decision to approve or deny in the first instance. So this language about approving or denying in the first instance doesn't really speak to the decision to revoke, which is instead governed by 1255.</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> I think all of that might be true in a situation where what's being given is  --is something other than just that piece of paper. But the government has been very clear. Its longstanding position is there's no reliance interest in this piece of paper because it's just  --it confers no substantive benefits. All it is is something that says you met those criteria. It's al l -- that's literally the entire value of the paper. And you take it to the next -- and you take it to the agency the next day and it says, I met the criteria. And if the government has now decided you don't meet those criteria, then I think it has to take the piece of paper away. And that's  why I think the examples are sort of helpful --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Yeah, I don't know what the government will say to that, but it does seem to me that under the statute, if you have an approved petition, you're entitled to certain benefits. So, if you have an approved petition, you're entitled to those benefits even though you might say, oh, the approval was -- was wrong in the first instance.</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> But the only benefit you're entitled to is the fact that you have that piece of paper that allows you to go apply for the green card. That -- that's literally what that approved petition means. And if the government has said you're in a sham marriage and we don't actually think that you are able to apply for -- you know, apply for the green card, we're going to deny  the green card probably, we have to deny the green card. I think that's what they think, that they have to deny the green card. Then the  discretion we're talking about in this case --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, they have to deny the green card if they've revoked the petition, but they don't have to deny the green  card if the person has an approved petition and nothing's happened to it.</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Well, that's an interesting question. I think that  -- that's a question, I think, for the government. The government's longstanding position has been the -- the 1154(c) sham-marriage bar. Congress enacted it. It's one of very few restrictions like this that is non-waiveable. It was such a fundamental thing that they said your petition shouldn't even get off the ground. Your application should  --and it's -- and it's, you know, described as one of the most serious and disabling judgments you can have against you. You can  --it's perpetual. It's non-waiveable. You can never become  --you can never get U.S. status. So that's why it's so fundamental. And the government's position, I think, is that, yeah, we are not able to give you the ultimate immigration benefit. If the government says, yes, we can exercise discretion to just let you through the system and get a green card, I think their argument looks different. I don't think they've said that anywhere in their briefs. And that would be contradictory to their longstanding  position. And that's all consistent with, in fact, what happens in the real world, which is that in over 50 -- you know, 50 years or maybe even 70 years, there has just never been an instance  where this purported discretion has ever been exercised. So where this all cashes out is this means nothing other than taking away judicial review from people who, you kn ow, have this -- you know, this very disabling judgment made against them. And, in some instances, that means getting kicked back in line and having to wait 10 more years. And the government cannot come up with a single reason why that makes any sense. It agrees that can be reviewed yeste rday. It can be reviewed tomorrow. It's the kind of decision that's generally reviewed. Why does it not allow review in this situation?</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank - - </text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> I've never seen a case quite like it.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.

I mean, that was the question this Court reserved in Patel. It's a threshold issue that wasn't raised in our case, so -- but I think it's  absolutely something that this Court can and should reserve. It has enormous ramifications. I mean, I think, if you -- if one were to hold that  --that both underlying eligibility determinations like this are reviewable and also that this provision that the review bar applies in the district courts, that applies to dozens and dozens of provisions across the immigration code, administering things like U visas and T visas for victims of child trafficking, VAWA self-petitions, adjustment of -- and various benefits administrations, status adjustments, all kinds --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So it wasn't  -- it wasn't briefed, though, in this case?</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> It wasn't briefed in this case, so I -- I can't --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So any holding against you would have to make clear that we're reserving that issue?</text><speaker>Samir Deger-Sen</speaker><text> Reserving that issue. The same issue that was reserved in Patel. Absolutely.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Ms. Sinzdak.</text>","<speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and  may it please the Court:  There were more than 900,000 I-130 visa petitions filed last year, and USCIS granted, denied, or revoked more than 800,000 such petitions. Given this volume, Congress had every reason to streamline judicial review by prohibiting litigation at the revocation  stage. And, to be clear, the government believes that Congress did prohibit litigation by making revocations discretionary, including in the face of a sham-marriage determination. The government does not view a revocation as mandatory in that stage, and I am not aware of a longstanding position of the kind that counsel suggests. The text is very clear on this. Section 1252 bars review of actions, the authority for which is specified to be in the  discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security. And Section 1155 specifies that the  Secretary's authority to revoke visa petitions is discretionary at least three times over, as Justice Alito was noting. It uses the term ""may,"" which connotes discretion. It uses the term ""deems,"" which  fairly exudes discretion. And it uses the capacious term ""good and sufficient cause,"" which calls for a discretionary judgment. Now I -- I don't hear Petitioner today to be advancing the secondary argument that I think we saw in his briefing with respect to the idea that a sham -- at least an underlying sham-marriage determination might be reviewable even if the revocation decision itself is  not because the revocation decision is clearly discretionary under Section 1155, and I think that's for good reason. I don't think that this Court has ever suggested that someone can evade a judicial review bar on review of a decision by breaking that decision into its constituent parts. And, here, the text of Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is very clear because it says that you  --it puts the focus on the nature of the agency's authority. So it says:  A decision, the authority for which is specified  to be in the Secretary's discretion. And any decision that the Secretary is making using his discretionary revocation authority is therefore covered. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>Colleen E.

Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> I do think that you've put your finger on perhaps the oddity of this statute, which is that approval is banned, and that's a mandatory decision, but revocation is discretionary. I think that, as Justice Jackson was suggesting, that is to the benefit for the most part of non-citizens because it allows some discretion on the part of the agency to decide not to revoke when it notices that it has made a mistake in the past. So I -- I agree that's a little bit odd. It is the plain text of the statute. And  I think that in -- in the mine-run of situations, it's going to be helpful to non-citizens.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Ms. Sinzdak, your friend on the other side suggested that the government has never exercised its discretion to overlook a sham marriage. Is that correct?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> We do not have a record of the government overlooking a sham marriage. We do not keep records with respect to times that the government  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Are you aware of any case?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> I -- I am not.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. The other question I had is your friend on the other side also suggests that this obligation of approval is ongoing because you cannot grant a green card either or any kind of visa relief in the end if there is a sham marriage. Is that right?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> No. So there is a -- the  -- the -- the government has the discretion whether or not to revoke. Then, at the green -- green card stage, I believe Justice Sotomayor was alluding to another statute, which is 80  -- 1182(a)(6).</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Six.</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> That says that if the non  -- the non -citizen has made a misrepresentation in order to get immigration benefits of any kind, then he has no  eligibility. But that, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, is waiveable. There can be a waiver. So I think that's the way that the -- the statutes interact.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Can you explain that to me a little bit more?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> Sure. So 1182 -- again, 1182(a)  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That's non-discretionary as well, (a)(6), right?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> It  --it is  -- it --it says that the -- the non-citizen is inadmissible. But the way in which it becomes, I  -- I suppose you could say, discretionary, in that there is a discretionary waiver under 1182(i), which says that in an instance where there has been extreme hardship, where -- on -- where there would be extreme hardship to a U.S. citizen  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> U.S.</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> --then the government has the discretion to waive 1182(a)(6)'s admissibility bar.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> But, other than that carveout for an effect on a U.S. citizen, the  bar is mandatory?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So I think that's your friend's point, is that throughout the process, a sham marriage is, in many cases, an absolute non-discretionary bar to relief.</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> And that's simply incorrect.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And  --and you -- and you put that together with the fact the government's unable to point to a single circumstance in which it's ever waived the sham-marriage requirement, and it's starting to look pretty non-discretionary. I think that's the nature of the argument.</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> The question under (b)(2) is whether Congress has specified that a decision is in the discretionary author ity of the Secretary.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right. But that's -- that's the question.</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> There's just no --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I mean, you're stating the question rather than giving the answer. So help me with the answer.</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> Sure. The answer is that Section 1155 makes the decision whether to revoke discretionary. So, because the statute makes it discretionary, the fact that the agency has always exercised it in one particular direction doesn't have anything to do with the applicability of the review bar.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Got it. Next --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Can you imagine  -- I'm sorry.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I'm sorry. I'll finish real quick.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> The  --the case -- cases below which you cite and rely on have this broad reading of the bar. But many of them, including the Eleventh Circuit, also permit  review on an allegation of procedural error, including, it seems, procedural error of regulations that the  --the agency's adopted itself. Where do you stand on whether those decisions are reviewable?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> That's right. There is something of a circuit dispute. It's n ot implicated here. I  -- I --I think that we think that procedural errors are similarly foreclosed by the discretionary relief bar.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So, even if the government completely abandons its existing procedures, ignores them willy -nilly, that's not reviewable in the government's view?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> If we're talking about a procedural error. And  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> --here, I'm setting aside constitutional claims  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> --which I think go at least into a different basket, then  -- --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I'm talking about procedural errors.</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> --yes. I think a judicial review bar, the way that it works is to bar claims that the government has made a mistake, including in that way.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So, if the government makes a mistake by throwing all the  papers up in the air and say, we're going to -- we're going to revoke the pile that lands over there, despite all of our fine -tuned regulations</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> I --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- that the bar on judicial review applies?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> I think that when Congress enacts judicial review bars, it assumes that the agency is not going to behave like a monster or --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I would have thought. But you're  --you're telling me that they can.</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> I'm telling you that Congress has made the decision that it does not think that kind of behavior is going to happen, or at least that it's going to be such a fringe case that the benefits of barring judicial  review are going to be worth it.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Got it. Thank you. I'm sorry.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> You said that you didn't know of a case in which revocation wasn't the decision, but you -- but you also said you didn't know of a policy that made revocation automatic. Is that what you said?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> Yes. So I think there's a couple of things here. First of all, USCIS does not keep records of times that it decided not to revoke. So I'm not sure that I would be aware if there were these non ---</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Okay. I was really asking about the second half of that. You said you were not aware of any policy that revocation was automatic.</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> That's right. It is not</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So, in all your conversations, which I imagine you  -- you had, with the people who are implementing this l aw, they said, we -- we don't have a policy that revocation is automatic. We think that we have discretion.</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> I want to be clear. They believe that they have statutory discretion. Sham-marriage -- the sham-marriage bar is not one of the reasons for automatic revocation. Those reasons are set out --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I  --I understand. We're talking about, in practice, do they think of themselves as having a policy of yes, of course, we would always revoke?  Or do they think of themselves as having something like: Well, of course, we would usually revoke, but we retain the right to not revoke in certain circumstances?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> I think that it's exactly what we said in our brief, which is that they do strive to revoke when they determine that there has been a sham -marriage determination. They're not required to do so by statute. And that's dispositive with respect to the application of the judicial review bar. But I do think that they are  --where they find sufficient evidence, they are revoking.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So what you're saying  is that there really are no set of circumstances in which they would say, in this case, because  of the peculiarities of this case, we're not going to revoke?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> I can't say that there would never be that circumstance. They have not  -- they -- when I have spoken to them, what they  have said is that, in general, if they do find sufficient evidence, they will revoke. But let me just, again --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, I guess, you know, the ""in general"" in that sentence, is it in general, or is it always?  Like, when you talk to them, do they say:  Of course, we always revoke?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> Well, I think, quite honestly, the problem is that this is being done by individual adjudicators who have been given discretion under the statute. And so what they are telling  -- telling me is that, to their knowledge, where there are -- the evidentiary burden is satisfied, the agency generally is going to revoke if it determines that there has been a sham marriage but not that the statute requires it. And that's the key -- that's the key question. And I just want to make clear, because I think it's getting a little fuzzy, we're looking at discretionary authority, and -- and so if I can just give kind of my own child  hypothetical. If I tell my daughter that she may have dessert after dinner every night, she has discretionary authority to decide whether to have dinner  -- whether to have dessert. As a practical matter, she is going to eat dessert every single night. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> I can assure you of that. But I have given her discretionary authority. And so, if there was a judicial review bar, it would cover.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But -- but your daughter would be able to tell you:  I have a policy of giving -- of having dessert. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So I'm asking, do they have a policy of never -- of always revoking?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> I -- I think what you have seen is there is -- it's not an automatic grounds for revocation. I  -- I have not -- the -- the agency could not point me to a case where they have decided not to revoke. I -- I -- what I'm concerned about, and I don't want to misrepresent to you, is whether there's some sort of unwritten policy. I don't know whether the adjudicators all sort of sit around and say, of course, because 1154(c) seemed to have been really, really important to Congress, we really do  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> How --</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> --always revoke. I just don't know.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> How many decisionmakers are there?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> There are many. I do not know the exact number.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Do you agree that Bouarfa could obtain judicial review by refiling a petition in this case?  The government's not going to pop up and say if he tries to do that, no?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> That's correct. He might not need to if he does  --sorry, it's a  -- Bouarfa is a she.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> She. Excuse me.</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> She  --no, my --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Sorry.</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> She  --if she refiles and the  -- and the agency tooks a -- takes a fresh -- since she has refiled, if the agency takes a fresh look at the facts or if she were  to submit additional evidence, the agency could, of course, change its mind. But, if it did not, then, yes, judicial review would be available.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Then she could get review judicial review at that point?  All right. The applicability of the judicial review bar in 1252 it seems to me is a threshold determination that hasn't been briefed here. So, if we agree with you that the discretionary nature -- about the discretionary nature of the revocation provision, would you have any problem with a line that expressly preserves that threshold question?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> I don't think that it's a threshold question because I think Congress was quite clear here in terms of the language of (b), which says that it applies regardless of whether the judgment, decision, or action is made in removal proceedings. I haven't been  able to think of another way to read that line. I  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, I mean, you -- you  -- you -- you think the issue comes out in the government's favor, but, clearly, it's a threshold question. I mean, we have  -- we --we -- we would have to decide whether 1252 applies. And my concern is that by just jumping to your conclusion -- let's say I, for the purpose of this, agree with you that this is a discretionary decision under 1154 or 1155. We only get to precluding judicial review through 1252, correct?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> In other words, the -- the -- the judicial stripping -- the -- the jurisdiction stripping comes from 1252?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> That's correct. Now I don't want to hide the ball because there is jurisdiction stripping in the APA context because the APA bars review of decisions that --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes. Setting that aside, the parties here have been assuming that the jurisdiction stripping is coming from 1252?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And 1252 says you don't have jurisdiction of discretionary decisions. And so the argument here has been about whether or not this is a discretionary  decision. But there's a threshold issue because it seems to me  --at least I haven't found a case in which we have applied 1252 jurisdiction stripping in the non-removal context. So, if we were to suddenly say in agreement with you this is discretionary and, therefore, there's jurisdiction stripping under 1252, we would be assuming that 1252 applies in this context. And so I'm asking you  --you know, your counsel on the other side says, yes, we're all over here looking at the nature of this. Is it discretionary?  But you should at least make clear that there is this threshold issue and preserve it because we have not briefed it. Is the government on board with at least that little  --even though I know you think you win.</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> I will happily take the win in this case --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> --with the knowledge that in the future, I will win on this other question. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Fine. Okay. Thank you.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> But you don't think we should reserve it, right?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> I don't think there's any  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Because there's no</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> --ambiguity in the text.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I don't  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But we have to decide it. I mean, I'm just saying I don't want the answer to this question to necessarily decide -- and there's a  -- there's a cert petition, I understand, that's coming up that's asking just this question. Amicus here says this is a separate question. We don't have to -- you all haven't briefed the answer to this question, correct?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Justice Gorsuch's hypothetical would give rise to a constitutional challenge, wouldn't it?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> I --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That if  --if the INS just decided to throw the pile of applications on the floor?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> I -- I suspect that the non-citizen would raise a due process contention. I think they would then have to deal with Munoz. And I also want to be clear here there is division in the circuits regarding whether constitutional claims are reviewable in the revocation context because there is judicial review available after the denial of a visa petition, so this isn't a situation  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> What's your view on that?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> The government has not taken a position.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> The government has no position on whether an individual can raise a constitutional claim about a -- a  -- a --a violation in revocation?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> A non -citizen certainly can raise a constitutional claim after the denial of a  --such a petition.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> After the denial of the visa at the end of this process, which, as your friend points out, is a continuing process, but not after the revocation decision itself? That's the government's view?</text><speaker>Colleen E.

Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> --a position on that.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> You're not going to  -- we don't know?</text><speaker>Colleen E.

Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> --I would note, Justice</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Don't you think that's an important thing for us to know in terms of interpreting the scope of this, to say,  if we're going to insulate substantive and procedural determination  --questions, arbitrary-and-capricious-type decisions, the throwing the papers up in the air, and perhaps  that's what happened here, we don't know for all we know, don't you think it's important for us to understand whether you'd really even bar  constitutional questions?</text><speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> Justice Gorsuch, the Eleventh Circuit itself has treated these as separate issues because it has actually held that constitutional claims are reviewable. But, of course, we're up on a -- defending a decision in which it said that these claims are not reviewable.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> If you agree that it's reviewable at the end of the process, the visa process, why wouldn't the same be true here?  This question of the sham-marriage determination, would be  --would it be reviewable at the end of  --at the end of the process?</text><speaker>Colleen E.

""Entitled to SSI benefits"" in the same sentence should mean the same thing, qualifying for the SSI program. A person qualifies for the SSI program when she applies and is determined eligible, and that eligibility lasts until it is terminated. The government disagrees because it says that there's no such thing as an SSI program and the only SSI benefit is a monthly cash payment. But Congress created what it called a national program, and it created a program of income insurance. This is a program where a  person who's low income enough to qualify in the first place is promised a minimum guaranteed  income for a calendar year, and in the months where that income is not needed, the cash payment is suspended. Nothing is terminated, and other benefits remain available. In the end, this is about DSH, and DSH is about ensuring that hospitals are reimbursed for low-income patients that are less healthy and that are costlier to treat, and health does not change overnight.

A DSH proxy that does not measure the low-income population is no proxy at all. I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Are there other benefits other than cash under -- under, what is it, Title XVI?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> There are. There are non-cash benefits, including Medicaid continuation, and you can find that in 1382h(b), and there's also vocational rehabilitation, which you can find in Title XVI under 1382d. You know, the government's response to that, I think, is twofold. It's to say that non-cash is not income but probably more so to say that those aren't benefits under Title XVI. But they're both housed in Title XVI. They're both triggered by being program-eligible under Title XVI. And especially when it comes to Medicaid continuation, it's referred to as a benefit under 1382h, which is in Title XVI. The --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Could you clarify for me the Medicare  -- the Medicaid regulation that the government replies  --relies on?  It's some  --it has something to do with, if someone's on Medicaid, if they receive more than $30 a month in income, they're no longer eligible for SSI?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Yeah. So  --so this comes out of the SSI statute, and it makes sense  when you're thinking of -- of SSI. So the reasoning behind it is that while you're in a facility where Medicaid is paying for your daily needs, you don't need the full payment. Instead, you'll get this $30 comfort payment but only if your income is actually under $30. And for most people, because you get a Social Security check, that's not going to be the case. And I think that's one of the most significant problems with the government's approach, is it doesn't count any of those individuals as low income for purposes of the Medicare fraction. And it's really significant because we have two different fractions here, right?  One measures low income based on SSI. The other one measures it based on Medicaid eligibility. And so these are people that are, by definition, Medicaid-eligible and so low income when you think about the Medicaid fraction, yet because of the way they do the calculation here, they're actually not counted in either fraction. I think, in Empire --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Now I  -- I am a little concerned about the Medicaid situation because, as I understand it, when people are placed in nursing homes, they assign all of their income to the nursing home, and Medicaid then picks up whatever the difference is between that income and whatever the  --the authorized charge is. So, by the government counting the SSI as income to the patient, they're ignoring that the patient is only seeing about $30 a month.</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Yeah, and -- and I think even less than that. I mean, I think the real problem with the government's approach is that person, in -- in the terms of the -- the regulations, is thought of to be eligible for SSI but not payable, and those individuals just aren't counted at all for DSH purposes. And so I think there was an assumption in Empire Health that low-income individuals would be in one fraction or the other, one box or the other, but this takes these individuals who are indisputably low income in their hospital month and it doesn't count them at all. And I think this is one of the places where the government's arguments confuse the  purposes of the SSI statute and the purposes of DSH. And so, you know, maybe there's a good reason why they don't get a check, maybe there's  not, as Your Honor pointed out. But whatever the answer to that question is, it's specific to SSI. For DSH, there's absolutely no reason why they shouldn't be counted as low income for purposes of figuring out the hospital's reimbursement.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Sherry, am I correct  -- I just want to clarify that you're not challenging any of the specific codes, because people fall out for different reasons, you know, wrong address and all of that, some of the S codes?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> But you're not challenging any of those, and the D.C. Circuit held that those challenges were waived?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> So -- so I think what was going on in the D.C. Circuit was really challenges to what kind of happens behind the curtains as far as the counting goes. The challenge that we have is just to what the interpretation of the language should be. And, under our interpretation, all of those codes  would be counted because our view of it is that it's about program eligibility and someone is --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> But, if you lose, which let's just assume  --</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> -- if you --if you lost, it's still possible for you in other litigation, if -- even if not on remand, if it's waived, to challenge particular codes?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> I think it depends. I mean, I think the government's view  -- if the government's interpretation prevails here, I think all of those codes would be out because the government is  -- is defending what  --or I think defending, although maybe ask them, but I think defending what CMS is doing, which is only counting three codes. And that's at pages 47 and 48 of their brief. And so, if  -- if their interpretation prevails, they will continue to just count the three codes. And you can imagine litigation about whether they're doing that correctly, and there  has been litigation, you know, with respect to that, but as far as our differing interpretation goes, I think we're at two different extremes.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Because it seems to me like if you're eligible for a monthly payment because your income was low enough, but you didn't get the check because -- for all of the various administrative reasons why you might not get it, I could imagine you satisfying the statutory definition even under the government's approach but yet still be entitled to a check that somehow the codes don't account for.</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Yeah. So I  --I'm curious as to what the government's view are. I -- I can say that CMS is not counting those individuals, right, because they're only counting the three codes, and I think they're basing it -- we call it an actual receipt rule. Maybe it's an actually sent rule. But they're only counting those for which a payment has been sent by the time they do the matching process, so 15 months after. And anyone who doesn't have one of those three codes at the time, which would include all the individuals you're talking about, just wouldn't be counted. But I don't think you can just draw the line at those individuals because there's a second category, including the nursing home patients, who are still eligible. They're just not  payment-eligible in a particular month. They're not due a payment in that month. And  the government, I think, admits that all of those individuals fall out under their approach too. It includes those in their first month of eligibility. So they just went through the application process and were found to be low income, yet they 're not entitled to a check their very first month. Those individuals would not be counted. Also in the other category, there's individuals who are in prison, who also aren't counted because they're not due a check. That might make a lot of sense when it comes to SSI. It doesn't make any sense when it comes to DSH because the individuals who are low income who are in prison certainly aren't getting any healthier when they're transferred to  a hospital.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So, as a textual matter, you seem to be distinguishing program eligibility, as you say, and eligibility for a payment, and I'm just wondering whether that's pretty common. I mean, I sort of conceive of other benefits programs in the federal scheme in a similar way. I sort of thought that's what we were saying in Empire, that you could have Medicare where you have criteria for program eligibility, but just because you don't get the benefit doesn't mean that you don't qualify for the DSH fraction. Is that sort of how your argument works?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> It is, right. There's a differ ence between whether you have a right to payment at a  --at a particular time or for a particular service and whether you are in the program, whether you are entitled to benefits under the program. And we're making the same distinction here that the Court made in Empire Health in that respect. And I think you could look  --I mean, in terms of the actual textual language, you can look at a few provisions. The most notable one in the SSI statute we point out in our brief, it's in -- on pages 60  --sorry, 34A and 35A of the statutory addendum, and it's this financial records  provision, and it basically says:  You authorize us to access your financial records, and that authorization lasts until cessation of your  eligibility for benefits under Title XVI. And the government agrees that that has to mean program eligibility because, otherwise, it would be a very nonsensical system to have to get reauthorization every single month. And the regulations confirm that because they say that the authorization is valid until there has been a terminating event.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And so your argument just in terms of the purposes, because you brought that up before, is that you view DSH as trying to get at those people that  --</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Trying to get at the larger group of individuals.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> The larger group of program eligibility because it doesn't, in your view, make any sense that whether or not a person gets a payment is  --has some sort of relationship to the DSH fraction?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> That's exactly right. And if you look, actually, at the legislative history for DSH in the Senate report and in the conference report, where they're talking about the Senate bill, the language is the same there as it is now when it comes to SSI at least. And for that language, they describe it as wanting to count those who are enrolled in the SSI program, so both acknowledging that there is a program and focusing on the class of enrollees. And I think that is most consistent with the DSH purpose, but I think it's also most consistent with the text of DSH, which talks about ""entitled to benefits,"" plural, and also excludes one particular benefit, which is state supplementation. So it's a broad definition, but it's also a nuanced one that would include everything else that is not excluded, which includes the cash benefits but also includes things like Medicaid continuation and also vocational rehabilitation. Both are within Title XVI.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Can I step back a minute, Ms. Sherry, and just ask you about the nature of your argument?  Because you start both  in the briefs and then again this morning, you know, by saying ""entitled to benefits"" can't  mean the same thing when it's used twice in one  -- can't mean different things when it's used twice in one sentence. But, of course, this is ""entitled to benefits under Medicare"" and ""entitled to benefits under SSI.""  And -- and Empire was all about what ""entitled to benefits under the Medicare program"" meant. I mean, it did a sort of micro-analysis of the Medicare statute and its structure and its purposes and its text. So, if we thought that the SSI program was completely different, if we thought that  -- and I know your argument is that it's not  -- but, if we thought that, this argument about the language can't mean different things in the same sentence would completely go away, isn't that correct?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Partially. So I want to clarify. We think you have to st art with the DSH statute, and we think you have to start with Empire, but that's not to say you shouldn't look to the SSI statute. You  need to do that to determine whether someone qualifies for a program. Now, as far as what ""entitle"" means, I do think there would still be an oddity in terms of saying ""entitled"" does not mean right to  payment, it means eligible in one part, then ""entitled"" means right to payment, it doesn't mean eligible, and then you get down to ""eligible"" and you say it doesn't mean right to payment, it means the same as the first ""entitled"" but not the second ""entitled.""  So I do think that would be a complicated thing to do.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Wel l, I --I guess the question, though, is, you know, what it means to be entitled to benefits under either program. And if you thought what it meant is -- is very different to  --you know, that ""entitled to benefits under Medicare"" was very different from ""entitled to benefits under SSI"" or, similarly, that ""eligibility for benefits under Medicare"" was very different from ""eligibility for benefits under SSI,"" then that's the way you would read the statute, correct?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> I -- I think that's true if you focus on -- on benefits. And the only thing I'm pushing back on -- I would agree with you. I mean, if you took ""entitled to"" and you  ran it through the SSI statute and it became clear it's a term of art, it always means right to payment, you would, you know, probably  overcome the presumption and read it back in. But ""entitled to"" is not a term of art in the SSI statute. It's rarely used. And so that doesn't work.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, just to put this  --</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> But then the other  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- at its most starkest form, you know, suppose -- and I -- I know that you vigorously resist this, and  -- and I'm not suggesting the -- I'm just -- let's just assume for a second that SSI was, like, not an insurance program of the kind that Medicare is, nor is it a program that gives you a panoply of benefits but that, instead, it was simply a -- a cash subsidy that is given on a month-to-month basis. Let's just say that. And I know you have a thousand objections to that. But, I mean, then you would say: Well, you know, then the government has to be right, notwithstanding that it's ""entitled to,"" ""entitled to"" in the statute.</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Right. That would be a different case because you would say, when you qualify for the SSI benefits, it is limited just  to that monthly right to payment. I mean, if it was just people off the street, right, there's no program, there's no application process, just every month you call up, say, I checked these three boxes, give me a check, the next month you call up again,  and there's no application process, there's no program, there's no other benefits, yes, it would be completely not okay.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> The --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So it's just that, you know, just to put it in its starkest form, in the end, this is a question about the nature of SSI, right?  If you're right, you win. If the government is right, the government wins. In the sense of is SSI a program that  gives you lots of different kinds of benefits once you qualify for it, one might go away, but you  retain the others, or is SSI just a monthly check that you get in the mail?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> I think that is a key part of the analysis. I would hesitate to say  it's everything because I think you still have to come back to the text of DSH, and I think yo u still have to come back to the purpose of DSH.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And --</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> And so --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, your  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- so how -- go ahead. Go ahead.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> I mean -- I mean, your lead argument is -- and it's -- you know, it's catchy when you read it -- that the phrase ""entitled"" -- ""entitled to benefits"" can't mean two things. But following up on what Justice Kagan was asking, I don't see how th e government's argument does that at all. What you're saying seems to me, when you think about it, terribly superficial. It's the nature of the entitlement. So ""entitled to benefits"" can mean exactly the same thing in these two contexts, but it -- you know, ""entitle"" -- it's the nature of the entitlement. So, if the entitlement is different under Medicare and under SSI, then that argument falls apart.</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> So I think there's two ways to look at the government's argument. One  is it's interpreting ""entitled"" to mean two different things. I think, during the Empire Health argument, that was a concern. It was Problem 1 with the government's interpretation there. But I think, even if you don't read it that way and you read it as focusing just on the qualifications for the program and SSI being different, it doesn't hold up on that ground either. So you can take, you know, everything about the same word meaning the same thing and put it to the side and just focus on the SSI statute, and it doesn't look different in any way that  matters to then Medicare Part A.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. So we get -- we get to those arguments. Now another argument that you have is that this is like Empire Health. But isn't Medicare different from SSI in at least two very important effect -- respects that Empire Health emphasized?  SSI payments are not automatic and they're not enduring. Isn't that -- that true?  And that is not true of Medicare?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> They  --there are differences, but the differences, I think, actually, as far as it not being automatic point in our direction. So, yes, you need to apply to be entitled to SSI benefits, but I think that helps our interpretations because, basically, there are application bookends on either side that show that there is a program that you are eligible for. And so the difference here is Medicare Part A, you're automatically entitled. Here, you have to apply. But, once you apply, then we're in the same world. Then you are entitled to SSI benefits and you're entitled to them until you've been terminated from the program. The statute distinguishes between suspensions and terminations, and the regulations do the same thing. Part  -- subpart (m) of the regulations separate out suspensions from terminations, and you can't be suspended unless there's something to be suspended from. And so I think the application distinction works in our favor.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> The -- keep going. Sorry.</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Oh, no.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, I think the question from both Justice Kagan and Justice Alito, at least as I understand them, is  -- boils down to is SSI similar in relevant respects to Medicare for purposes of interpreting this statutory provision. And I think the government emphasizes two things, maybe more. One, that Medicare's an insurance program and SSI, they say, is not. And, two, at least the big picture that  I understand, people drop in and out of SSI more readily than they do on Medicare. And I think how we analyze those two questions determines how similar SSI is to Medicare at least as I understand it. So I want you to focus on the -- insurance description and the falling in and out  as distinct from Medicare.</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Sure. So, on the insurance distinction, this is -- you know, it's not health insurance, obviously, but it's income insurance. It's not just this monthly payment to strangers on the street. The whole concept</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> What do you mean by the word  --I'm going to ask the government this too  --what do you mean by the word ""insurance""?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Almost assurance. So  -- so the -- the concept here is that you're guaranteed a minimum income for the calendar year once you're part of the program, once you've applied and been accepted. I think of it as if, you know, you have a college graduate whose parents say congratulations, go get yourself an apartment, and we will send you a rent check for every month in which you don't have enough money to cover rent. And so, if you have a job and you're making money and you can cover it, you're on your own, but if you come up short, we'll cover the difference, and we'll do that until  you've been able to string together 12 months where you've been able to pay for your own rent,  at which point deal's off, you're on your own. That's really what the SSI program is. So it's not just the cash payment in a given month or making up the difference. It's knowing  that you're guaranteed this minimum income for as long as you're in the program.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And then the -- the dropping out, I think one of the government's suggestions is you can drop out of SSI more readily and somehow that, for purposes of the questions Justice Kagan and Justice Alito were asking, makes SSI relevantly different.</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Right. So I don't think that's a distinction either. I'm not sure, even if it were, it would matter, but I don't think it's a distinction because there's two kind s of eligibility and it depends what the government is talking about. There's program eligibility, and individuals do not drop out of the program all that often. I think the  --the statistics the government give -- and it's in the Joint Appendix from the court of appeals; it's at page -- is that about 350,000 people in -- I think it's in 2009 were terminated for excess income. First of all, that's about 5 percent of the population. But, if you look more  closely at those who are likely to be Medicare-eligible, so over the age of 65, and that's at the bottom of that page, it's roughly about 35,000 people total who drop out. The reality is most stay in this program for a long time, and so I think it's actually quite stable.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Do people drop out of Medicare  --</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> I think people drop out</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- when  --</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> -- when they're no longer disabled  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> -- would be the primary example.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> And so I  --I think, you know, once you get down to it, it's pretty comparable. And then, if you look at  payment eligibility in terms of, like, the month-to-month payments, in Empire Health, it was recognized that people might not get payment for particular services because they've exceeded the 90 days, for example, or because a primary payor is paying. So there's some lack of  stability when it comes to payment for Medicare Part A. And then you translate that over to SSI and they again point to statistics -- and this is the prior page, 146, of the Joint Appendix from the court of appeals  -- and that number is higher. It's about 600 -- I think 650,000 individuals in 2009 who were suspended for excess income. But, again, if you focus on the over-65 number, it's about 71,000 people. And so, even when it comes to payment eligibility, it's not nearly as variable as they suggest it is.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Ms. Sherry, if we might take a hypothetical. Let  --let's say I have a 70-year-old person who's deemed eligible for SSI because of his income but then certain months in the year makes over a million dollars a month. I know that's unlikely, but let's just suppose it. Is he entitled to benefits for the full  year?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> I would  -- I --I would say he probably doesn't meet the resource qual- -- so -- so you need to have --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> He's not eligible for those months.</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Well, he's probably not eligible to begin with, but if -- even if we assume he's  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> But  --no, but let's -- let's just --</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> --spending the million dollars  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> No, no, let's assume at the beginning of the year --</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- for some months, he is indeed entitled to and eligible for benefits and -- and he gets them, but then, in certain months, he makes well in excess of the -- the income threshold.</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> So -- so he --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Is he entitled to benefits under your view for the full year?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> He -- he is until he's terminated from -- from the program. And I think there's one good explanation for it  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So he's  --</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> -- and one reason --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- entitled to benefits  --</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- even though he's not eligible for them?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> He's not eligible for the cash payment, and  -- and let's just assume he's also not eligible for, you know, Medicaid continuation and -- and vocational rehab. He's still entitled to benefits, and that's because of the concept of conditional entitlement that was at issue in Empire Health as well. Entitlement coexists with limitations on payment. That's what the Court said in Empire Health. And the statutory language the Court relied on for that in Medicare Part A is also present in SSI. And so, if you look a t the SSI statute, 1381a, it talks about being eligible for payment or I think it says ""paid subject to the provisions of this chapter"" and then the comparable language in Medicare Part A.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, it seems to me Medicare is quite different from this in that respect. I mean, the -- there were lots of arguments in Empire Health, but one of the main  ones was, even if you had reached the cap on hospital care, there were other kinds of care that you could access under Medicare. So you had reached the cap in terms of your hospital stay, but you could get outpatient treatment for some other condition. So the Medicare was not going away. But, here, the only thing that there is, which really is the cash payment, is going away in the months in which the person receives more than the threshold income, isn't that right?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> So, I -- I mean --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> There's nothing left?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> --again, assuming this person is not eligible for Medicaid continuation and vocational rehab, there's the guarantee, but I  -- I think this is where you have to take a step back and look at the purposes of DSH because I think you can come up with this hypothetical example, but I do think it pales in comparison to the real -world categories of low-income individuals who are left out if you're looking at the two on a scale. And even with the $1 million hypothetical, that person -- you know, DSH is not looking at low income for low income's sake. It's looking at it because it's trying to identify a class of individuals who are less healthy and more costly for the hospital. And so, if that person was low income enough to qualify in the first place, just because he's getting a million dollars in one month is not going to change his health overnight in a way that's going to matter to the hospital's bottom line.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you -- thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Assume  -- assume that the vocational rehabilitation benefit that you th ink is a part of Title XVI and the 1382h that you think is a part of it, how about if we disagree that the vocational rehab is a -- is a program run separately from Title XVI?  So what are you left with?  Are you left only with the argument that this is a  -- and it's a powerful argument, I'm not denigrating it -- that this is  an insurance program for a year, that you're guaranteed payment at least if your income is low for that year, so if you don't get it one month, you're still going to be getting it the second, third, or fourth?  That sounds like a program to me too. But part of your argument that some of my colleagues are focused on is the fact that there are no other benefits for that month.</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Right. So, if you disagree on the non-cash benefits, then, yes, we are  arguing that it is a program -- it's an income insurance program. And you don't need the non-cash benefits to agree with us on that and rule for us on that. I think it's an additional -- it's icing, so to speak. I think you do have to, though  -- if you agree that there's non -cash benefits, there's no way to rule for the government because their position rests on it only being about cash. So I don't think we need the non-cash benefits to win.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So why don't you spend a moment on the government's counter-arguments as to why those two provisions are not part  --they're not additional benefits?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Sure. So let me start with vocational rehabilitation just because I touched a little bit on Medicaid continuation already. It is a benefit provided under Ti tle -- you know, it's housed in Title XVI. You can look at 1382d, which is in Title XVI. It was 6 -- it is 1615 of the Social Security Act, so very much in Title XVI. Secondly, it is funded by Title XVI. The appropriations under 1381 is where the funding comes from. And you qualify it if you are a Title XVI disability beneficiary. And so the person who is in the SSI program is getting reimbursement or the state is getting reimbursement for that benefit because they are covered by -- by Title XVI. So in every which way it's a Title XVI benefit. The government's counter-argument, putting the non-cash issue to the  side, is that it shouldn't qualify as under Title XVI essentially because it's also under Title XI and it's also under states. That doesn't hold up  because it reads ""under"" as exclusively under. And yet, in DSH itself, they excluded state supplementation benefits, which are not exclusively under Title XVI. They're provided by states. Yet Congress understood them to be  benefits under Title XVI such that they needed to be excluded. And so there's a real inconsistency between those two positions. On Medicaid continuation, almost all of the same arguments, you can find it in 1382h. It is 1619(b), and it is also triggered by eligibility in the SSI program. But, on that one too, you can look throughout Title XVI and see it referred to as a benefit under 1382h. --1383j is one place to look. I believe it's also in subsection (k) and subsection (p).</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I have a couple questions. On Justice Gorsuch's hypothetical about the SSI millionaire, I mean, that's  unlikely to happen in the real world, but it could happen. But couldn't it also happen that  someone on Medicare has, you know, golden insurance, private insurance that's going to cover them, so they never really need Medicare  even though they're in the Medicare program?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Yes. And I  -- I suspect that's -- that's somewhat more -- more likely than the million -dollar  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> It -- it is more likely why?  Why is  -- I think it is more likely. Why is that more likely?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Well, because everyone is entitled to Medicare when they -- when they turn 65. And some who have turned 65 are  -- are quite well off and they have amazing insurance. And so I  --I think the million-dollar hypothetical is a hypothetical for  -- for a reason. The reality is the individuals who do not get payments in certain months because of excess income are probably not the millionaire or the lottery winner or any of those other hypotheticals you can come up with but, instead,  are individuals who slightly pop over the income threshold by a small amount in a month, only to fall back under it the following month. And that's the reason why there are so few that are terminated from the program, because they can't string together 12 months of income stability.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> So, for people who do pop over for a month, over the limit, most of them stay in the program because they're back under the limit at some point, is that correct  --</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- percentage -wise?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> A large percentage of them, right?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Yes, a very significant percentage.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Then, on Medicare as well, it was going away. I  -- I mean, I might have a different understanding  --in fact, it's almost certain I have a different understanding of Empire than Justice Kagan does, but  -- (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- I thought -- I thought Medicare was going away for that day if you had the private insurance, but we nonetheless  -- the Court nonetheless said you'r e still entitled to Medicare even though you  didn't have any Medicare coverage for that day. Is that --</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> That's right. And I think, you know, there's a couple different things that come in there, but I think that's where the conditional entitlement comes in. It's the season ticket holder example from the Empire Health briefing.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. And then last question. This is very technical, but what happens in the real world may affect how plausible it is that Congress would have chosen one interpretation over another. So, if you lose, what's going to happen, realistically, to rural hospitals and urban hospitals that serve safety net -- as safety nets?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Yeah. So, here, I would point to the amicus briefs, which -- which go through it in some detail. The reason Congress  created the DSH adjustment to begin with was because of the higher cost of treating a low-income population, and hospitals that treat a disproportionate share need this money in order to stay afloat for  --for many hospitals. And for others, the point is to provide  -- to incentivize them to provide the services that are needed to service this vulnerable and at-risk population, and without a proper reimbursement under the formula, tha t's going to be very difficult and has been very difficult for hospitals to do.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And hospitals will close, or do you think that's not realistic?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> No, I think that is --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> An amicus brief suggests rural hospitals are going to close.</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> I -- I think that is realistic. I mean, the amicus briefs go in some detail about how close the margins are and how difficult it is and how significant the -- the DSH adjustment and the particular amount of the DSH adjustment is not only to DSH but to other programs that piggyback off of eligibility for DSH.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?  Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes. Justice Kagan asked you how close is this to Medicare given the way the DSH statute is constructed, and I guess I'm a little concerned that how close it is or how much it looks like or how much it operates like is really beside the point. So, if we set aside Medicare for a second and we just look at this program, and if we assume, as Justice Kagan does, that this is just about the cash payment, I am wondering about the distinction that you're drawing between eligibility for the program, which we can call entitlement, versus eligibility for the payment. As I understood it, eligibility for the program, or entitlement, gives you the assurance that in any month during the next year  when you fall below the income cap, the government will send you a check. So that's  what's left. Even in a month where you don't get a check, you know that maybe next month you will if you don't have this extra cash coming in. Am I right about that?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> That's absolutely right. And for more than a year. You have that assurance for so long as you haven't been able to string together 12 consecutive months of higher income.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And you also have the government working for you in that effort, right?  So, when you apply, you apply to this program, and you have to meet the eligibility criteria. I'm looking at the statute, and it gives the criteria of you being aged or blind or disabled. Do you have a certain income?  Do you have certain resources?  And the statute says: Shall be an eligible individual for the purposes of this subchapter. Setting aside all the other benefits, if I'm just focusing on the cash benefit, I would think one of the things that comes with  that is the government, every month, is monitoring your finances, and in any month in  which you go below the payment, they will send you a check automatically. Is that right?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> I think that's right in part. And the government can correct me if I'm wrong. I think, when you fall below it, you  might have to make a phone call and request reinstatement. That's a regulatory requirement. It's not in the statute itself. But  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you're entitled to do that?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Absolutely.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You know, X person on the street who's not enrolled in the program can't just ask the government for money. You get to do that because you are an entitled person and you met those original criteria, right?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Exactly. And that is the real difference, right, the  -- the person on the street, right?  This is not a case where every month you're just walking up to a window, filling out a form, and then walking aw ay with a check. Once you're in the program, you're in the program.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And you get the benefit of picking up the phone and calling the government and saying:  Please send me my check -- or the government does it automatically -- in any month in which you are entitled to  --to get it, right?</text><speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text> Right. And you authorize the government to have access to your financial records for so long as you're in the program so they can continue to check your income against the guaranteed monthly income.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.

SSI benefits are monthly cash payments made by SSA when a person meets eligibility requirements in a particular month, including the requirement of having low income in that month.

I  -- I --I'm so confused by your argument, I have to say. I'm struggling to  understand why an individual's eligibility for payment in a particular month has any bearing on the goals of compensating hospitals for the  higher cost of low-income people. So let me give you a hypothetical. Imagine a man who's lived well below the poverty line for his entire life. He has a range of health conditions that result from that kind of upbringing. When he turns 65 in January, he applies for SSI payments and starts receiving them in February pursuant to the statute and  the regulations. Let's say in June he comes into a bit of cash. He inherits some jewelry. He sells it. He picks up an extra shift at work. He gets money back from a friend who owes it to him, okay?  We can all agree that if the extra cash he gets in June brings him above the threshold, he doesn't get a cash payment that month because now he's above the threshold. But the Medicare fraction, I thought, was not about how much cash a patient had in any particular month. It's about how costly it would be to treat this person. And I don't understand why it is less or more costly in June, when he has the heart attack, than in May, when he didn't  --</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Your Honor  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- when he doesn't get the cash payment.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> So, Your Honor, I think that understanding of the statute rests on an erroneous premise in Petitioners' argument, which is their misreading of subsection (a), which is entitled ""Eligible Individual Under 1382.""  They think that means you look back to the person's income over the last calendar year in the application to see has this person been poor for the last calendar year. If that were how the statute worked, I would agree with you that --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why isn't that the part of the statute that DSH is referring to?  I mean, it's clear that that part of the statute says this person, the person for the year, shall be eligible under SSI. That's in the statute. So what I'm asking is, doesn't it make more sense that the DSH program, which is trying to capture people who are low income in this general sense because they will have more  serious and more difficult to treat, costly to treat, health issues, why isn't it referring to (a)?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> And what I  -- what I'm saying is (a) -- they are misreading (a). That is not how (a) works.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay. So let me  -- I thought the choice was between (a) and (b). You say the DSH program is referencing (b), which is  --or, sorry, (c), excuse me, which is the provision that says you get a payment in a particular month. And my question to you is, why would Congress care about whether you're getting a payment in a particular month as the marker of whether you are low income and it's more costly?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Because that is the entirety of the SSI statute. (a) does not work the way that Your Honor is posting. (a) is establishing the income limit for SSI eligibility. It's phrased in terms of a  calendar rate, but it is set monthly according to subsection (c)(1). And just to give you -- just to explain why textually that has to be right, Section 1382b is about --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I'm not asking you a textual argument. I'm ask  --I'm just asking you a purpose. You  -- your argument seems to result in people who get cash payments who have the exact same income level as someone who didn't get a cash payment, one is counted and one is not. And what I'm asking you is, why would Congress have set up the DSH program to make that distinction?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Because Congress picked up the SSI entitlement proxy as an off-the-rack proxy. It was a preexisting metric. It existed in 19 -- since 1972. Congress was acting in 1986. It just picked up this indirect proxy measure. It doesn't have to be perfect a hundred percent of the time. Theirs is not perfect a hundred percent of the time either, as Justice Gorsuch's hypothetical shows. And my point is that ours is more precise at capturing low-income people because we are looking to whether they establish low-income status and --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So let's talk to that, okay, whether it is more precise. Let me give you the hypotheticals. Someone's eligible, joins SSI in January, is hospitalized in  January, but they receive no cash payment in January. They're going to get it on February 1 because they just joined the program. Are you including those people?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> So, if they just joined, under the statute, those would not -- those people would not be entitled to benefits in the first month. And I think that  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Even though they are eligible because their -- they didn't make more money?  They should be. It's only they happen to join the program the month they got sick?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Your Honor, they're not eligible. That's an eligibility criteria. It says you're not eligible for payment until the second month after your application, and it's basically  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right. So it's not capturing people with low income even.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> So  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So your  -- you made a statement. We now have a group of people  that are not captured at all. Then you have the second hypothetical, which is that her income was high in January, so on February 1, her income has gone back down, but she's not going to get a payment because, on -- in January, her income was high.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> That's  --that's not correct, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> That is based on a misreading of (c)(1) and (c)(2) of  --of Section 1382. So Section (c)(2) would apply in the situation where someone is transitioning from ineligibility in a month to eligibility in the month. And what (c)(2) says is that in your first month back into eligibility, you look at your income in that month to determine whether the person is entitled to benefits.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But she still didn't get a check.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> She would get a check, is what I'm saying.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But when -- when is she going to see it?  She's not going to see it on February 1.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> She would see it in February  --she would get it  --she would get the check for purposes of February. And our rule does not turn on whether she actually receives the payment. Our rule is not an actual receipt rule. We've explained that extensively in the 2010 regulation. We do not apply an actual receipt test. We look to whether someone satisfies the statutory requirements for a cash payment during the relevant month in question. Whether they actually receive a check is irrelevant.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> I'm  --I'm confused about that, actually, because I was asking your friend on the other side these questions about, well, if there was some snafu because it bounced because of an address or something like that, whether they were challenging those codes, and she said no. But why isn't that an actual receipt rule if those people are excluded?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> They're -- so the way that works is, if they provide an address later in a  --in a subsequent month, we will go back and retroactively reinstate benefits for the prior month, and then that retroactive reinstatement will be counted for purposes of the numerator. So those  --those people will be reflected in the numerator because, when -- once they provide the address, we will go  back and --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Retroactively?  So then the hospital gets the benefit of the different DSH fraction later?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Exactly, because our data set goes 15 months beyond the end of the fiscal year precisely so that we can capture those retroactive benefits reinstatements once suspensions are lifted for administrative reasons. That's, again, in the 2010 rule. We discuss it towards the end of our brief.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Can I ask about the similarities --</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> --and differences with the Medicare?  So, as you're exploring these answers, you can bounce in and out of actually receiving social -- I mean SSI payments. You're in the program, they say, for a year, but you might not receive payments in a particular month. Right so far?  Medicare, the argument on the other side is similar in the sense that you're in the program, you qualified for Medicare, but you might have private insurance. Lots of people  do. And, therefore, any particular hospital stay in a given day, week, month might be paid for by your private insurance, not by Medic are. So, even though you're not getting Medicare payments, Medicare is paying zero, that, we said in Empire, is still going to be counted because you're in the program. So what's the difference between those two things?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> The difference goes to the structure of the statute. So, with Medicare Part A, there is a threshold eligibility determination, which is whether you're over 65 or have received disability benefits for 25 months. Once you get that, through that threshold step, you're into the program and you are entitled to a broad array of benefits. It's not just the in-patient hospital care  coverage. It's post-hospital care, hospice care, home healthcare. And --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> But how is that relevant to the question here, which is --</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- I thought, looking at payment?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Right. So  --and that -- that gets to the second layer of determinations under Medicare Part A. Each of those benefits has different payment limitations. So that -- that's what was at issue in Empire Health essentially.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Here, there's only one determination. It's all about month-to-month payment determination. There's no threshold program eligibility determination because that's not what subsection (a) does. Subsection (a) just establishes an income limit for SSI eligibility that is applied on a month -to-month basis under (c)(1). Subsection (a) is not its own threshold --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> But it seems to me -- I don't mean to press too hard, but it seems to me you're suggesting that there are multiple reasons Medicare might not pay maybe, and there's only one reason that SSI might not pay?  Is that what you're suggesting?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> What I'm trying to say is that their argument is that this is different because  -- or it's the same because they're both programs. And it's  -- our -- our point is that this is not a program the same --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> They're both programs in which you could be receiving payment in a relevant period but not for the precise period that you're in the hospital?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Right. And the difference is the structure of the benefits statutes. So SSI is all about month-to-month payments. There is no threshold --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> But you can't be  -- am I right that you can't be terminated from the program until, for a period of 12 consecutive months, your income has not exceeded -- or maybe 11 --</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> That's not how, actually, it works at least in -- in practice. So the way that that works is we terminate someone's name from the administrative  database, but we don't consider them part of a broader program in the same sense as Medicare Part A. So, basically --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> When do you terminate them from the database?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> After 12 months of ineligibility. And I actually think that's extremely important  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> But they're in the database. So let's say you drop out  -- I'm sorry to prolong it, but it's important to me at least. You drop out for a month. The next month -- because your income's gone above the limit. The next month, your income is below the limit. Do you have to do anything to receive the benefits in that next month?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> You don't need to do anything  --well, you would have had to tell them when -- when you go from eligibility to ineligibility. You're supposed to report changes in your status so that they know.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> That's not the question.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Right. The  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> The question's: In the next month --</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- when your income goes below the limit, do you have to do anything to receive the benefits in the next month?  I think your answer was no.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> If  --so, if you're transitioning from eligibility to ineligibility or vice versa, you do have to report those changes to SSA. I -- what I was going to say --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you don't have to reapply, right?  I think that's Justice Kavanaugh's question.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Right. And  -- and my point --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Mr. McDowell -- go ahead. I'm sorry.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, I'm not done. I'm not done.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Okay. My point about the application is that the application is actually just a monthly application. In the  application, they are just looking at your income in that month. It's essentially the same  thing as the later determinations; it's just in a form as opposed to done more seamlessly. But the actual substantive criteria  -- if you look at the application, they are asking: Are you low income in the month of your application and in subsequent months, while your  application might be pending?  There's no question on the application that goes back and says:  Have you been low income for the last year?</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> If I could understand this, you know, because these -- these are really important questions. What you're saying is that in Medicare, we were looking at a program where, even if you had reached the cap for hospital care, there were many other kinds of medical care that one could access the insurance program for. You could access it for home health. You could access it for outpatient treatment. You could keep getting stuff from Medicare even though you had reached the cap on hospital care, is that correct?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> That's exactly right.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And we all know that health insurance works that way because we reach the cap on one thing and we keep on benefitting from our insurance on another thing, right? That's just the way insurance --</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Exactly, yes.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- health insurance works. But you're saying that, here, there's only this cash stream.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> There's only the monthly payments that one is getting.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> That's right.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Then the question is: Okay, well, what about these references to the annual -- you know, what  --what about these annual measures?  Aren't you sort of in the program for a year even though you're not getting payment for particular months?  Right?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and there are those references in the statute. What are they there for?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> So they are in Section 1383, which is captioned ""Procedures for Payments.""  They are administrative housekeeping provisions. One says you are in SSA's  administrative database for a year, until you're -- you've been ineligible for 12 straight months. That provision was added 14 years after the statute was enacted. It was added in 1986. And it was simply meant to codify SSA's existing administrative practice of removing people from the database. It wasn't meant to change the fundamental scope of the entitlement under Section 1382.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And the fact that you don't have to apply  -- I mean, this is a very -- reapply for, you know, 12 months' time, this is a pretty sensible provision from everybody's perspective, right?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Because the  -- Congress knew that people were going to come in and out. Some months they were going to be above the threshold. Some months they were going to be below the threshold. So some months they were going to get monthly benefits and some months they weren't. But to have everybody reapplying every month as that happened didn't make sense for anybody. It didn't make sense for the people  who were giving the benefits, and it didn't make sense for the people who were receiving the benefits.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> That's exactly right. And I just  --just to focus on Section (j)(1) of 1383, I think this is an important textual point. It refers to those 12 months as months of ineligibility. So, under Petitioners' view, a person is both eligible for the program, eligible for benefits, and ineligib le for benefits in the same month.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Well --</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> And I think that's not a coherent reading of this statute.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- may I pursue that just a little bit?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> You mentioned 1383. And one of the provisions in 1383, Mr. McDowell, concerns the ability of SSA to secure financial records, and it says that it continues ""until the cessation of the recipient's eligibility of benefits.""  Doesn't that suggest that eligibility for benefits doesn't fluctuate from month to month?  Because, otherwise, SSA, I suppose, wouldn't be able to access a recipient's records for the months in which his income goes above the threshold.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> So that is the only term  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I -- I -- I know. That's why I'm picking --</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> -- it's the only reference in the statute.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- I'm picking the hardest one for you.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> And -- and -- and what SSA has said i s that we're going to read this in a beneficiary-friendly way. We're going to look to  -- we're going to say beneficiaries only have to re-authorize  --or authorize at the outset because, if they had to reauthorize every single month, they would lose benefits if they forgot to reauthorize in a particular month. It's an application essentially of utility error, which is -- which says that the  -- the canon of consistent usage will yield where the result would be unworkable. That's what SSA has said as to this particular provision. But everywhere else in the statute,  it reads ""eligibility"" to be month-to-month payment eligibility.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> But, here, it doesn't mean that. It means the 12 months.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Only because the result would be unworkable and bad for everybody, including beneficiaries, so it has taken that one isolated interpretation out.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Just two more quick questions. One, the D.C. Circuit, in places, seemed to adopt an actual receipt rule, which you have disavowed. Would an affirm, in your view, be the appropriate  --that's what your brief asks us to do, is affirm. Is that the appropriate remedy given some of the language in the D.C. Circuit opinion talking about actual receipt?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Your Honor, in the relevant portion of the opinion analyzing the question presented here, the D.C. Circuit says: HHS reads the provision to cover only Medic are beneficiaries who are entitled to SSI cash payments at the time of their hospitalization. That's at Pet. App. 9. That's exactly our position. Judge Katsas absolutely  understood our position, went through the arguments, and adopted the correct reading. He did not think that we were applying an actual receipt rule.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right. And then if you could address the concern that some of the amici have raised about what this would mean to rural and urban hospitals.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Yes. So we  -- we understand the DSH payments are critical to hospitals. And we provide billions of dollars in DSH payments each year. In 2024, it was approximately 9.2 billion for hospitals under this program, under DSH. And what the Court said, though, in Empire Health is that the point of the DSH provision is not to provide the most money possible to hospitals. It's to compensate hospitals for serving a disproportionate share of low -income patients. And we don't think that the statute authorizes us to provide any more DSH payments. We think that the statutory text unambiguously  prevents us from putting out more DSH payments under this provision.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can you help me to understand why you think that there aren't threshold eligibility criteria in this statute?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You pointed to 1383. But what about 1381a and 1382a, both of which seem to be pointing to age, blindness, and disability as threshold criteria, in addition to income?  And if that's the case, I'm wondering why those aren't the kinds of things that  one -- the government assesses at the outcome to determine your eligibility for the program, and then they may do the monthly assessment of income pursuant to the rest of the statute.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> We assess those things at the outset, but we also reassess them every month. It just so happens that someone can't age backwards. So, of course, we don't go back and  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right. But what about disability?  Each application  -- every monthly application, when you call up and you say, please give me the check, I've fallen out one month, do -- do they reassess your disability status?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> The statute gives SSA discretion to determine when to make these reevaluations.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no, I'm not asking discretion. I'm asking:  What does the government do?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> In  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Because it seems to me that if the government does not reassess the threshold criteria of disability, then you're in the program based on the government's initial disability determination, correct?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> I disagree, Your Honor, because we don't reassess disability every single month. We do do periodic reassessments. But, still, the entitlement is a month-to-month entitlement because the entitlement is not based solely on --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, I understand the payment is made on a month -to-month basis, but you make the payment only to the category of people who also meet age and disability criteria that you assess only at the beginning.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> But --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So what I'm asking you is:  Isn't that initial assessment the same kind of thing as the threshold determination that happens in most benefit programs, and then you're in the program and then the monthly assessment occurs to give you the benefit or not?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> No, Your Honor, because, with respect to Medicare Part A, you get into the program by being 65. Then you're in, and you get access to all of the benefits from the threshold. Here, just because you're disabled in the first month does not mean that you are into a program. You still have to show every single month that your income is below the income limit. And just to point to Section 1381a, that  --that text refers to a determination of eligibility on the basis of income and resources.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes, and then 82t  --</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> That is a monthly --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- excuse me, then 1382a is set up to look at the income and resources, and then it says, ""shall be an eligible individual.""  It seems to me very clear that the statute is set up to make a threshold determination of who is eligible on the basis of income and resources given those provisions that I just outlined.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Your Honor, I disagree. And just to point you to 3 -- 1382b(1), that also refers to the benefit amount at -- in terms of an annual rate.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes, but that's in procedure. That's all -- we've already determined --</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> 1382b  -- b --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Excuse me.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> -- 1382b(1).</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I see. Sorry.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Yes. So that's at 5A of the statutory appendix to our brief.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> That is talking about a rate of the amount of benefits for the calendar year. And everyone agrees that SSA does not have to pay benefits annually. It has always been converted into a monthly amount. And  Petitioners on page 7 of their opening brief concede that that has to be done because subsection (c)(1) requires a monthly payment eligibility determination. (c)(1) is the determination. It's the only determination in the statute. That's the determination that is referenced in 1381a when it talks about determine eligibility on the basis of resources. It points you to (c)(1). And if you look at (c)(1), which is at 6A of the appendix to our brief, it says ""an individual's eligibility for a benefit"" --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I'm sorry, how -- how can you get to (c)?  1382a  -- 1382, (1) says, right, you make a determination of their eligibility on the basis of income and resources. Then, when you get to 1382a, which is the next provision, it says ""eligible individual defined,"" and it is set up to make the determination on the basis of income an d resources.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Your Honor, that income metric is converted into a month-to-month limit.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, I understand.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> It's -- okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Right. Right. So there's  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I'm just saying, but isn't 1382a relevant to the determination of who is an eligible individual?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> It is relevant to the income -- to the income criterion, yes, that is relevant. What I'm saying is it's converted into a monthly limit because this whole statute is inherently month to month. It's designed as a month-to-month statute.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> On the question of insurance, I think in your briefs, a lot of your argument  --maybe not a lot -- but some turned on this is not insurance. And you heard what your friend on the other side said in response 71 to that, that this really functions just like insurance.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Yeah, I would make a few points about that. The first is, as a textual matter, Congress expressly referred to Medicare Part A as insurance. It did that in 42  U.S.C. 426 and 42 U.S.C. 1395c. It never called SSI insurance. And I don't think SSI functions like an insurance program in two particular ways. First, insurance, as the Court explained in Empire Health, is  --it's very natural to talk about the entitlement to insuranc e as being separate and apart from the right to payment because you're still entitled to insurance even if your policy doesn't pay for a particular medical service. Here, everything turns on the right to payment. And then the second difference is that, with SSI, it doesn't insure you against future risks. You can't successfully apply for SSI until you are already low income, whereas, with Medicare Part A, you get in automatically when you're 65 and then it protects you, insures you against any future healthcare expenses -- thereafter.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> What about the disability in Medicare?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> The disability in Medicare is  -- is a little bit different, but the Court in that case relied on the fact that</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> If you're under 65 and disabled, that's  --you apply, right?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> That's right. But the Court in  --in Empire Health specifically said that the entitlement to Medicare Part A is automatic. And the reason why it said that is because the vast majority of Medicare beneficiaries are  -- are getting it because they're over 65, and so  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I think that the -- Ms. Sherry's idea for how this is insurance -- and she'll correct me if I'm wrong  -- but the -- the idea is that even if you run over the threshold in a particular month, that you know that you're going to get the benefit in the next month when you go under the threshold, even without a reapplication. So the insurance, which she said really -- isn't really insurance; it's sort of assurance  -- is that I have an assurance for a period of a year that I won't have to reapply when I go under the threshold again. So what should we make of that?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> So I agree that you don't have to submit a new application, but you will be subject to another determination. You'll have to tell them when you become ineligible. They'll have -- then you'll have to tell them when you think you're going to be eligible again. And they're going to take another look at it. You don't have to submit a paper application again, but there is another determination. In Medicare Part A, there's just the threshold eligibility determination, and then you're in the program and you get access to this wide array of benefits. So it's quite different.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> On the consequences that Ms. Sher ry talked about for the hospitals, are you saying those are -- as a factual matter, you disagree with the predictive judgment in the amicus brief and in the Petitioners'?  Or are you saying, yeah,  hospitals could close, but that's the nature of a program and the limited resources?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Well, Justice Kavanaugh, it's -- it's not as if -- this has been the longstanding position. This has been  the position since 1986. So it's not as if how the Court decides this case is going to necessarily change the status quo if it agrees with us. It just will be maintaining the status quo. So -- and then, as to some of the arguments in the amicus briefs, they point to the 340B drug pricing program as kind of another potential harm here, but they don't  -- they -- they don't fully explain the fact that hospitals will have -- do have other pathways of getting into that program. It's not just based on the DSH percentage.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I think there are three things. You might not qualify for DSH at all. If you do qualify  -- because of the cutoff, the 15 percent. If you do qualify, the benefits might be less. And you might not qualify for 340B. Those are the three buckets of things, right?</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> So I don't disagree as a factual matter that if you don't qualify for  the 15 percent, that you're not part of the DSH payment program. But I will say that one thing  that is important is that the ACA has already changed the status quo here because it has reduced  -- it's diminished the importance of this Medicare fraction formula already because  now, for a hospital's DSH payment, 25 percent is based on this formula, where previously it was a hundred percent. And now it's 25 percent. And 75 percent is based on the rate of uncompensated care, which is a totally different metric.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I think your answer then is their predictive judgment's wrong because this is the way it's been. Is that  --</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> That -- that's essentially correct. And I will say that I -- they  --they put out a $1.5 billion number in their cert petition on page 18. They don't explain how they get to that number. They don't</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, they say you're not giving them the data to figure it out. So that's --</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> Well, Your Honor, the D.C. --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- a little rich from their perspective. Yeah.</text><speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text> -- the D.C. Circuit already considered that argument and rejected it, and it's not before the Court. And I -- I'm happy to speak to that data issue. I mean, I think --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> That's okay. That's probably too in the weeds, yeah.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you -- thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito? Justice Gorsuch, anything further? Okay. All right. Justice Jackson? Thank you, counsel.

Congress responded by changing the statute. It directed the Veterans Court to take  due account of the Secretary's application of Section 5107(b), the benefit-of-the -doubt statute, and that new statutory command, unique in administrative review, directed to a specialized Article I tribunal reviewing a uniquely pro-claimant agency process, must be given effect. Petitioners have provided an account of Section 7261(b)(1)'s plain text that gives effect to all parts of the statute and allows for the meaningful and independent judicial scrutiny that Congress intended. Yet the government insists that the statute not only requires nothing that wasn't already required by Section (a) before 2002 but also requires the one thing we know Congress didn't want. Under its view, the Veterans Court does not even look at the agency's benefit-of-the -doubt rulings unless a -- so long as no factual finding specifically challenged by the veteran is infected with clear error.

And, if  upheld, they will allow the agency's non-compliance with its statutory mandate to continue unchecked. I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Would you spend a minute or so explaining how your approach would  work in comparison to the government's approach?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Certainly, Your Honor. So our view of the statute starts with the text. So the text is ""in making the determinations under subsection (a).""  What are the determinations that the Veterans Court makes under subsection (a)?  It is looking at the particular aspects of the agency's order that are challenged on appeal, so deciding whether to affirm, reverse, or vacate those decisions. That's the determinations under subsection (a). In making those determinations, just like the Veterans Court, if it's otherwise inclined to reverse or vacate, under (b)(2), it has to do a  --a -- a check to make sure that the  -- any error was, in fact, prejudicial. Under (b)(1), if it's otherwise inclined to  affirm, it nonetheless has to do a check and make sure that the decisions that it is about to affirm complied with the  --with Section 5107(b). That is the benefit-of-the-doubt statute. And the benefit-of-the-doubt statute, in turn, has two mandatory requirements. It requires the VA to consider all medical and lay evidence and information relevant to the -- the issue, and then it requires, if there's an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue, that the veteran receives the benefit of the doubt.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> But  --</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> So our view is --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Thank you, Your Honor. Our view is that this is something the Veterans Court has to do in every case, that it is not bound by party presentation, and that it is a non-deferential review.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> But it's a pretty unusual law, right?  It says that the administration shall take account of, take due account of. It -- it doesn't seem that they're changing the legal standard at all. It just says sort of be more careful. And to take from that instruction some change in the legal standard of review, I think, is  -- is quite a leap.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> So we don't think that it was -- was changing what the standard of review should have been. That's clear, for  example, as to -- to any aspect of the Secretary's application of Section 5107(b) that presents a legal question. The government agrees with us that there are at least some of those. As to this approximate balance piece, our view is that the Veterans Court, as it recognized in its  --its Gilbert decision, was supposed to be reviewing that as a matter of law all along. It wasn't doing that. It was doing this narrow clear-error review. And so Congress came back and, you know, it thought about, well, should we just change the -- the standard of review for factual issues?  No. Why not? Because that wouldn't fix the problem. Instead, they  --they took this more direct approach. It is unique, Your Honor. This is a -- this is a unique court reviewing, you know, one uniquely pro -claimant system. So it makes sense that Congress would do something sort of sui generis here.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can you be a little bit more specific when you say it was supposed to be -- the court, the Veterans Court, was supposed to be doing that all along?  What  exactly is the ""that""?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> So the  --the ""that,"" I think it's most helpful if -- if we look at Section 5107, and that is at Pet. App. 93a. So -- so, again, Section 5107(b) has these two requirements. It obligates the agency to consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record, and when there is an approximate balance of positive and neg ative evidence on any material issue, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. Our view is that before 2002, under subsection (a) of Section 7261, if a veteran presented an argument that the Secretary had not complied with this statute, the Veterans Court was supposed to be doing that. It was. As to this particular category of Section 5107(b) errors that is about the -- the review of was the evidence actually  in approximate balance, the Veterans Court was -- was only looking at whether there had been a clear error of fact and not whether -- having, you know, assessed the credibility of the evidence, the persuasiveness of any piece of  evidence, whether  -- and --and sort of put those on the evidentiary scales, whether the Veterans Court had correctly judged if there was an approximate balance or --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And you say no -- and you say no deference should be given to the Veterans  --to the administration, to the agency, with making that determination?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> That's correct. That is a question about whether  -- it's a legal conclusion about the state of the evidentiary record, was it sufficient to meet the applicable standard of proof. Here, you have this kind of unique standard of proof,  approximate balance, but like other standards of proof, the court should be reviewing it de novo.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Wouldn't you expect that Congress, if they thought that the  standard of review was wrong, instead of saying take due account, would have said review de novo?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> That might have been a clearer way to indicate this, but I -- I think what is clear is that Congress put this in a -- an entirely new separate provision. They didn't simply adjust the  -- the standard of review for facts. We think that that's right because this isn't a factual question. And  --and what they did was they took a part of the statute that was already there. (b)(2) had already said take due account of the role of prejudi cial error.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, how could this not be a factual question?  I mean, I could understand it if you were looking at a decision by the Sec retary or the Board where they completely ignored the benefit -of -the-doubt rule or where  --or where they gave the benefit of the doubt to the wrong party. Then I can see your saying, well, look, they made a legal error and that's subject to de novo review. But assume that they do that. Assume that they just say, you know, we don't -- we don't see that this case is in equipoise, so we're not giving the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. And then the court takes another look at it. I would think that what the court is doing is to evaluate how the Board has evaluated evidence, weighed evidence, contrasted one party's evidence with another party's evidence, decided which is the more credible. All of that sounds like typical factual issues, factual determinations.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> So there -- there are certainly factual determinations underlying it, and we agree that  --that the -- the Board's assessment of -- of credibility or -- or persuasive value or probative value to any given piece of evidence should be reviewed deferentially, just like it is in other sufficiency-of-the -evidence challenges. But the ultimate question that contrasts between the party's evidence, that question is  --is traditionally reviewed as a question of law. And we think the same would apply here. And I -- I can give Your Honor an example  of when there might be, for example, no clear error but, nonetheless, a legal error in applying the approximate balance standard. If -- if the -- and this is a simplified example, but if the agency has before it two medical opinions. Let's say the -- the question is, is the veteran's disabling pain linked to a gunshot wound that he received in service. There is one medical opinion that says it is, one medical opinion that says it's not. The agency says:  Both of these are credible and probative, but, nonetheless, we're going to go with the opinion that says no nexus. That wouldn't meet the clear-error standard of review, right, because, under clear error, if there's two permissible views of the evidence, it can't be a clear error. But it would be, in our view, a violation of the approximate balance standard of proof. You have two competing opinions that the agency has credited. You'd think that stands in approximate balance. And that's the kind of judgment that --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I'm sorry.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> No, I don't understand that at  -- at all because, if the administration said the evidence is completely in equipoise, then they would have to find in favor of whichever party did not have the burden of proof on that question. And it -- sure, it would be a legal error if one party has -- you know, one party has the obligation to prove a fact by that fact, you know, whether there's a linkage by a preponderance of the evidence. If the -- if the court or the administration doesn't heed where the burden of proof has been allocated, then, yes, that's legal error. But, if they find  -- they say that the  -- a particular burden of proof has been satisfied or has not been satisfied on a question of fact, and then there's an appeal, the appellate court determines whether it was clear error to apply the applicable burden of proof in the way that is necessary in that situation. So I don't see any incompatibility. If we view the burden  -- the -- the benefit-of-the -doubt rule as equivalent to the allocation of the burden of  -- of proof on --on a certain issue, I don't see any incompatibility between that and ultimate clear-error review.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> So I -- I think the example I gave is  -- is an instance in which the  -- the Veterans Court would find no clear error because there is a plausible basis for finding a lack of nexus if you have one, you know, credible medical opinion in the record that says that. But there's, nonetheless, a failure to apply the approximate balance standard of proof. I do want to be clear that we --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> No, I think it would be a  --it w ould be a mistake, it would be a legal error if they said, we're disregarding the fact that the claimant was entitled to the -- the benefit of the doubt in the proceeding before the administration. That would be a mistake in applying the applicable law. But, if they apply the applicable law, then what is the problem with reviewing the finding under the clear-error standard?  Do you agree that that would be appropriate?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> I  -- I think that the finding is reviewed for clear error, but the application of the standard of proof is reviewed de novo. This is how sufficiency of the evidence works. An example would be a -- a judge reviewing a  -- a motion for judgment as a matter of law. There's a measure of deference in there  to things like credibility and persuasion. In the JMOL context, it's  -- it's built in through inferences. Here, it would be based on the explanation that the agency has given about its credibility judgments and persuasive judgments, which the agency is required to provide in its opinion under the reasons-and-bases requirement. But the ultimate question, just like in JMOL:  Was the evidence sufficient to meet that standard of proof -- whether it's preponderance or clear and convincing in the civil context; here, it's approximate balance  -- was the evidence sufficient  -- you know, did the veteran present sufficient evidence to get into that approximate balance, or was the agency, instead, correct to find itself persuaded against the veteran?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counsel, it  -- it's very rare -- and I think Justice Alito is right. If the agency simply says both sides are  credible, I'm going to pick B, and stops there, that's legal error because they have not -- the -- the rule says you have to give the benefit of the doubt to the plaintiff, and if they say everything's equal, they've committed legal error because it's in equipoise. What actually happens, however, is that the AIJ does a whole set of credibility determinations to support the conclusion of why they're going to believe one side or another. They're going to look at the expert they believe or  -- and say:  That expert had more information. That expert was more precise about A, B, and C. The other expert didn't know this fact. I think that's, in fact, what happened in one of these cases. And they give a whole set of reasons as to why they're disbelieving one expert or not accepting one expert over the other. So let's get to that point. That, to me, is a mixed question of law and fact.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> I think you could look at it as a mixed question of law and fact. We think that the -- the sufficiency-of-the- evidence standards are -- are more of a helpful analog. But, if you look at it under the mixed question test, this is surely a predominantly legal question that would be reviewed  non-deferentially. So it's  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's done in almost -- in so few areas of law, most of them constitutional. Like, is there probable cause? I  -- I don't know of any other area of civil law where we view mixed questions of law and fact as predominantly legal.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> And I would say this is a  -- a unique area of law, right?  It has a uniquely generous standard that is unlike anything else that applies in civil litigation. So having a unique standard of review  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we go back to Justice Kavanaugh's question, which is due account  --</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- seems to me not to include a standard of review. They knew how  to say it's a matter of law or it's a matter of fact and what standard of review applied, and they didn't use those words.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> But they didn't use ""clear error"" either. And they didn't put it under (a)(4), which is the standard of review  for facts. I think that's a clear recognition that this is not a factual question or at least not purely a factual question. To take --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But there are components that are factual and components that are legal, and we  -- they take due consideration of the standard of review that applies to each.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> But just because something involves facts doesn't mean that the ultimate question is  --is a question of fact. There are many tests. I think, in the intellectual property context, we have something like obviousness in patent law or fair use in copyright law. Those tests are both based on subsidiary factual findings that are reviewed deferentially. The ultimate conclusion is reviewed as a matter of law. So I don't think  this is so unusual.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But I think  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What happens  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Bostwick, can I  -- can I ask you just about the scope of your argument for a moment?  You say that the Veterans Court must consider this sua sponte in every case, but both of your clients did raise the benefit-of-the -doubt argument. So why should we even reach that question?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> For a couple reasons, Your Honor. First, because it -- it matters to address the ""when presented"" language in order to actually give effect to Congress's text and not make it duplicative of what's already required under subsection (a). But I would say also that it matters concretely to these Petitioners. I think that the clearest example is the fact that Mr. Thornton had two claims that the agency resolved against him. One was his rating for PTSD, as to which he did raise the benefit-of-the -doubt argument to the Veterans Court. The other was his rating for his undiagnosed illness, as to which he did not raise a  --specifically raise a benefit-of-the -doubt error to the Veterans Court. Under our view, because he raised other challenges to that rating denial, the Veterans Court would have to look at -- have to perform its (b)(1) review as to that claim as well.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Well, I do have one quick question about Mr. Thornton. Since he did receive benefits, I just don't understand exactly what he stands to gain because, because of his unemployability, wasn't he given complete disability?  So what further relief could he get if he wins before us?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes, Your Honor. So his total disability based on individual unemployability, because of his age, it's not a permanent benefit. He is subject to continual review on that. So even though he is receiving a hundred  -- benefits at the hundred percent level right now, that could change in the future. So the rating for his individual conditions is important. He also may be in a situation where he would be entitled to special monthly compensation, which goes above the hundred percent level.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I'd like to follow up on -- on -- on Justice Barrett's question, Ms. Bostwick. The party presentation question wasn't really squarely addressed in either of the lower court opinions, and I wonder whether we should, as a court of review rather than first view, give them the chance to tackle that first and just address the question of, when it is presented, must -- must it be interpreted the way you  -- you --you propose? What do you think of that?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> So, respectfully, Your Honor, I  --I disagree. I do think the Federal Circuit  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I know you disagree.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> -- resolved this question. I --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I -- I -- I know that, but would you object to a partial win  rather than a complete one, counsel?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> I'm certainly not going to object, Your Honor, but I would point the Court to Pet. App. 9a in the Bufkin opinion, where it relies on the ""when presented"" language to say that  -- that arguments that are -- are benefit-of-the -doubt errors that are not raised to the Veterans Court don't have to be addressed, so --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And I understand there's language in  -- in some of the Federal Circuit opinions that suggests that they do (a) review -- sorry, (b)(2) review, that is, the prejudicial error review, even when it isn't presented, which is a little odd, but  --and I understand that you want your -- your provision interpreted in pare materia with that, but I just wonder whether, as a first bite, we should just tackle the narrow question that is squarely presented.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> It would certainly be -- be helpful for the Court to -- to address any -- any of these questions. We do think the -- the ""when presented"" piece is an important part of giving the statute effect, but if it -- if the Court wanted to leave that for the Federal  Circuit to consider with the benefit of the Court's other guidance, that would be fine. I do -- again, I think that this language at Pet. App. 9a  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> 9a. I've got that. I've got that note. And then, separately, there's been some discussion about the ""take due account of"" language, and I -- I'm certainly sympathetic to that point. But (b)(2), the ""take due account of the rule of prejudicial error,"" courts -- it seems to be a given between the courts and both sides here that that means that the reviewing court will conduct a harmless error review.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And it looks at the record given  --given what's not clearly erroneous. It takes those facts as  given and then does a de novo legal analysis and decides whether the  -- the --the error which is found would have been -- made a difference in the outcome of the case.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And you're asking (b)(1) to be interpreted in the same manner?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes, for -- for two reasons. They're subject to the same language, and  -- and two pieces of language are important. One is that subsection (b), unlike subsection (a), the Veterans Court is directed to make these determinations on  -- based on a review of the record of proceedings before the Secretary and the Board. That's a comprehensive review, as this Court recognized in Sanders when addressing (b)(2). And also the -- the words ""take due account,"" right?  What  -- to take due account of something is  --what  --what account is due will depend on the thing being taken account of. In the prejudicial error context, it was, okay, let's do it the same way we do in the A PA. Here, what are we dealing with?  We're dealing with the Secretary's application of Section 510(c), a mandatory statute that binds the agency with not one but two ""shall"" commands. A reviewing court takes due account of that by looking at whether the agency complied with its obligations, and the piece of that, the approximate balance piece of that that  sets out the standard of proof, reviewing courts look at the  -- the standard of proof as a matter of law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Are you  -- are you just asking for another line in the opinion saying our conclusions take due account of what it's supposed to, and then that's -- because, I  mean, your friend on the other side says that this really doesn't add anything. And you seem to be saying no, they have to look at this and this. So what -- I mean, I know you want a different result in this case, but in terms of the analysis, what are you looking for?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yeah, I -- I don't think going from one rubber stamp to another system would  --would be helpful here. We think that this is a meaningful analysis that the Veterans Court must perform. I'll give you an example of what the Veterans Court shouldn't be doing, which is at Pet. App. 43a in Mr. Thornton's case. Mr. Thornton, again, yes, he raised a benefit-of-the -doubt challenge, but, nonetheless, the Veterans Court said that the -- the agency's conclusion  -- the outcome of the agency's approximate balance analysis is a factual finding. And because Mr. Thornton had said, I'm not challenging factual findings, I'm  making a legal argument, the Veterans Court said we don't have to do anything. Thus, he has not shown error in the Board's application of  Section 5107(b). That certainly can't be right. Whatever precise level of deference or scrutiny the  -- that is appropriate to take due account of the Secretary's application of this statute, it has to be some meaningful review. And that's the purpose of the Veterans Court, right, is to  --to superintend this one agency. If the Veterans Court is meaningfully looking at this benefit-of-the -doubt rule, then we will get a developed law. What does approximate balance mean?  How does it apply in different cases?  We will get uniformity, which we don't have now. I would point the Court to page 9 of the DAV amicus brief, where it talks about examples of veterans from -- who served on Eglin Air Force base, where the government concedes it used toxic herbicides. You have veterans with  identical records, some of them being given the benefit of the doubt and others not. That -- that is the kind of legal error that the Veterans Court should be supervising and should be preventing by -- by doing an actual meaningful review of this statute.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And should be because, you say, Congress intended that. I mean, I  -- I understood from your argument that Congress came back and put (b)(1) into the statute, which suggests that it intended that it do some work, I would think.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes, Your Honor, that it do some work. And we think the  -- you know, Congress putting it in subsection (b), where it's something that applies in every case and -- and isn't bound to the specific arguments that the parties raise and is based on a review of the record, is indicative of the importance of this issue. I think it also is important for the Court to bear in mind the number of veterans who appear pro se even at the Veterans Court. There were more than 1100 of them last year alone. And, certainly, those veterans, you know, they may not know to raise a specific articulation of a  -- a 5107(b) error, but they know something went wrong. And what Congress is telling the Veterans Court is you have to look. It's the  Veterans Court's obligation to take due account of the agency's compliance.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And going back to Justice Gorsuch's point, we do see parallel language between (b)(1) and (b)(2), so I just want to be clear that (b)(2) does have this sort of separate obligation, is that right, by the court?  In other words, (b)  -- sorry, Chief.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> No, no, you can finish.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> (b)(2) doesn't require sort of a threshold analysis of legal error versus factual error or whatnot. Everyone agrees that when the statute says take due account, the court operates, as Justice Gorsuch suggests, to just determine whether there is a harmless error under these circumstances.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes. And under the Federal Circuit's Tadlock ruling and others,  that is a mandatory obligation on the court.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Let me just pursue for a second the example that you gave earlier in your argument about a hypothetical case in which there are two experts who testify on the question of the linkage between the disability and service. And let's say in that situation the  -- the Veterans Administration finds that even taking into  -- even giving the claimant the benefit of the doubt, the expert who says that there is no linkage is more persuasive, okay?  Now that finding would be dispositive of the claim for benefits, would it not?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> I  -- I don't mean to -- to be difficult, but I would say it depends on the circumstances because the test is not  -- again, the test isn't equipoise and the test isn't, you know, has one person persuaded more than the other. It is an approximate balance assessment.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Right. They say: Taking into account the approximate balance, the approximate balance is not in favor of the claimant, it is against the claimant, all right? So that is a finding. And let's assume it's dispositive of the  -- of the claim for benefits. And then there is  -- then there is a review in the Veterans Court. Is it your argument that the finding of fact as to which expert is more credible is subject to de novo review or clear-error review?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> No, that aspect is subject to clear -error review.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> And then what is subject to de novo review?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> The judgment of taking all of the evidence, right?  It's -- it's rare that there's going to be just these two pieces of evidence and it's so clear how they balance out. Taking all -- into account all of the lay and medical evidence relevant to the issue, was the evidence in approximate balance, or did it persuasively favor one side or the other?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, let's say that there is a finding of fact on every piece of evidence, and on all of these pieces of evidence, the finding of fact is that, even  giving the claimant the benefit of the doubt, the fact has not been proved. Then what is the standard of review before the Veterans Court?  Do you say that -- that that is  --although each of them is subject to clear error -- each of these findings is subject to clear -error review, when you put it all together, that is a question of law that is subject to de novo review?  Is that your argument?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Why wouldn't that apply in  --in every civil bench trial?  The question of whether the  -- the -- the -- the judge erred in rejecting a particular civil claim, that would be a -- in your view, that's a -- that's a question of law?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> If  --if there's a motion that the -- if there's -- if the challenge is not to any factual finding but just to the sufficiency of the evidence, that is a -- a question of law, as -- as this Court --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> But it takes into account the  -- the findings on all the subsidiary facts?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes. And that's our view of how this works as well, Your Honor.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> What is the difference between (b)(1) and (b)(2)?  (b)(2) says:  Take due account of the rule of prejudicial error. And that's because the Secretary doesn't do that, correct?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Correct, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So it's only the  -- it's the Veterans Court that has to do that because it's the only one charged with doing it?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right. So it has to apply it. But (1) says:  Take due account of the Secretary's obligation  -- application of Section 5107(b). That's substantially different. It's asking a -- it's asking them to review what someone else has done, correct?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes, Your Honor. It's  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And so that comes -- may come to a different standard of review, correct?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> It could. And  -- and so we have to look further at what is the -- the Secretary's application of 5107(b).</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> My point is only that (b) doesn't really tell us much.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> I don't think it  --it answers the  -- the question, no, Your Honor.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan?</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I just want to make sure I understand. Do you agree with the description of the benefit-of-the -doubt rule, that it's essentially just a change in the burden of proof, right?  Usually, a claimant comes in and he has to meet a 51 percent burden. And what the benefit-of-the -doubt rule does is to sa y:  No, if you meet 50 percent, you win, and maybe even a little bit more because it's an approximate balance. So maybe, if you go 49 percent, you win. But that's what this rule is. It's just a shift in the burden of proof?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes. I'd say it's -- it's a different burden of proof. And I do want to be clear it is not a 50 percent rule. It is not a preponderance rule. The Federal Circuit has rejected that. It is broader than that.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Okay. So it's in the  --right. Like, even if you don't get up to 50 percent, maybe because we find that there is an approximate balance, you still win. But that's just a -- a -- a -- that's just another way of shifting the burden of proof. That's what this rule is?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yeah. It's also  -- the burden remains on the claimant, but the level of the burden they have to  -- the threshold they have to meet is different. It sort of creates three zones:  persuasively favoring the veteran, the veteran wins; persuasively against the veteran, the veteran loses on that issue; and then this middle zone of approximate balance. It would chase that.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Yeah. So why isn't  -- the way we usually do this -- it's like usu ally, in, like, a totally factual case, where you have all these subsidiary factual findings and then you have a question of whose facts weigh more heavily, whose facts are more credible, and we usually think about that as, like, was it clear error to find that the claimant didn't meet his 51 percent burden of proof?  Now we just say:  Is it clear error to find that the plaintiff didn't meet his slightly less stringent burden of proof?  But it's still clear error.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> I  -- I don't think so, Your Honor. Again, I think, when you're judging the sufficiency of the evidence to meet whatever the applicable standard of proof is, I mean, this case -- this Court's case in -- in Reeves, in Weisgram, talks about that. And then, of course, in the criminal context with probable cause, it -- it -- it talks about that as  an ultimate question of law.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Okay. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Gorsuch?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Let me see if I've got it, and I may not, Ms. Bostwick. So, in -- in a normal civil case, for example, we  -- we look at all -- a reviewing court will look at all of the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> We take those facts and then we do a legal analysis to see if they're sufficient as a matter of law to support the verdict rendered, and we do that de novo.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That -- that -- that's just what it is. Now that standard is: Could any reasonable juror come to this conclusion?  But that's the legal standard we ask based on the evidence that's given.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And you're here asking us essentially to say, take all the non-clearly erroneous facts and ask:  Was the Secretary's approximate  -- instead of a sufficiency line, whether the -- whether the Secretary's determination that they were not in approximate balance is correct?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And what's an approximate balance?  Nobody knows. But that's -- that's what -- what you were talking with Justice Kagan about. It's something less than 50 percent.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> It's -- the -- the way the Federal Circuit has described it in the -- the governing Lynch opinion is whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other or whether it's, instead, an approximate balance. And they have rejected the idea that  --that proof by a preponderance for the government is enough to get you out of approximate balance.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. So, to take your example of the two experts, let's say they're both  super well qualified and they both do a really good job. And one says: Service-related. The other says:  Not. The agency favors the one that's not because, hmm, he -- he interviewed the claimant more recently in time or ran one more test. And  --and that's not clearly erroneous because a clearly erroneous standard is very hard to meet.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right?  It's  --it's basically:  Were they crazy in -- in choosing  this one fact over the other fact?  And they were not crazy. So there's no clear error. But, as a matter of law, you would say, as  I understand your argument, that, hey, those are really pretty similar, and the Secretary's decision that it wasn't decisively in favor, I think is the language you used, or something like that, in favor of -- of -- of the government means that -- that this standard has teeth and should be applied?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. And in the same way that -- that the prejudicial error language works, we take all the non-clearly erroneous facts and say:  Okay, would this error have made any difference?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yes, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. I think I got it. Thank you.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Two things. I assume you don't want us to accept the premise that clearly erroneous is the same as crazy as a general proposition. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> The -- correct, Your Honor. The way the Veterans Court has articulated it is:  Is there a plausible basis?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And, second, can you quantify or try to quantify what approximate balance is?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> I think we're -- we're, in this case, not challenging the -- the Lynch decision, and so it is just:  Have you persuasively favored one side or the other?  Trying to put numbers on that --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Is that 35, 40, 45, 49?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> I think that's a question that -- that this Court doesn't have to resolve in this case. What we do know is that it's  --it's more than, you know, 51/49. It's broader than that difference.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So just a final point on this. You've said a couple of times that this area is involving a unique standard, and what I took you to mean is that the app roximate balance standard itself, the 5017(b) standard, is unique, but what you're asking of the Court, the rule that you would like to have applied here is very similar to what courts do when they evaluate sufficiency of the evidence, as you had in the dialogue with Justice Gorsuch. Is that what you're saying?  So we're not  --you're not asking for something new and different by the Court with respect to the assessment here?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> We don't view it as new and different, correct, Your Honor. It's just that the  --the -- you know, whereas, in a Rule 50 context, for example, you might be looking at the sufficiency of the evidence through a preponderance standard --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> -- this is a --a different test, this approximate balance.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But we're still doing the same -- qualitatively, same kind of review as a sufficiency-of-the -evidence review?</text><speaker>Melanie L. Bostwick</speaker><text> Analytically, we think it is the same, yes, Your Honor.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Mr. Joshi.</text>","<speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Veterans Court does not apply 5107(b) itself. It takes due account of the Secretary's application of it, and it does so in making the determinations under subsection (a). Those textual clues point to standard principles of judicial review of agency action. That is, the Veterans Cour t reviews legal aspects of the Secretary's application of 5107(b) de novo and factual aspects deferentially, here, for clear error. The Secretary's determination that all the evidence in the record on a particular issue is or is not an approximate balance is itself factual or predominantly factual and  so should be reviewed for clear error. Now what I heard my friend say this morning and the reason Petitioners resist that fairly obvious conclusion, I think, is because they observe that everything I just said could have been inferred from subsection (a) itself. And so that leaves subsection (b)(1) with no additional work to do. But, when Congress enacted (b)(1) in 2002, it took what was implicit or just generally covered in (a) and made it explicit and specific. It put an exclamation point on it. That's not nothing. Think of the Tenth Amendment, for example. But, even if you think that our interpretation renders (b)(1) largely redundant, it's still better than the alternative that Petitioners offer you. Petitioners say that the approximate balance finding should be reviewed de novo. But  that creates needless contradictions in the text. It conflicts with the express standard of review Congress supplied in (a)(4). It's in  serious tension with the prohibition on trial de novo in subsection (c). It's a real divergence from standard principles of judicial review generally and judicial review of agency decisions more specifically. And it's even inconsistent with the way other factual issues under (b)(1) are reviewed, as my friend mentioned this morning, like the in-service connection or existence of a disability. If Congress intended that highly irregular result, I think the language in (b)(1) is an awfully cryptic way of going about it. So, as between two interpretations, one that's sort of consistent, coherent, with a little bit of redundancy, and one that eliminates the redundancy at the cost of a statute at war with itself, I think you should pick the former over the latter. I'm sorry, I welcome the Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Veterans Court does not apply 5107(b) itself.

I think --</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> So what work is it doing?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> So I  -- I just want to be clear I am willing to accept that it's redundant but not that it does no work. It does work. It just does work that subsection (a)  generally, you could infer, also does. So it's doing duplicate work. It's not a nullity. So I know, you know, when there are statutory nullities, you should avoid those at all costs, but redundancy --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> What's the difference between a duplicative work and a redundancy?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Oh, no, there's no difference there. I'm drawing a distinction between that and a nullity, where a statute says do X, but we say it actually has no effect, you don't have to do X.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Well, no, that's very different.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Yea h.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I think Justice Thomas's question is, if (a) does all the work, what does (b) do?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Yeah. So I think --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> You say it's an exclamation point like the Tenth Amendment. I -- I hope you don't think the Tenth Amendment's a redundancy and a nullity.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> But put that aside.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Well, so, Justice Gorsuch, this Court in New York against United States said that the Tenth Amendment simply makes clear -- and this is quoting Justice Story -- simply makes clear what you would already do to address  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It makes  very clear what you do  --</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- already. And the -- 46 question is, is that what this does?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> I  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Are you suggesting this only --</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> I think so. And  let me give you just a little bit of history that is recounted in  --I think even in Petitioners' tale in the  -- the -- the -- the history they cite of the enactment. Veterans groups came to Congress and they said, look, you have given us  -- they didn't -- they weren't identifying some gap in the statute. They were saying, you gave us this lower standard of proof, whether it's 49, 50, 48, whatever it is, a lower standard of proof, but we're not getting the benefit of it and the Veterans Court isn't holding the Board to giving us the benefit of this thing. And so Congress, I think, reacted in a way you might expect when faced  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> -- with that problem, not</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right. But you just said that they came to Congress saying that the Veterans Court isn't giving the benefit of the rule. And  -- and I'm -- and I'm just wondering, after the law passed, I think you're still saying that the court doesn't have to do that.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It just does clear -- clear-error analysis.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Well, so there are a couple things there. Let -- let me first say I  think what the statute did was remind the Veterans Court of its preexisting obligation. And you  see that in the case law. So --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> What -- what obligation does it have?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> So the obligation is to  -- so let me give you an example, and I'm going to cite a couple cases in the Senate report, but I -- Congress was thinking about these cases. So Congress identified two cases as exemplary of what the Veterans Court was doing that it didn't like, that it thought was not honoring the statute it had already passed. They're called -- the two cases are cal led Ammons, I think, A-m-m-o-n-s, and Presley. And if you look at these cases, they -- 48 rejected factual challenges by the claimants, and they rejected it for having no plausible basis in the record. And there's just no  citation or mention of the benefit --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So that's clear error?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> They don't even mention  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> But that would be  -- that would fail  --</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- on clear-error standard, right?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> I'm sorry?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Those examples would fail for lack -- they would be clearly erroneous</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- factual findings, right?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> No. What -- what I'm saying is that those cases found no clear error without any recognition that it's a clear-error review against a standard of proof that is lower than a preponderance, right?  Standards of proof and standards of review are two different things, and you can mix and match. There's no -- you could have a high standard of proof, like clear and convincing, or a low one, like -- like this one here, but you can mix and match with de novo or deferential review. There  --there's no reason one compels the other. But --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Counsel  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Mister  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> -- I --I want to go back before you get off it. What other examples do you have of Congress passing a law that doesn't do anything?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> As I  -- so we cite a couple of cases in our brief involving statutes, O'Gilvie and Kawashima. You know, in O'Gilvie, there, you know, if you -- I don't want to delve too deep in it, but there was a statute that said damages in litigation about personal injuries are not taxable, you can exclude them from your income, and the question was, well, what about punitive damages because those aren't on account of your physical injury; they're on account of, you know, punishing the def endant or something. And the Court said, no, punitive damages are excluded. You have to count those as income. And the argument was made on the other side, well, wait a minute, Congress had passed a subsequent amendment saying that punitive  damages are excluded in personal injury cases for non-physical injuries, so like mental injuries. And they said, well, that statute  would be completely superfluous if punitive damages were not already included. And you said, well, it doesn't matter. We go with the reasonable test.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, but that seems to me that there's a legal determination and that the law that you're talking about sort of pointed the Court in the right direction. I mean, here, it was an eye-catching sentence in your brief for me when you said the amendment would serve a useful purpose even if it simply confirmed and emphasized a preexisting legal duty. Now this is not part of a complicated law where they wanted to say and we want you to do this. This was freestanding, right?  It said this is what you get in the veterans groups making a  --a fairly significant push to get this fixed from their point of view. And you say what they got was something that didn't do anything.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> I  --I -- I think it did have a good effect. So, to finish my answer to Justice Gorsuch, I mentioned the Ammons and Presley cases, which applied a clear-error standard with no recognition that the standard of proof against which it was measuring the clear error was lower than a preponderance. But then, shortly after the law was passed, there was a case, it's not discussed here, but it was discussed extensively in the Federal Circuit below in these cases, a case called Mariano from the Veterans Court, where it just looks completely different. It's still applying clear -error review, but it is actually reversing the --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> That's why  -- why -- yeah. Why are you accepting the premise that it didn't do anything?  It seems to me the way you're describing it, it did something important, which was describing the practice at least in some cases by the Veterans Court where they weren't separately analyzing it in light of the benefit-of-the -doubt rule and telling the Veterans Court you need to take due account of the benefit-of-the -doubt rule. That is accomplishing something. And, in fact, as you say, the proof's in the pudding, then the Veterans Court and the -- they're doing that, right?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> That's exactly right, Justice Kavanaugh.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Doesn't it depend on what the complaint  --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Oh, sorry. Go ahead.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- this  --so I guess I'm not sure why you so easily accept the premise. I mean, it seems to me it accomplished something important.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> I  --I agree completely. There are times I think Congress is free to pass a statute that reminds a court of its obligation if it feels that the court is not currently fulfilling the obligation that already exists.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I mean, it didn't just  --</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> It doesn't want to change the obligation.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Congress didn't just pass the same words.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Right, right.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Correct. And  -- and --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But doesn't -- doesn't it depend on the complaint that's being made, though?  I mean, that's why I think it's really important that we understand what the veterans were complaining about to begin with. If the sum total of the complaint was that the Veterans Court was completely ignoring the benefit-of-the -doubt rule, it never raised it, it didn't say anything about it, et cetera, then I suppose you could have an argument that a subsequent amendment that was designed to remind the Veterans Court that this obligation existed makes sense. But, if the complaint was maybe there are times when a court is completely ignoring it, but what we really are worried about is that we're not actually getting it, that they're saying benefit of the doubt or whatever, but then, when they're applying it, they are not actually giving us  --they're not evaluating whether the evidence is in equipoise properly; when it is in equipoise, they're not giving it to us. In that circumstance, if that was the complaint, it seems odd that Congress would just come back and point to the benefit-of-the-doubt rule as opposed to saying we need a court that's actually policing the extent to which the Veteran  --the administration is giving people what we said in 5017.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Right, Justice Jackson. So, as I  --as I read it and as I read it as Petitioners' account of it, it was that it was not  -- they were not complaining that there was some gap in the statute.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, not gap, meaning the gap in the statute would be we don't have the ability to bring this to the court's attention. We all agree that before, under the existing statute, under the existing circumstances, they could make a claim about the benefit-of-the -doubt rule. The question is, when Congress amended the statute to say something to the Veterans Court, weren't they  -- this is the other side's argument  --weren't they saying what we need you to do is to make sure that the agency is actually applying this consistent with the law?  And that's why it becomes, as Justice Gorsuch suggested, a legal question, because just like the sufficiency of the evidence is a  standard in the law and we want to make sure that the evidence is sufficient, here, Congress is saying you need to make sure, court, that when this comes to you, it's not just a deference to the agency, whatever they did with respect to benefit of the doubt, but you're actually making clear that they met the legal standard of giving the veteran what they're entitled to under this statute.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Okay. So there was a lot there. I would like  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes, I'm sorry.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> -- to address all of the pieces of it. Let me just start with sufficiency of the evidence because that's come up a lot in this morning's discussion. That is a deferential standard of review. Remember, a sufficiency -of-the- evidence challenge has a reviewing court looking at the fact finder's application of a legal standard to the facts. Fact finder in  sufficiency challenges would be the jury, right?  But the reviewing court, in reviewing a sufficiency motion, doesn't ask:  Did the jury  err in finding --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, I understand.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> --every element met beyond a reasonable doubt.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But isn't it a question of law?  It is a -- we  --we evaluate it as --</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> No, no. That  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- a question of law, don't we?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> No. That's my point. It's  --it's a deferential standard. It doesn't ask if the jury erred. It doesn't even ask if the jury clearly erred. It asks, did the  -- was the jury so out to lunch in finding each element met beyond a reasonable doubt because, in fact, -- -- there was no reasonable juror on the face of the earth who could have found every element beyond a reasonable doubt.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right. Right. But, counsel, I -- I --</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> It's the most deferential</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Sure. But it is a</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> -- standard of review I know.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- it is a -- it is a legal standard, though, isn't it?  Because we  --</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> No --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Just a second. Don't we take, when we do sufficient  -- I mean, maybe I'm just wrong, out to lunch, and I  --I welcome being corrected. But I -- I --I thought, when I used to do this a lot on the court of appeals, that I'd take all the facts in the light most favorable to the victor, those are the facts I've got to use, and then ask the legal question whether any reasonable juror could come to the conclusion this jury did. That's a legal question.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> It's a legal standard. Of course, it is.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. That's all. That's --</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> But it's a deferential standard.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Oh, sure it is. Yeah.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And the question  --</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> So that's all we're saying here, is the deferential standard is clear error.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> On  -- on the facts --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, but the clear error goes to the facts.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> --facts.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right. So the deference is baked into the  -- the acceptance of the facts. But then, once you have that bucket of non -clear-error facts, you're making a legal determination as to whether or not it satisfies the standard.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> So -- so there are multiple things going on here, but  -- but I agree that the -- that the -- that the approximate balance standard is a legal standard. Of course, it is. And you apply it to all of these historical facts that have been found:  the  expert evidence, the lay evidence, the medical evidence. That's the application of a legal standard to the facts in the record. That is a classic mixed question of law. And so then the question is:  How do you review -- how does a reviewing court review the fact finder's mixed question resolution?  And the answer there, which has been given in case after case  --Village at Lakeridge is probably a great example from a few terms ago  -- you ask:  Does answering that mixed question entail primarily factual work or primarily legal work?  And, here, it is clearly, I think, primarily factual. I mean, it says ""balance."" That means assigning weights to different evidence and then putting them on the scales and seeing how heavy they are.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So, Mister --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- can I ask, Mr. Joshi, how would you describe what the reviewing court -- how the reviewing court is supposed to take into account the benefit-of-the -doubt rule in  conducting its review?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Sure. So, for example, a claimant raises an injury or says:  I suffer from PTSD. And the Board rules against him and says:  You don't actually suffer from PTSD. What the Veterans Court will do on appeal is say:  All right, the standard of proof was little -- was lower than preponderance, and so we're going to ask:  Did the Board clearly err in finding -- well, the first step -- I should back up. It's the Secretary's application of 5107(b). The first part of 5107(b) says:  The Secretary has to take into account all the lay and medical evidence in the record. So the first thing the Court should do is say:  Did the Board actually take into account all the evidence?  If not, that's a legal error. You can reverse. Then you say:  Okay, it did take into account. Is the Board -- based on all of the evidence in the record, is the Board's conclusion that the claimant did not reach 48 or 49 --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Clear error.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> --is that clearly erroneous or not?</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So -- so, in the --in the usual case where a claimant has a 51 percent standard, you would say, did the Board clearly err in -- in deciding that the plaintiff did not meet his 51 percent standard?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Exactly.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And, in this case, you would ask the same question, except you would substitute for the 51 percent standard some lower standard, whatever it is --</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Exactly.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- 45, 35, whatever it is?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Exactly right.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you would ask the same question?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Exactly right.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And your  --if I understand the difference between you and Ms. Bostwick, Ms. Bostwick says, look  -- she accepts that all the individual facts should be reviewed only for clear error, right, so that, like, any particular factual matter is -- gets clear-error review, any particular factual determination. But this ultimate balance and the ultimate determination of whether the w eight of the evidence indicates that the plaintiff did or did not meet the standard is an entirely legal question. And the difference is you're saying it's not a legal question, that last bit, that that last bit is at  --is at most -- it's either a pure factual question or it's the kind of mixed question that U.S. Bank was talking  about when it talked about mixed questions that immerse courts in case -specific factual issues, compelling them to marshal and weigh evidence and make credibility judgments. Is that correct?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> It's exactly right. That's our position, and that's what we view as the critical difference between the two sides in this case.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> If that's the case, then what do we do about the fact that courts all the time do sufficiency-of-the -evidence review de novo based on the record, again, in the light most favorable?  And the -- the next section of (b) -- (b)(2) is the same  -- works the same way, I think, on your -- on your understanding as well, that the court, in deciding whether there's harmless error, takes all the non -clearly erroneous facts and asks de novo whether, as a matter of law, it would have made any difference, the -- the -- the error, that is.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> So let me answer both pieces of that question, Justice Gorsuch.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> First, I want to push back on the premise that sufficiency is -- it -- it is a legal standard, but it is a deferential standard of review.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> No, I understand. But it's a legal standard. And  --and harmless error is  --</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Yeah, but  ---</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- also a legal standard, isn't it?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Correct, it is a legal standard. But the point is the legal standard is applied to evaluate whether the fact finder erred in coming to some conclusion or not.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Here, the fact finder is the Board. Sufficiency would be the jury. But -- and then, as you go up further levels of appellate review, there's not cascading deference up the appellate chain. It's each reviewing court is reviewing the fact finder. And so I think, colloquially, we might say, oh, the Supreme Court reviews the court of appeals' sufficiency determinations de novo. Sure, we can say that colloquially.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> No, no, no. I'm talking  --</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> But, really, you're applying a deferential standard to the fact finder.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Again, I'm just, you know  --</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Yeah. The second -- the second piece was on (b)(2). I think I have two answers to that. Number one, what Justice Sotomayor said, which is that the court is applying prejudicial error. That's something only a court applies. And that's different from the  Secretary's application of (b)(1), which invokes principles of review of agency action. And so that's a difference. But I do think that -- so we disagree with Petitioners that the Federal Circuit thinks that the prejudicial error has to apply in every case. They cite this Tadlock case.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> No, I know.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> I've read the Tadlock case. It wasn't presented error at all.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Put that  -- put that  --put that aside.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> We normally read statutes in pari materia. And (b)(2) you agree is a  --is a de novo legal standard the Court has to apply when raised?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Yeah, that's right.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Does the approximate balance determination go only to the final conclusion, or does it go as well to  subsidiary factual conclusions, just to make sure we're clear on that?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> I think it would do both.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> That's what I thought. Okay.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> I think it would go to subsidiary as well. I  -- I think the -- the statute says on any material issue. And one can imagin e there are subsidiary material issues and ultimate ones. And I think that's the most consistent with cases like Anderson against Bessemer City, where this Court said clear -error review, for example, applies to both subsidiary and ultimate facts.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> How big a deal is this?  I mean, I can imagine there are not that many situations in which the evidence is truly an approximate balance. So even if the government's position is  -- you know, if we agreed with the Petitioner here, is this going to be a big deal?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> I think it is going to be a big deal. I think the vast majority of cases  that get appealed to the Veterans Court are raising essentially factual challenges to findings that there's no present disability or  no in-service connection or no causation between the two.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right. But the question  --</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> And -- but --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah. Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Oh, sorry. So just to -- just to continue on that  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah. Yeah.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> So, because of that, I think, as these cases illustrate, the Veterans Court is going to be reviewing the factual findings and, thus, has to take due account of the Secretary's application. But, if it's a de novo review, that means that in every case, this appellate court, which is not well situated to do it  -- the appellate court is going to have to, in every case  --almost every case, review the entire record, assign weight, balance things, figure out if it's an approximate balance. Appellate courts are not well suited to doing this, as Anderson against Bessemer City made clear. That's why there's a really strong norm in our system that --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I know. But then why  -- why did Congress clearly require the court to do it?  I  -- this is the thing that's a little unfortunate in a way in the way that I think you're arguing it because, even if we say Congress went back and underscored this obligation, the approximate balance obligation runs to the Secretary, right, and the underscoring is now to the court. So it's obvious that Congress wanted the court to have some assessment of whether or not the Secretary is doing it correctly. So I think you -- you don't get out of that by just saying, oh, the court is not well positioned. Congress thought the court was going to do something, right?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Yes. But Congress expressly had before it a proposal to change the  standard of review and then rejected it and said we're sticking with the clear error review. So  I think Congress was pretty --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah, but Congress also had before it a proposal to put that into -- this new ""take due account"" into (a), which would have made clear that clear-error review was supposed to be happening in this context, and it rejected it.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> So I  -- I disagree with that. I mean, look, it said ""in making the determinations under (a),"" which put it in there. And just to spin that out a little bit more, Justice Jackson, if they had put it in (a)(4), I think it would have been an awkward fit there because, as we say, the benefit-of-the -doubt rule does have some legal aspects to it. You know, for example, if you don't review all the evidence in the record, that's legal error. If the Secretary says it's not an approximate balance unless it's in absolute perfect equipoise, I think that would be a legal error. So they -- so Congress couldn't stick it  just in (a)(4) because there are legal aspects to it. But nor could it put it as an (a)(5) because it's not something that happens after you go through (a)(1), (2), (3), (4), you know, compel agency action, unlawfully withheld, et  cetera. It's not like a separate thing you do. You do it in the course of reviewing statutory legal challenges, agency action withheld, factual findings. And so the natural place to put it is somewhere else. You see this in 706 of the APA. It's the  --the prejudicial error rule is not stuck in 7062.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And so you don't think --</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> It's put outside.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that the deference that you say Congress wanted to retain was in the assessment of what evidence is positive and negative?  In other words, the -- the approximate balance rule says when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter. And I could see a world in which the Secretary's assessment of whether this evidence is material to this issue, is it, you know, credible and, therefore, I'm going to count it as positive?  Is it credible on the negative side?  All of those individual  determinations the court cannot review for anything other than clear error. But I thought you said earlier in this conversation  --and maybe I misheard you -- that you did think that approximate balance itself, once we know what the positive -- bucket of positive evidence and bucket of negative evidence is, is a question of law. I thought I heard you say it was a question of law.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Oh, approximate balance is a legal standard.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> And what it means is, of course, a legal question as to what it means, but when  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And whether or not it's satis fied?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Whether it's satisfied is a classic mixed question, right?  It's a standard of proof that you apply to facts in a case. And the application of a statutory  standard of proof to the facts and record evidence is a classic mixed question. And how  you review a mixed question, this Court has said time and again, depends on the nature of the mixed question. Does it involve primarily factual work or primarily legal work?  And our submission here today is that applying an approximate balance  --and the word ""balance"" itself implies weights and weighing things against each other as facts  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah, but you've already gotten -- you've already taken care of the factual assessments. I have my bucket. I understand it involves facts because we're balancing facts, but we already have the bucket of positive and bucket of negative that the Secretary has determined and we're stuck with that. The question of whether or not they are roughly equal, I don't understand -- I don't know why that isn't a factual question.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Well, I mean, look, I think because there aren't -- we don't put -- 73 actual weights with numbers on pieces of evidence and add it up. If we did, it would be a trivial exercise, right?  It's always qualitative. And so, at the end of the day, the Board is just going to look at expert opinions like here, for example, in Mr. Bufkin's case, right?  The  --the Board look at the medical opinions in the record and Mr. Bufkin had presented a medical opinion saying he suffered from PTSD, and then there were other medical evaluations that said he did not suffer. And the Board looked at them and said:  Well, the regulations require any diagnosis of PTSD to conform with DSM V. The one doctor who said he suffers from PTSD didn't apply DSM V at all. And, indeed, the next doctor who did apply DSM V and said he doesn't suffer from PTSD, said that</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right. So  -- so -- so those would not be credible. They wouldn't be in the bucket. And when the court did its assessment of whether there's approximate balance, it would say there's not, right?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Right. I -- I think --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> All I'm saying is approximate balance sounds to me like sufficient  -- sufficiency of the evidence, and sufficiency, approximate, seems like a legal question, not a factual one. So you keep saying this is factual, intensely factual -- the only factual part is deciding what facts go in to be weighed, but whether or not they're in balance seems to me to be a question of law.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> I disagree. I think what constitutes  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> -- an approximate balance, how far away the scales should be --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> -- that's a legal question. But I think where are the scales in this particular case I think is predominantly factual.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> And -- and, as I mentioned to Justice Kagan, I think that is the fundamental disagreement between the parties in -- in this case.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, -- 75 counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I have a question. The Chief started with whether this was a redundant, duplicate, unimportant provision or not. It's pretty absolute. The language of the BOPDR review provision say s the court ""shall"" review that issue. Yet you say, no, they don't really have to unless the party presents it. If I say no, you're wrong, that doesn't make this provision superfluous, does it?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> That's correct, although</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You don't want that outcome, but that's how to avoid the superfluous  -- how --making this provision superfluous, correct?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> That  -- that would avoid the redundancy, yes, right.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And wouldn't that also take care of everything you said was wrong with the old system, which was -- and I remember that veterans are generally no t represented. They're laypeople. And recognizing that they  may not be schooled enough to raise an issue on appeal, wouldn't this provision require the -- the Veterans Court to ensure that the court below has actually done everything it needed to do, that it looked at all of the relevant  facts and didn't commit the legal error of avoiding one, whether raised to it or not, and whether or not it committed clear error in its balance or not, et cetera?  It would do a lot of work to ensure the system was actually taking care of the problem Congress saw, wouldn't it?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> It would do work. I don't think -- if I could just --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> --now push back a little bit, I think it's  -- it wasn't the problem that Congress was facing, first of all. And I think it can't be supported by  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well, it was. The court -- the two cases you mentioned were the Secretary not looking at things and the Veterans Court not looking at what they did.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> No, I disagree, and I -- I apologize if that was the impression I gave you. I think the two cases that were mentioned were really the Veterans Court saying we find no clear error in the Board's finding of facts, without mentioning or even recognizing that the  standard of proof against which clear error was to be measured was lower than a preponderance. It was represented by the approximate  balance, so  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It wasn't looking at what went on below and figuring out if it was done right.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> No, we don't  -- we don't know. You could indulge the presumption of regularity and think the Veterans Court was cognizant of it, but to  --to say -- you know, you could -- for example, with a given set of facts, it could always be possible to say that if the standard of proof were a preponderance, the fact finder would not have clearly erred in finding that the party --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right. One last question.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> -- with the burden didn't meet but did clearly err --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Should we reach this issue?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> No, you shouldn't because both of the Petitioners here didn't raise it.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But your colleague on the other side, in her presentation, pointed out to one issue that Mr. Thornton allegedly did not raise. What do I do about that?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> I mean, I  --I -- again, I think the right standard, if you do want to reach it, would just be to say that the ""when presented"" language, which is a condition precedent on making determinations under (a), and making determinations under (a) is a condition precedent  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I think that might be better for us --</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> --but it's just --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- than saying that Congress acts  -- that it's okay for Congress to act in duplicate and make a provision wholly useless.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Not useless, just emphasizing something that already exists. And, as a practical matter, it did have an effect.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counse l.</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> So I think it worked.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Do you think Congress adopted this language about the benefit-of-the -doubt rule, in both instances where it did, in recognition of the high esteem in which our nation holds those who have served in the armed services?</text><speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text> Probably, yes.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?  Justice Jackson?  Okay. Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Ms. Bostwick?</text>"
