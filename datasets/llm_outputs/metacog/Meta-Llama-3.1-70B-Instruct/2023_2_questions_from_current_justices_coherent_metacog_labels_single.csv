The proposed consent decree in this case, however, would dispose of the United States' claims without its consent. The decree would impose obligations on the United States without its consent.

The Compact does so by incorporating and protecting the delivery of water by the Rio Grande Project to Mexico and to two irrigation districts, one in New Mexico and the other in Texas. The United States intervened in this case to enforce the Compact's protection of the project. As New Mexico acknowledges, the Compact imposes on New Mexico a duty not to interfere with the Project's delivery of water. The United States claims that New Mexico is violating that duty by allowing too much groundwater pumping. Six years ago, this Court upheld the United States' right to pursue those Compact claims, recognizing that the United States has distinctively federal interests in protecting the supply and the allocation of Project water.

Evangelis</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Like cities nationwide, Grants Pass relies on camping laws to protect its public spaces. These generally applicable laws prohibit specific conduct and are essential to public health and safety. The Ninth Circuit tied cities' hands by constitutionalizing the policy debate over how to address growing encampments.

17601,2023.23-175-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Okay. So suppose the relevant ordinance prohibited eating on public property rather than sleeping or camping. We're talking about eating. And the city, for very, you know, rational reasons, has determined that when people eat outdoors, it creates problems with trash and rodents and the like, and so it bans eating in public places and it punishes violators. Now, just as here, that seems generally fine because most people have restaurants that they can go to, most people have houses that they can eat in. But some  people don't have that option. They have to eat in public because they're unhoused and they can't afford to go to a restaurant. So is -- is your argument the same result, no Eighth Amendment problem, no problem with the city banning eating in public, even though that's a public function  --I mean, excuse me, even though that's a human necessity that everyone engages in, and, really, what's happening is you're only punishing certain people who can't afford to do it privately?","<speaker>Theane D.

What -- what is your understanding of the Martin rule?  Because I  --I thought it was premised on the circumstance in which someone had nowhere else to go and they needed to sleep and they needed to be there. But you seem to suggest that necessity is not sort of baked into what Martin was doing.","<speaker>Theane D. Evangelis</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Like cities nationwide, Grants Pass relies on camping laws to protect its public spaces. These generally applicable laws prohibit specific conduct and are essential to public health and safety. The Ninth Circuit tied cities' hands by constitutionalizing the policy debate over how to address growing encampments. Its holding that the Eighth Amendment bars Grants Pass from enforcing its camping laws is wrong for three reasons. First, the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause governs which punishments are permitted, not what conduct can be prohibited. Second, no precedent supports the Ninth Circuit's rule. Respondents and the  United States abandoned its reliance on Powell. Instead, they misread Robinson to bar any  punishment for involuntary conduct that's linked to a status. But Robinson held only that states cannot outlaw the status of drug addiction. It  made clear that they can prohibit conduct like drug use. This Court should not rewrite  Robinson six decades later. Third, the Ninth Circuit's approach has proven unworkable. The Eighth Amendment does not tell courts who is involuntarily homeless, what shelter is adequate, or what time, place, and manner regulations are allowed. But, in 35 suits and counting, federal courts are now deciding everything from the exact size of campsites in San Rafael to the adequacy of empty beds at specific shelters, like the Gospel Rescue Mission in Grants Pass, and cities are struggling to apply arbitrary, shifting standards in the field. This Court should reverse and end the Ninth Circuit's failed experiment, which has fueled the spread of encampments while harming those it purports to protect. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2023,coherent,"{

Wall</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In The Bremen and Carnival, this Court held that forum-selection clauses in maritime contracts are enforceable as a matter of federal law, except in the rare circumstances when they violate federal maritime policy. Almost all federal courts, including all of the major maritime courts, have taken the same approach for choice-of-law clauses. This Court should do the same for three reasons. First, logic and consistency. We're here talking about a federal exception to a federal presumption of enforceability. It stands to reason that federal exception would look to federal public policy, not state public policy. Raiders doesn't point to any analogous federal exception. It looks to state public policy. And it doesn't explain why choice of law in maritime should be any different from forum selection in maritime. Second, the consensus approach makes practical sense for the reasons that this Court gave in The Bremen. Judging choice-of-law clauses by reference to a uniform body of federal law accords with ancient concepts of freedom of contract, and it allows parties to gauge and price their risks knowing what law will apply to their contracts. If 50 states may set aside parties' choices based on their own public policies, that would be a reference for uncertainty and forum shopping. Third, the consensus approach is clear and administrable. On our approach, a federal court would ask, does a choice-of-law clause offend federal admiralty policy? The answer to that question will almost always be no. On Raiders' approach, the Court would ask, what's the state with the greatest interest in the dispute? Does that state have a public policy with respect to the specific question at issue?

The issue is whether there's a presumption of enforceability of a conflict-of-law choice, not about whether there's a presumption of enforceability of a particular term or substantive terms in a contract, but the simple question is: Is there a presumption of enforceability in a choice-of-law provision? And you seem to say, because we, the Supreme Court, hasn't said it, there can't be. But, obviously, Bremen put that to rest because Bremen found one, whether there had been one before or not, it announced that it preexisted itself. I'm still not sure you made that presumption below. The Third Circuit seemed to have made it. Every lower court who's faced the question has presumed that there's that presumption. You haven't given me a reason why in admiralty law there wouldn't be that presumption. We want uniform -- uniformity in maritime interpretation. We want people to be secure in knowing which laws are going to apply, not what the substance of those laws are, but which law is going to apply.

18567,2023.22-500-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"No, no, no, I'm just talking about as a matter of theory. Like, as a -- so setting aside what -- what Wilburn Boat -- I'm just trying to understand one reason why it would be that the federal exception -- you'd have to have federal interests in the exception is a couple, one is that we have a general rule and we have an exception and unless you actually have sort of the same dynamic working, you could easily see how the exception could swallow the rule. You'd never have the rule, right, because the exception is sort of being established on a different plane. So that's one thing. Another thing is, to the extent we're talking about federal interests overarching this entire dynamic, we know, as Justice Sotomayor says, the federal interests are in uniformity and predictability and all of those sorts of things. So, if we have a single federal spokesperson regarding what is accepted, you're more likely to advance the interests of uniformity and predictability, whereas if you have state interests operating in the exception, you're going to have all of these different exceptions popping up at different times and people aren't going to know what they're doing. So I appreciate that there's a world in which insurance contracts are different and they're ordinarily run by the states and each state has a particular interest, consumer protection, not, or whatever, but if our entire kind of framing is about ensuring predictability and uniformity, why would we have a world in which we would allow different state policy interests to be driving the exception in this way?","<speaker>Howard J.

Instead, it requires a reasonable probability that the new mitigation would have changed the sentence in light of the balance between the total mitigation and the aggravating evidence. The Ninth Circuit's approach is contrary to this longstanding test and must be rejected.

I -- I think what Justice Kagan is saying is that that standard takes into account for the purpose of its application that all of the mitigating evidence is being presented, that we present this mitigating evidence, we present this aggravating evidence, and would, if all of that had happened, be out -- is there a reasonable probability that the outcome would be different?  I think the problem that's happening here is that the district court, being a district court, is screening the mitigating  evidence upfront. There's sort of like another layer being added to this on the front end where  the district court, as you said in response to Justice Gorsuch, is deciding, well, is this really mitigating evidence?  Is this a fact?  Did this thing happen?  And it's sort of putting that initial screen on it so that when we get to the Strickland weighing, we have a smaller corpus of mitigating evidence because we've already weeded out the stuff that the district court  --I think that's not what's supposed to be happening actually. I think that whether or not this thing is actually a fact is determined ultimately, that at this level right now, the district court is just deciding whether or not that this basically has to go back to the states, whether the person gets habeas and it's got to be  done over again in some sense. And later is where we find out whether or not the thing is really true. But, in the context of Strickland prejudice, we're just saying this fact was never presented at all. And the question is to what  extent was the defendant prejudiced by that omission. So we're not screening upfront for whether or not that fact was true in any sense. We're sort of accepting it and -- and  -- and saying:  Well, in any event, the defendant might  not even be prejudiced because it was such a thing, right, that it doesn't outweigh the aggravators, so we're not going to send it back.

It's right now the fact that we're having this debate because OLC has said that presidents might be prosecuted. Presidents from the beginning of time have understood that that's a possibility. That might be what has kept this office from turning into the kind of crime center that I'm envisioning.

If a president can be charged, put on trial, and imprisoned for his most controversial decisions as soon as he leaves office, that looming threat will distort the president's decision-making precisely when bold and fearless action is most needed.

23437,2023.23-334 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," Counsel, the husband has no right of review, you're correct. And it's a judicially created exception of nonreviewability. So, if we make an exception,  it's us accepting something that's not statutory or constitutionally required. Her point is, whether it's her or her husband, they each should have a right to dispute whatever basis it was that formed your denial. And let's assume it was something as simple or -- as misidentification. You thought he was John Doe, and you had a whole criminal record on John Doe. And he's not John Doe; he's John Smith, John Smith Doe, which is another person. So the reason she's asking for an explanation and one that's required is that she says:  I have a right equal to the Mandel professor's. They had a First Amendment right to invite a professor to come speak to them. I have an equal constitutional right to live with my husband if I can. The second question is, is that a liberty interest?  And you say it's not. So let's take each of your points, okay?  As far back as 1888, this Court said in Maynard that getting married is something more than a mere contract, which is your position in your brief, that it's only statutory rights or benefits. In 1923, this Court described in one breath the right ""to marry, establish a home, and bring up children.""  And that right is one long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men. That's our Meyer case. In Loving versus Virginia, we said marriage is fundamental. In United States versus Windsor, we said marriage is more than a routine classification for purposes of certain statutory benefits. So  --and Obergefell, I'm not going to cite it, but it said something to that effect. So, if I assume that there's a liberty interest that has to be protected by some sort of process, then the question is, what kind of process is enough?  And in Mandel and in Nken, we talked about the statutory -- citing at least a statutory basis for exclusion. Here, you're saying she's entitled to nothing. Why do we have to go that far?  Why don't we just address, given all of our centuries of statements about marriage being something more?","<speaker>Curtis E. Gannon</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Last fiscal year, the Department of State issued 11 million immigrant and nonimmigrant visas.

Under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability, a noncitizen outside the United States cannot obtain judicial review of a consular officer's denial of a visa. Congress has not provided for that form of review in the INA, and when it added new visa-related provisions in 2002, it reaffirmed that it was not providing an end run around that. Nor is an end run available when a U.S. citizen family member -- here, the noncitizen spouse  -- wants the noncitizen to be admitted into the United States. As the Kerry against Din plurality concluded in 2015, that is not a liberty interest protected by the Due  Process Clause, and the U.S. citizen is affected only indirectly by the government's action against the noncitizen. Thus, Respondent Munoz cannot challenge the denial of her husband's visa application any more than she could challenge a decision at the end of a removal proceeding that he will be removed from the United States or at the end of a criminal trial that he would be sent to a prison far across the country. With respect to the second question presented, even assuming that Respondent  Munoz has a sufficient constitutional interest to trigger any judicial review, the Court should at the very least hold that the State Department satisfied the Mandel standard. The consular officer provided a facially legitimate and bona fide reason by citing a valid statutory ground of inadmissibility, the unlawful activity bar, just as Justice Kennedy's concurrence had found  had been the case in Din, where the government cited the neighboring terrorist activities bar.

Under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability, a noncitizen outside the United States cannot obtain judicial review of a consular officer's denial of a visa.

As the Kerry against Din plurality concluded in 2015, that is not a liberty interest protected by the Due  Process Clause, and the U.S. citizen is affected only indirectly by the government's action against the noncitizen. Thus, Respondent Munoz cannot challenge the denial of her husband's visa application any more than she could challenge a decision at the end of a removal proceeding that he will be removed from the United States or at the end of a criminal trial that he would be sent to a prison far across the country.

23468,2023.23-334 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," No, I understand that, but I'm just trying to see how your argument maps onto what the Court actually did in Mandel. And as I read that case, as I look at it, the first thing they're asking is whether these professors had some sort of right to receive information and ideas as protected under the First Amendment. They weren't saying at the level that you're saying now do they have a right to have this particular person -- or do they have a  liberty interest in having this individual come to the United States as their first question. It looks as though the way this opinion is structured, Justice Blackmun starts off by saying, in a variety of contexts, this Court has referred to a First Amendment right to  receive information and ideas, and he goes on and talks about that. And then he gets to the point that you're talking about when he says, ""Recognition that First Amendment rights are implicated, however, is not dispositive of our inquiry.""  And then he goes on to do the rest of the inquiry. So I think the parallel structure here would be the recognition that there is, as we've said in so many cases, a fundamental right to marriage, to include cohabitation, to raising your family. Those things exist. And that's implicated by the government's decision not to allow a person to come in -- the spouse to come into the United States. And then you go on to determine whether or not, even though you have this right that's implicated, the other aspects of the test. What's -- what's wrong with thinking about it that way?

25175,2023.22-846-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," I'm not sure I understand that, Mr. Snyder. I mean, suppose that we just take the definition and we plug it into n and o. What would your answer be then? ","<speaker>Benjamin W. Snyder</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The question in this case is whether Congress unambiguously waived the sovereign immunity of the United States when it amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1996 to provide that any person who violates FCRA's requirements is liable for money damages.  The answer to that question is no. To start, there's no basis for claiming that Congress has expressly waived sovereign immunity. For all of Respondent's emphasis on following the literal text of the statute, he ultimately has to concede that nothing in FCRA addresses sovereign immunity directly.  Instead, Respondent is asking this Court to read an unwritten waiver into the statute on the theory that every time Congress creates a cause of action that applies to both sovereign and non-sovereign defendants, it must implicitly intend to eliminate sovereign immunity. But that argument is wrong for two reasons. First, it's fundamentally inconsistent with the nature of sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity is a defense that, by definition, has effect only when there is a cause of action that would otherwise impose liability. So, if every cause of action that covers a sovereign also waived that sovereign's immunity, the defense would never matter. That cannot be right.  This Court has therefore followed a narrower rule under which courts may infer a waiver of sovereign immunity from a cause of action only if Congress has referred to sovereign defendants in the cause of action itself using language that would be effectively negated if sovereign immunity remained available and that therefore shows Congress's intent to displace the presumptively available defense.  But there's nothing like that here.

The answer to that question is no. To start, there's no basis for claiming that Congress has expressly waived sovereign immunity. For all of Respondent's emphasis on following the literal text of the statute, he ultimately has to concede that nothing in FCRA addresses sovereign immunity directly.

Sovereign immunity is a defense that, by definition, has effect only when there is a cause of action that would otherwise impose liability. So, if every cause of action that covers a sovereign also waived that sovereign's immunity, the defense would never matter. That cannot be right.  This Court has therefore followed a narrower rule under which courts may infer a waiver of sovereign immunity from a cause of action only if Congress has referred to sovereign defendants in the cause of action itself using language that would be effectively negated if sovereign immunity remained available and that therefore shows Congress's intent to displace the presumptively available defense.

25205,2023.22-846-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," So I guess I perceive Employees as being structurally dissimilar in relevant ways in light of its amendment history, and so I'm hoping that you can comment on that.  I mean, it seems to me that what happened in Employees, to the extent that there was some uncertainty about what Congress did, it was because Congress amended the definitions section, right, to include governments, and that definitions section applied to a whole host of things in the statute, the duties, the liabilities, or whatnot, and so there was palpable uncertainty on the Court's part as to whether expanding -- what was it -- employers to include government actually affected a waiver of liability with respect to the liability section. It seems to me here, when we have the amendment to the liability section expanding, as you conceded previously, the liability section to include other entities by use of the term ""person"" that had been previously defined to include government, we're actually accomplishing a different result.  It seems to me there isn't the same kind of uncertainty in the relevant situation of whether or not they intended to expand liability, which is what we need for the purpose of a waiver.  Can you comment on that? ","<speaker>Benjamin W. Snyder</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The question in this case is whether Congress unambiguously waived the sovereign immunity of the United States when it amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1996 to provide that any person who violates FCRA's requirements is liable for money damages.  The answer to that question is no. To start, there's no basis for claiming that Congress has expressly waived sovereign immunity. For all of Respondent's emphasis on following the literal text of the statute, he ultimately has to concede that nothing in FCRA addresses sovereign immunity directly.  Instead, Respondent is asking this Court to read an unwritten waiver into the statute on the theory that every time Congress creates a cause of action that applies to both sovereign and non-sovereign defendants, it must implicitly intend to eliminate sovereign immunity. But that argument is wrong for two reasons. First, it's fundamentally inconsistent with the nature of sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity is a defense that, by definition, has effect only when there is a cause of action that would otherwise impose liability. So, if every cause of action that covers a sovereign also waived that sovereign's immunity, the defense would never matter. That cannot be right.  This Court has therefore followed a narrower rule under which courts may infer a waiver of sovereign immunity from a cause of action only if Congress has referred to sovereign defendants in the cause of action itself using language that would be effectively negated if sovereign immunity remained available and that therefore shows Congress's intent to displace the presumptively available defense.

Shanmugam</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  To ensure continuity in their operations, closely held corporations will often agree to redeem the stock of a shareholder upon his death and then obtain a life insurance policy on the shareholder in order to fund the redemption obligation. This case presents the question of how the federal estate tax treats such arrangements. Because the proceeds from a life insurance policy to fulfill a contractual redemption obligation do not increase the corporation's net worth, they do not increase the estate tax owed on the decedent's stock. The court of appeals' contrary conclusion was erroneous. The legal framework governing this case is relatively straightforward. The Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations  provide that where the parties agree on the price to redeem a shareholder's stock, that  price will establish the value of the stock for purposes of the estate tax in certain circumstances. But where, as here, those circumstances have not been met, the value of  the stock is determined by the price at which such stock would change hands between a hypothetical willing buyer and willing seller. Here, a hypothetical buyer would not treat the life insurance proceeds as increasing the value of the stock because that asset is offset by the contractual obligation to redeem shares, a preexisting corporate liability. Now the government argues that a court should attach no weight to the redemption obligation when assessing the value of the company. But the government fails to distinguish between a contractual obligation to redeem stock on the one hand and a voluntary stock redemption on the other.

According to the estate,  before we can value Michael's shares in Crown, we must first subtract the price that Crown paid for Michael's shares. In other words, the estate's theory is that before you can value something, you must first subtract the price paid for the very thing you are trying to value. That makes no sense. Using the item you're trying to value as a line item in its own valuation will never give you the correct answer, and it doesn't give the estate the right answer here either. The estate's contrary view rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of a redemption obligation. A redemption obligation is not a corporate debt that reduces the corporation's net worth or the value of the shares to be redeemed. A debt owed to creditors reduces corporate and shareholder value. A redemption obligation divides the corporate pie  among existing shareholders without changing the value of their interests. And here the corporate pie was worth 6.86  million, not 3.86 million. And that's true even if you look only at the statute of limitation estate's own incomes. Walked away from the redemption with approximately $3 million in cash, but Petitioner also admits that Thomas walked away from the redemption with $3.86 million in value. And the estate doesn't dispute the Black Letter valuation principle that the interest of each equity shareholder added together has to equal the company's total value. That defeats their position because that means that Crown's total net worth before the family divided the company was 6.86 million. The value of the two equities licenses put back together and that means the estate evaluation of Michael's 77 percent stake in Crown at $3 million came nowhere close to fair market value.

It should be overruled for three reasons. First, Chevron violates the Constitution. Article III empowers judges to say what the law is. It requires them to interpret federal statutes using their best and independent judgment. Chevron undermines that duty. It reallocates interpretive authority from courts to agencies, and it forces courts to adopt inferior agency constructions that are issued for political or policy reasons. In doing so, Chevron blocks judges from serving as faithful agents of Congress. It mandates judicial bias and encourages agency overreach. And by  removing key checks on executive power, it threatens individual liberty. Chevron also violates the APA. The most straightforward reading of Section 706 requires de novo review of legal questions. Congress put constitutional and statutory interpretation on equal footing, and it required independent legal judgment as to both. As Justice Scalia wrote, the APA's text contemplates that courts, not agencies, will authoritatively resolve ambiguities in statutes. And, third, this Court's only justification for Chevron is the implied delegation theory, but that theory is a fiction. There's no reason to think that Congress intends every ambiguity in every agency statute to give agencies an ongoing power to interpret and reinterpret federal law in ways that override its best meaning. In this case, the agency misinterpreted the MSA to force struggling fishermen to pay up to 20 percent of their annual profits to federal agents. The government says that even if all nine of you  agree with us that the agency's construction is worse than ours, you should nonetheless defer to that construction and uphold their program under  Chevron.

I see Chevron as doing the very important work of helping courts stay away from policymaking, and so I -- I'd like for you to sort of think of it through that lens and help me understand why, if we do away with Chevron's framework, we won't have a problem of courts actually making a policy decision. So Justice Kagan gave you a number of examples, and I think the reason why th ose examples are hard or why they're ambiguous or whatever is because, at bottom, they're not asking legal questions; they're asking policy questions. How is it that, you know, ""stationary source"" is to be defined?  That's  not really a legal question. I mean, there could be several reasonable ways of interpreting  that. And at the end of the day, I think the way I've been thinking about Chevron is Congress has given that policy choice to the agency.

It should be overruled for three reasons. First, Chevron violates the Constitution. Article III empowers judges to say what the law is. It requires them to interpret federal statutes using their best and independent judgment. Chevron undermines that duty. It reallocates interpretive authority from courts to agencies, and it forces courts to adopt inferior agency constructions that are issued for political or policy reasons. In doing so, Chevron blocks judges from serving as faithful agents of Congress. It mandates judicial bias and encourages agency overreach. And by  removing key checks on executive power, it threatens individual liberty. Chevron also violates the APA.

Congress put constitutional and statutory interpretation on equal footing, and it required independent legal judgment as to both.

It requires them to interpret federal statutes using their best and independent judgment. Chevron undermines that duty. It reallocates interpretive authority from courts to agencies, and it forces courts to adopt inferior agency constructions that are issued for political or policy reasons. In doing so, Chevron blocks judges from serving as faithful agents of Congress. It mandates judicial bias and encourages agency overreach. And by  removing key checks on executive power, it threatens individual liberty. Chevron also violates the APA. The most straightforward reading of Section 706 requires de novo review of legal questions. Congress put constitutional and statutory interpretation on equal footing, and it required independent legal judgment as to both. As Justice Scalia wrote, the APA's text contemplates that courts, not agencies, will authoritatively resolve ambiguities in statutes. And, third, this Court's only justification for Chevron is the implied delegation theory, but that theory is a fiction. There's no reason to think that Congress intends every ambiguity in every agency statute to give agencies an ongoing power to interpret and reinterpret federal law in ways that override its best meaning. In this case, the agency misinterpreted the MSA to force struggling fishermen to pay up to 20 percent of their annual profits to federal agents. The government says that even if all nine of you  agree with us that the agency's construction is worse than ours, you should nonetheless defer to that construction and uphold their program under  Chevron.

I think George Stigler talked about regulatory capture. And I -- I don't worry in a Chevron regime about those people. They can take care of themselves, okay?  There is political account, fine. The cases I saw routinely on the courts of appeals  -- and I think this is what niggles at so many of the lower court judges  -- are the immigrant, the veteran seeking his benefits, the Social Security Disability applicant, who have no power to influence agencies, who will never capture them, and whose interests are not the sorts of things on which people vote, generally speaking. And, there, Chevron is almost always and, in fact, I -- I didn't see a case cited, and perhaps I missed one, where Chevron wound up benefitting those kinds of peoples.

It did not mean you must retain jurisdiction. It did not mean never dismiss, no matter how clear it is that the case will never come back to court. I get that modern lawyers often think of stays and dismissals as two completely distinct animals, but when Congress passed Section 3 a hundred years ago, Congress would not have drawn that stark a distinction. The drafters would have understood that a dismissal was one way to stay a litigation. When Congress intended that a court retain jurisdiction, it used those words in Section 8. Even if that is not the best understanding, this Court should accept it as long as it's plausible. Courts generally have the discretion to dismiss cases without prejudice when no one is asking them to do anything here and now and when another forum is actively adjudicating the case. If Congress wants to revoke that inherent power, it's got to do it clearly, and as Mr. Geyser said, Congress did nothing clearly in this statute. Congress did not issue such a clear direction. Congress does not even mention requiring ongoing jurisdiction. It does not even prohibit dismissing.

26221,2023.22-1218-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Well, sure. If the defendant has won, but let's say we have a situation in which a plaintiff who originally brought this case in court because they thought it was the kind of thing that should be litigated in court, lost the motion for arbitrability, so it's now sent off to an arbitrator, and then, miracle of miracles, they win on the arbitration. My question is, isn't that a situation in which a plaintiff could at least come back to the district court if it had been stayed and asked for confirmation?","<speaker>E.
