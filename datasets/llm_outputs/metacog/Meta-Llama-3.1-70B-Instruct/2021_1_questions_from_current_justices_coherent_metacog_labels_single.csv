The Sixth Circuit here blessed precisely the sort of opportunity he warned of. It held that when a federal statute prohibits ordering a prisoner's transportation with a writ of habeas corpus, courts may instead order transportation under the All Writs Act. But courts have no such power. Every All Writs order must be agreeable to the usages and principles of law, meaning the traditional writs as altered by statute. Transportation orders must be agreeable to habeas law because habeas writs were the only traditional writs used for ordering the transportation of prisoners. So, when a federal habeas statute prohibits ordering transportation with a writ of habeas corpus in a particular situation, courts may not evade that prohibition by issuing a transportation order under the All Writs Act. But the order here was improper for a second reason regardless. Every All Writs Act order must be necessary or appropriate in aid of the issuing court's jurisdiction. The order here doesn't qualify because it evades the rules governing discovery in habeas cases and facilitates the development of evidence that no habeas court can even consider.

First, the order here is conclusive. Second, the question whether the All Writs Act empowers a federal court to interfere with the sovereign's management of its own prisons is both important and separate from the merits.

Ross</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Contrary to Petitioner's suggestion, the government's rule is faithful to the text and it does not depend on synchronicity between the final elements of different crimes. Rather, two crimes are committed on occasions different from one another when their essential conduct elements are satisfied by different acts. That reflects the statute's text. If the same act satisfies an element of two different crimes, then the commission of each offense is not a different occasion, that is, a different event, occurrence, or happening. The government's test also furthers the statute's purpose because it separates defendants who have been held criminally responsible for multiple discrete acts from those who have been held responsible for a single act that resulted in several statutory violations. Now I agree with my friend that in the vast majority of cases we can apply -- we can decide this question pretty easily. On our test, they can be resolved by a simple rule of thumb. If one offense is over before the next begins, then the two are committed on different occasions because their essential elements are necessarily accomplished through different acts. Two examples illustrate the point. First, if a defendant burglarizes ten houses on the same street, those are necessarily ten different occasions. He could not have unlawfully entered each home through one act, and he had the choice not to commit another crime between each one. Second, if a defendant robs ten people in one place with the same stick-up, as in Petty, that one act marks only one occasion.

He would require courts to seek to identify the juncture of circumstances that gave rise to the relevant criminal opportunity.

If the same act satisfies an element of two different crimes, then the commission of each offense is not a different occasion, that is, a different event, occurrence, or happening. The government's test also furthers the statute's purpose because it separates defendants who have been held criminally responsible for multiple discrete acts from those who have been held responsible for a single act that resulted in several statutory violations. Now I agree with my friend that in the vast majority of cases we can apply -- we can decide this question pretty easily. On our test, they can be resolved by a simple rule of thumb. If one offense is over before the next begins, then the two are committed on different occasions because their essential elements are necessarily accomplished through different acts. Two examples illustrate the point. First, if a defendant burglarizes ten houses on the same street, those are necessarily ten different occasions. He could not have unlawfully entered each home through one act, and he had the choice not to commit another crime between each one. Second, if a defendant robs ten people in one place with the same stick-up, as in Petty, that one act marks only one occasion. As I think has become clear this morning, Petitioner's freewheeling approach would be much more difficult to apply. He would require courts to seek to identify the juncture of circumstances that gave rise to the relevant criminal opportunity. But none of that language is in the text, and Petitioner's rule would require courts to examine granular facts that state court records often will not include.

If we conclude that someone who goes down the street and burglarizes different houses and different cars going down the street, that that's all one occasion, if that's our common-sense intuition to borrow your phrase, you would disagree with that, correct?","<speaker>Erica L. Ross</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Contrary to Petitioner's suggestion, the government's rule is faithful to the text and it does not depend on synchronicity between the final elements of different crimes. Rather, two crimes are committed on occasions different from one another when their essential conduct elements are satisfied by different acts. That reflects the statute's text. If the same act satisfies an element of two different crimes, then the commission of each offense is not a different occasion, that is, a different event, occurrence, or happening. The government's test also furthers the statute's purpose because it separates defendants who have been held criminally responsible for multiple discrete acts from those who have been held responsible for a single act that resulted in several statutory violations. Now I agree with my friend that in the vast majority of cases we can apply -- we can decide this question pretty easily. On our test, they can be resolved by a simple rule of thumb. If one offense is over before the next begins, then the two are committed on different occasions because their essential elements are necessarily accomplished through different acts. Two examples illustrate the point. First, if a defendant burglarizes ten houses on the same street, those are necessarily ten different occasions. He could not have unlawfully entered each home through one act, and he had the choice not to commit another crime between each one. Second, if a defendant robs ten people in one place with the same stick-up, as in Petty, that one act marks only one occasion.

You make the point correctly that usually you can get pre-enforcement review in federal court when it's enforced, a law is enforced by a state prosecutor or a state executive official. That's longstanding law. The issue here is different because it's private enforcement in state courts, and that raises a novel issue for us about how to apply Ex parte Young. The Ex parte Young principle is that those who enforce the law can be enjoined or can be sued in pre-enforcement suits in federal court. But, as Justice Thomas points out, in the two paragraphs at the top of page 163 of Ex parte Young, state courts seem to be carved out from that. So that's the tension. I think you identified it. The principle of Ex parte Young versus the language at the top of 163, for me, that's been a real sticking point in trying to sort this out. Now one -- one answer you didn't give is that subsequent law says that when state courts entertain private civil suits, they enforce state law.

12292,2021.21-463-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"Well, I -- I think all these arguments were the same arguments that Minnesota raised in Ex parte Young itself. I mean, you look at the history of that case, it was an extraordinary controversy in the United States and in Minnesota about the federal court review, and that itself didn't exist before Ex parte Young. In other words, that was an extension of preexisting doctrine to recognize a problem that the Chief Justice was identifying with deprivation of constitutional rights and chilling on the ability to get judicial review. So Ex parte Young sets out this principle that you can get pre-enforcement review in federal court against state enforcement of laws that are assertedly unconstitutional. And 999 times out of a thousand or maybe every time until this case, that's a state executive official. It's a pro forma exercise usually to identify the state executive official. And Justice Kagan points out there's a loophole that's been exploited here or used here, which is the private suits are enforced by state court clerks or judges. So the question becomes, should we extend the principle of Ex parte Young to, in essence, close that loophole? In other words, put aside the language in Ex parte Young for a second, and that is strong for you, I agree, but the principle of Ex parte Young and the whole sweep of Ex parte Young would suggest extending the principle here, arguably.","<speaker>Judd E.

It has some direct enforcement authority with regard to S.B. 8's fee-shifting provision concerning any legal challenge to any abortion restriction or regulation and may also have some constitutional authority under Texas law to enforce Texas law.

Other states made it a misdemeanor to carry a handgun without reasonable grounds to fear an attack. Other states and territories began -- banned carrying handguns in towns and cities altogether or restricted it to situations of immediate threat. And in the early 1900s, many states made good cause a requirement for a license to carry a concealed handgun while also prohibiting in some cases the open carrying of handguns. In total, from the founding era through the 20th Century, at least 20 states have at one time or another either prohibited all carrying of handguns in populous areas or limited it to those with good cause. New York's law fits well within that tradition of regulating public carry. It makes a carry license available to any person not disqualified who has a non-speculative reason to carry a handgun for self-defense. New York is not an outlier in the extent to which the state restricts the ability to carry firearms in public, and it's not an outlier in asking a licensed applicant to show good cause for a carry license.

Clement</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The text of the Second Amendment enshrines a right not just to keep arms but to bear them, and the relevant history and tradition, exhaustively surveyed by this Court in the Heller decision, confirm that the text protects an individual right to carry firearms outside the home for purposes of self-defense. Indeed, that history is so clear that New York no longer contests that carrying a handgun outside of the home for purposes of self-defense is constitutionally protected activity. But that concession dooms New York's law, which makes it a crime for a typical law-abiding New Yorker to exercise that constitutional right. This Court in Heller labeled the very few comparable laws that restricted all outlets for carrying firearms outside the home for self-defense outliers that were rightly condemned in decisions like Nunn against Georgia. New York likens its law to a restriction on weapons in sensitive places. But the difference between a sensitive place law and New York's regime is fundamental. It is the difference between regulating constitutionally protected activity and attempting to convert a fundamental constitutional right into a privilege that can only be enjoyed by those who can demonstrate to the satisfaction of a government official that they have an atypical need for the exercise of that right. That is not how constitutional rights work. Carrying a firearm outside the home is a fundamental constitutional right. It is not some extraordinary action that requires an extraordinary demonstration of need. Petitioners here seek nothing more than their fellow citizens in 43 other states already enjoy, and those states include some of the most populous cities in the country. Those states, like New York, limit the firearms in sensitive places but do not prohibit carrying for self-defense in any location typically open to the general public.

By its plain terms, Section 404 only requires a district court to take account of one new development, namely, the changes to crack cocaine sentencing made by Sections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act. Section 404 does not entitle a defendant to insist that the court consider other unrelated factual and legal developments since the original sentencing, including the more than 75 non-retroactive amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that the Commission has adopted since 2010. Reading Section 404 to create such an entitlement would result in a significant and unjustified windfall for a select subset of crack cocaine offenders who were sentenced before the effective date of the Fair Sentencing Act. Petitioner's principal argument, as you've heard this morning, in favor of such an entitlement rests on the term ""impose"" in Section 404, which Petitioner would read to incorporate a requirement to redo the Section 3553(a) analysis that a court does in imposing an initial sentence. That argument is inconsistent with the text of Section 404 as a whole, in particular, with the text of Section 404(c), as well as with the undisputedly limited scope and nature of sentence reduction proceedings.

He explained that experience from around the country shows that most workers actually will choose to be vaccinated rather than to leave their jobs in response to vaccination requirements. And he concluded that the risk of some temporary staffing shortages is outweighed by the urgent need to protect all Medicare and Medicaid patients during a deadly pandemic. Congress assigned those quintessential predictive and policy judgments to the Secretary, and the states have identified no basis to disturb his conclusions.

19904,2021.20-1114-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"-- correct? And I think you have a stronger argument to say, if Congress says you can't include the 340B costs, then you can't add it back in and adjust it later when they restricted you from using it once already. I have a more difficult time buying your argument that a word as broad as ""adjust"" for purposes of this paragraph would limit the agency altogether from deciding that there were regional differences that had to be compensated. So, for example, if there were higher wages in one part of the country as opposed to another, I don't see why the agency couldn't and wouldn't say for the Northeast, we think the ASOP should be 8 percent as opposed to 6 percent because wages are comparable to overhead costs and we should vary the ASOP on that basis. And so I -- I have problems with your argument that, in all situations, we should say the agency can't define regional differences or can't define hospital groups. I find it a stronger argument to say they can't do it on 340B because acquisition cost says you can't base it on that.","<speaker>Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress enacted the statute at issue, which I will refer to as paragraph (14), to curb the discretion HHS normally enjoys when it sets Medicare rates for outpatient hospital services. For the drugs covered by the statute, paragraph (14) directs that the agency may set rates based on acquisition cost and vary rates by hospital groups if it conducts a cost study that meets the requirements of the paragraph. If it does not do a cost study, rates must equal the average price for the drug determined by a cross-referenced statutory formula calculated and adjusted as necessary for purposes of the paragraph. Now, in the order at issue, HHS set rates for Section 340B hospitals different from the rates for all other hospitals and purported to base those rates on acquisition costs, but it did not conduct the cost study that the statute requires. Now, at the threshold, the government asserts that courts cannot review that agency action. But no statutory text precludes review, and it makes sense that Congress would want review because the point of paragraph (14) was to constrain agency discretion. On the merits, the government asserts that separate cost-based rates for 340B hospitals can be justified as an exercise of the agency's authority to adjust price-based rates that the statute requires in the absence of a cost study. But paragraph (14) does not authorize HHS to vary price-based rates by hospital group, and it authorizes varying cost-based rates only in the presence of a cost study. And beyond that, HHS didn't base the rates it set for 340B hospitals on average price at all. It estimated the acquisition cost using a different formula and then swapped that number in for the average price number. That's a substitution. It's not an adjustment. And it can't be justified under Chevron.

You -- you don't dispute that the -- that the 340B hospitals have a complaint?","<speaker>Christopher G. Michel</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioners ask this Court to hold that Congress compelled Medicare to knowingly and dramatically overpay 340B hospitals for covered drugs at the direct expense of Medicare beneficiaries and other hospitals. Neither the statutory text nor common sense supports that result. First, Congress precluded review of covered drug rates for the same reasons that it precluded review of other OPPS rates. Those rates are bound together by the statutory budget neutrality requirement, and invalidating them years after payments have gone out the door would badly destabilize the Medicare system. Congress instead reserved review for itself. Indeed, as my friend said this morning, the highly detailed nature of this provision illustrates that fact. In any event, the rates here are lawful under that provision. Subclause 2 authorizes the agency to adjust rates ""for purposes of paragraph (14)."" Those purposes must include aligning reimbursement rates with acquisition costs. After all, that is what subclause 1 expressly provides. And, importantly, the cross-references in subclause 2 are to proxies for acquisition cost. The two subclauses are thus different means to the same end. Petitioners have no plausible account of paragraph (14)'s purposes that exclude cost-based reimbursement. My friend said this morning that HHS could exclude price concessions or tailor the rate for different providers. But that's not materially different than what HHS did here. My friend suggests that 340B, Section 340B itself, ensures providers, 340B providers, a subsidy under Medicare. But that cannot be correct because everyone agrees that subclause 1 allows the agency to set the rate for 340B hospitals at acquisition cost.

And, for my money, I -- I can see why, because Section 6 says that motions to arbitrate are to be treated like any other motion in federal court and are subject to the rules of federal -- federal jurisdiction, federal courts. And, as I read the cases, I see the courts of appeals trying to apply usual principles of -- of waiver or forfeiture that this Court has announced for use in federal proceedings. So, while you might have a state law defense, don't you also have a federal law argument that -- and -- and couldn't we simply say that part of federal law, to the extent it includes waiver, doesn't generally require prejudice?

21084,2021.21-328-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Clement, the problem I have with your answer for Justice Breyer is that the essence of the agreement here is to not be in litigation. Now you can argue the Petitioner, by filing a claim in court, she herself has waived it. So the fact that I waive it just evens out. I understand that argument. But the question becomes, did you know that you had the right to arbitration? And, here, you knew. Nevertheless, you didn't move for arbitration in the answer as a defense. You made a motion to transfer the case. When that motion was denied, you indicated a willingness to continue in litigation and went into settlement talks, and, actually, there were materials produced. By its nature, there was a delay in the speedy adjudication of the case because you didn't move to begin with to go to arbitration, so that's delay, something that was bought -- negotiated for. And the cost is the cost that Justice Kavanaugh said, an unnecessary motion, an unnecessary type of settlement agreement. Arbitration settlement agreements rarely require the production of materials. They just require talking. So having said all of that to you, the reason you waited was because you wanted to see how the court -- by your own admission, you wanted to wait to see if the court was going to approve of class actions in arbitration. So you were taking a calculated risk by staying in litigation. Why isn't that a waiver under Section 6? Why isn't that a waiver under any normal definition? It prejudiced the other side. It hurt them at least financially. It hurt them in delay. And you intentionally sat on your rights waiting to see if you could derive a benefit.","<speaker>Paul D.

22016,2021.20-1775-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas,"Mr. Fletcher, I think Petitioner was doing a little bit more than simply disagreeing with the acquiescence. From my understanding, they were disagreeing with the government's refusal to allow them to participate or to intervene at the appellate level in very -- in litigation that they thought would affect them significantly. So how do you -- rather than simply focusing on the underlying issue, would you also respond to the fact that they think that intervention is a normal practice in these -- some of these cases at the end of administrations? I don't recall the government opposing such interventions, so would you simply address that a little bit?","<speaker>Brian H. Fletcher</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The 2019 Public Charge Rule did not regulate or confer any rights on the Petitioner states. Instead, Petitioners assert an indirect economic interest in the rule's downstream consequences. Relying on predictions that were made when the rule was drafted, they say that it would cause DHS to deny adjustment of status to people who would be more likely to use state-funded public benefits at some point in the future. But we now know that those predictions were wrong. During the year that the 2019 rule was in effect, we know that it affected only about five of the approximately 50,000 adjustment of status applications to which it was applied or about 1-100th of 1 percent. The states do not have a legally protectable interest in preserving that negligible indirect effect, and, even if it did, they could not justify intervention in appeals from preliminary injunctions that do not apply in Petitioners' jurisdictions and that now have no effect anywhere because the 2019 rule has been vacated in a separate final judgment. The court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in declining to allow Petitioners to prolong appeals that no longer have any practical consequence. And Petitioners' criticisms of the government's litigation conduct do not call for a different result. Congress made a policy choice to vest in the Department of Justice the decision whether to seek further review of decisions against the United States. This Court has emphasized that both the government and the courts benefit from that policy precisely because the solicitor general takes a selective approach and often decides against seeking further review, and as some of the questions this morning have suggested, it's not at all uncommon for the solicitor general to make that decision when the decision in question invalidated a regulation. Here, DHS had decided to issue a new Public Charge Rule. The ongoing litigation would have complicated that rulemaking and required intrusive discovery. The 2019 rule was not producing its intended effects, and the rule's unintended and unwanted effects were aggravated in the public health crisis. Now Petitioners disagree with the government's decision to dismiss its appeals when faced with those circumstances, but that disagreement does not allow them to revive this litigation that the government had decided was not in the best interests of the United States.

If we step back and refuse to let the trees obscure our view of the forest, we can take into account everything that happened in this situation, which seems to be quite unique.

I'm not aware of a precedent where an incoming administration has done anything quite like this. And this was an issue that we had agreed to hear before. So, if we step back and recognize that we're not tied to the minutiae of Rule 24, why shouldn't intervention be allowed? It doesn't mean you're going to lose. It doesn't mean that the old rule is sound or that it's going to be entered -- that it's -- it's going to be resuscitated. Why shouldn't intervention be allowed?
