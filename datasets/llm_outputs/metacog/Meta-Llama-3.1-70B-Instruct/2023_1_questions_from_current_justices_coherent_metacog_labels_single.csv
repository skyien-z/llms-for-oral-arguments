Adler</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The 922(g) offense is what triggers ACCA's penalties. The government, therefore, agrees that courts must apply ACCA's criteria in effect at the time of the 922(g) offense, not the prior conviction. For example, if Congress amended ACCA's criteria to delete burglary and someone then committed a 922(g) offense, all agree that a prior burglary conviction would not be an ACCA predicate, even if it was one at the time it occurred. The only question here then is whether ACCA's controlled substance criterion somehow warrants different treatment. And it does not. That criterion expressly incorporates the substances on the federal schedules. Under basic rules of statutory construction, that means the substances are effectively written into ACCA itself. So where a substance is removed from the schedules before the 922(g) offense, it is also removed from ACCA's coverage, no less than burglary in the hypothetical.

I think the right thing to do with that intuition is to recognize that it's not like you can just exempt them from the First Amendment. They are obviously creating something that's inherently expressive in taking all of this quantity of speech on their web sites and  curating it and making selectivity decisions and compiling it into a product that users are going to consume. So the First Amendment applies, but I think that those kinds of concerns about how the social media platforms and how they look somewhat different from the other kinds of expressive products this Court has reviewed in prior cases can come in to the question of whether the First Amendment is satisfied with respect to any particular regulation. Now here we think it's not satisfied because of the way that Texas has designed this law. I'd urge the Court to rule narrowly. It's not necessary here to try to figure out how the First Amendment applies to new technology in general or to every possible website or the Internet in particular. This law has a very clear defect. What Texas has done is tried to countermand the protected editorial speech decisions of the platform and the only justification it's offered to the courts below  is that it wanted to essentially amplify the voice of users on that platform by suppressing the platform's own protected speech.

12377,2023.22-1165-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," If pure omissions are misleading -- it seems as though you're saying the mere fact that it is an omission makes it misleading. Can you  --is there a limit to that?  MR. FREDERIC K:  Yes, there is, Justice Thomas. And what the Second Circuit did below was it went through, essentially, a decision tree whether there was a violation of Item 303. It asked first, is there a known trend?  Would it reasonably affect the bottom line?  If the  answer to that is no, then any omission that would not concern a known trend wouldn't be required for disclosure. And if there was an  uncertainty about that, then the managers are asked whether or not disclosing that event would  be reasonably likely to occur, which is a lower standard still. The Second Circuit provided those kind of prophylactic protections through the decision tree that it undertook to determine whether or not an omission in these particular contexts would be important, and it determined  -- and this isn't challenged on appeal  --that it was objectively unreasonable for the company not to put in their Item 303 disclosure the facts that would be necessary to determine the company's readiness to deal with the IMO 2020  rule change, which is going to decimate the 6 oil market. And so, for that reason, it seems very clear to us that when the managers are assessing what needs to be in the Item 303 disclosure, omitting something that would be so material, as was the case here, would be independently actionable. And I would point out that the underlying Second Circuit case that's really on appeal here is called Stratte- McClure. That was the precedent on which the per curiam panel below relied. Stratte- McClure said that omissions that were of such materiality would lead the financial statements to be misleading. We think what it meant by that was the MD&A part. And the comment is made, well, the MD&A is many pages. Well, the statement in a Supreme Court brief can be many, many pages.

We know there are abuses of the forfeiture system. We know it because it's been documented throughout the country repeatedly of the incentives that police are given to seize property to keep its value as opposed to issues of probable cause or issues of legitimacy of the seizure, okay? We also know that that incentive has often led to months, if not years, of retention of property that ultimately gets returned to the owner because there was either no probable cause or because of the innocent owner defense. So the question before us is, if we make a determination to take the dicta in Von Neumann and in the 8-8 whatever case, all right, to say that's the entire process you're ever due, do we leave open the possibility that there are states, jurisdictions that are abusing this process and not leaving us any arms to correct it?

If we say there's no overriding first question, is this process, the features of this process, are they enough, whether it's under Mathews or Barker, then what we're basically saying is go at it, states, take as much property as you want, keep it as long as you want, let's hold out no hope whatsoever that there's ever going to be any further process that's due?

The answer is Mathews. Mathews is the default due process standard for civil cases and for good reason. It assesses both the private and governmental interests to guard against unreasonable risks of error. And the Court has consistently applied it to determine whether more process is due, including in Good, another civil forfeiture case. Respondents prefer Barker because Barker's answer is always no additional process. But Respondents' primary argument is just that $8,850 and Von Neumann already decided the question, not that Barker makes sense and Mathews doesn't. Respondents are wrong. As the Second and Sixth Circuits have explained in adopting Mathews over Barker, $8,850 and Von Neumann concern the length of time for a final disposition rather than the need for an interim hearing. The litigants in $8,850 and Von Neumann also were not claiming innocence, so they were not seeking and the Court did not address retention hearings. Only Mathews can answer the sufficiency-of-process question. The courts of appeals and state supreme courts that have addressed the question presented have overwhelmingly chosen Mathews over Barker.

And, you know, I was surprised a little bit, I think, about your answer to Justice Thomas about Von Neumann and why, if at all, remission is different. I had thought that it was not because it was discretionary. I thought it was because the -- the case seems to make pretty clear that it is an administrative alternative to judicial forfeiture under the statute at issue in that case. And so, given that -- you know, the owner was complaining about it not happening quickly enough. He chose the option of remission rather than forfeiture, and he wanted the remission hearing to happen quickly. And the Court, I thought, in the language that has been quoted, was making a much more narrow point, which is just that this remission is not a part of the forfeiture hearing. It's not required by due process. And so, therefore, you don't have a claim that it has to be faster under the Constitution, that, really, forfeiture is where due process lies in terms of your constitutional rights. But, of course, that doesn't tell us what steps are necessary in a forfeiture proceeding.

Let me finally just ask you about, again, the timing and whether -- you know, I think there is something to this notion that Barker is about timing, but, again, the question remains, isn't the claimant in this case making a timing kind of argument? And I guess I see that, but can you help me with the following hypo, and then maybe I'll also get the reaction on the other side. So, if we have a scenario in which everyone agrees that the average time for a forfeiture proceeding is, say, six months after the seizure, and everybody agrees that that is reasonable for due process purposes, Plaintiff Number 1 doesn't receive her forfeiture hearing until 12 months after the seizure, so her claim is that the government was too slow in giving her the hearing. Meanwhile, Plaintiff Number 2 receives her hearing in six months, but she claims that at some point within those six months there should be an opportunity for the court to consider whether she should have been allowed to keep her car during that interim period. She's not complaining about the time. Six months is fine. She got her hearing within the six months. But what she's saying is, while you figure out during that six months who owns this car, I should keep custody of it during that period, and I think we should have that adjudicated separately from the forfeiture hearing.

That's why people want this retention hearing, because it takes too long, even under Barker, to have the final adjudication. I want it back more quickly. Totally right. But we, in fact, have not decided this precise question. We have a couple of sentences which were written broadly and, if taken literally, would -- would answer the case.

First of all, I doubt very much that criminal defendants from whom cars have been taken are going to seek a retention hearing because whatever they say will be used against them in the criminal case. I don't think New York's experience reflects the use of these retention hearing by criminals or by people from whom the goods have been taken that are tied to criminal activity. These cases are most important for one group of people, innocent owners, because they are people who claim they didn't know about the criminal activity. Many of these cases involve parents with young -- with teenage or close-to-teenage children involved in drug activity. The ones that don't may involve spouses or friends. And I assume, in many of these hearings, to the extent that a person is involved in drug dealing, that the government pretty quickly will find out or not find out if that person has a relationship to a home or other place where drugs are being stored, distributed, et cetera, and the government can do what your opposing counsel said, ex parte hearing saying this is a wife who claims she's an innocent owner, but we have evidence that there's drug dealing going on from the home, it's unlikely she's an innocent owner. If it's someone who's unrelated and no continuing relationship, et cetera. So you're talking about criminals get -- keeping these cars. But, given that the vast majority -- I -- I believe the statistic was very high -- certainly, over 60 percent of innocent owners win, it is not criminals keeping cars.

12501,2023.22-585-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","The assessment whether a civil forfeiture proceeding meets the requirements of due process, timeliness is a significant consideration in that, right?","<speaker>Shay Dvoretzky</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question presented is narrow: Should courts apply Mathews or Barker to assess the sufficiency of process in civil forfeiture proceedings? The answer is Mathews. Mathews is the default due process standard for civil cases and for good reason. It assesses both the private and governmental interests to guard against unreasonable risks of error. And the Court has consistently applied it to determine whether more process is due, including in Good, another civil forfeiture case. Respondents prefer Barker because Barker's answer is always no additional process. But Respondents' primary argument is just that $8,850 and Von Neumann already decided the question, not that Barker makes sense and Mathews doesn't. Respondents are wrong. As the Second and Sixth Circuits have explained in adopting Mathews over Barker, $8,850 and Von Neumann concern the length of time for a final disposition rather than the need for an interim hearing. The litigants in $8,850 and Von Neumann also were not claiming innocence, so they were not seeking and the Court did not address retention hearings. Only Mathews can answer the sufficiency-of-process question. The courts of appeals and state supreme courts that have addressed the question presented have overwhelmingly chosen Mathews over Barker.

Ellsworth</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Federal Arbitration Act requires courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms. Respondents and Coinbase agreed to arbitrate any disputes about Coinbase services and to delegate to an arbitrator any threshold disputes about whether specific claims were subject to arbitration. Despite this delegation clause, the parties have spent nearly three years disputing this threshold issue. That's because, instead of enforcing the delegation clause, the courts below came up with rationales to evade it and to instead answer the question of arbitrability for themselves. The Ninth Circuit did so by characterizing Respondents' challenge as one of contract formation, asserting that contract formation can never be delegated and sidestepping the delegation clause. The issue,  as the court of appeals saw it, was whether the parties formed a contract to arbitrate these claims. If that approach were correct, courts in every case could ignore delegation clauses by just characterizing an arbitrability dispute as a question of whether the parties formed a contract to arbitrate the claims at issue. Respondents do not defend that reasoning. They agree the contracts here were formed and that they were in effect. Their argument is that the scope of the otherwise applicable arbitration agreement was narrowed  by a later contract to exclude their asserted claims. That question is one of arbitrability, and the parties agreed an arbitrator would decide it. Respondents blur three distinct legal questions in a case like this one. The first is the merits of the claims the Respondents assert. The second is whether those  -- the merits of those claims should be arbitrated. And the  third, which is the only question that was before the courts below and is before this Court, is who decides whether the merits should  be arbitrated. This third question is antecedent to the other two. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2023,coherent,"{

So let me  -- let me posit this hypothetical. Suppose we have two contracts, the first of which has a delegation clause that answers the who decides question, and the answer in the first contract is the arbitrator decides. We have a second contract that answers the  delegation question, and the answer in that case is the court decides. In that situation, where you have these two different contracts with two different clear delegation principles, isn't the question at that point, which contract controls?

And I guess my question for you is the inverse of the one I asked your friend on the other side. The point in Schein was, if you  agree to say the arbitrator gets to direct things, if this were all in one contract, it's possible some things would be arbitrated, agreed to arbitrate and some things would be  -- you agree to send to court. And if it were in one contract, there's no doubt that the arbitrator would decide which  -- which direction to route things, right?  The only question is does the second contract make this different than it being in a single contract. And I struggle to see why that would be the case. And I furthermore struggle to see why you would care because your real argument is that the agreement is to litigate this in court. And the routing, who's going to do the routing?  Now we're at the Supreme Court of the United States, years have passed, we still don't know where this case is going to be. You could have had an answer from an arbitrator that you belong in court years ago. Why didn't you?  Again, I just struggle to see  both sides why we're here.","<speaker>David J.

They want the Court  --they don't care who decides arbitrability. All they care about is how arbitrability gets decided because that's what goes to liability at the end of  the day. And so the plan is we need the Supreme Court to overrule the Ninth Circuit's weird ""existence"" language. Why do they need that and that only? The reason is that ""existence"" language originated from the Goldman Sachs case that was cited in our Ninth Circuit opinion. The Goldman Sachs case was somewhat similar to this case in that there was a preexisting agreement to arbitrate but then a subsequent, more specific agreement to litigate. The Ninth Circuit was looking at that situation and thinking:  Shoot, we're bound to apply the old presumption in favor of arbitrability under federal law, but we know  that as a matter of contract law, there was no real, mutual intent to arbitrate this dispute under the most recent, most specific agreement. So they made up a new federal rule. Oh, this is a formation dispute, this is an existence dispute, so that they could avoid the presumption in -- in favor of arbitrability and do the right thing under state law. We've gone to great pains to argue that non-preempted state laws are what apply here because, at the end of the day, those are the only laws that are capable of accuratel y discerning the parties' true intentions, no matter what type of contractual mess gets thrown in front of judges.

Now, on the other side of the spectrum, you have this quite obviously  comparative evidence. The Fifth Circuit seemed to have a very narrow view of what that was, like you have to point to a particular person who wasn't arrested. But let's expand that a little bit more and say, well, that would be a little bit nutty. I mean, if you come in and you say nobody's ever been arrested for that, I can't point to a particular person, but, look, nobody's ever been arrested for that, that should count too, right?  So -- so -- so, you know, that's all, like, very comparative stuff, right?  So in the middle -- and I guess this is where I thought your brief was interesting -- is objective evidence that you might take to support an inference as to comparisons with other people but that is not on its face very comparative in nature. And I'll just read you some of what you said in your brief. The timing of and events leading up to a plaintiff's arrest, the history of the defendant's interactions with the plaintiffs, the fact that officers falsely documented the arrest. Maybe the most  comparative of these is the employment of an unusual, irregular, or unnecessarily onerous arrest procedure. So all of these, you can understand how somebody could argue from them to a comparative statement that another person who didn't make these kinds  -- who didn't engage in this kind of speech activity wouldn't have been treated the same way, but it is a little bit of an inferential jump.

But then you seem to accept numbers or different kinds of forms of evidence that don't in my view necessarily go directly to determining that a similarly situated person was treated differently. So how --I guess Justice Kagan put it that there are sort of several inferences to get you from certain kinds of evidence to a similarly situated person.

First, Respondents say Nieves's rule, designed for a representative case of in-the-field law enforcement, now insulates all government officials. Picture the thin -skinned bureaucrat scouring for a crime to pin on his critics. According to Respondents, Section 1983 has nothing to say about that. Second, Respondents parse Nieves like a statute to say that it limits plaintiffs to a particular type of comparative example. To be sure, Nieves did recognize that evidence of subjective motive alone would not get a plaintiff an inference that this motive caused the adverse action. But Nieves does not blind courts to all but one type of objective evidence of causation. Respondents' position extends Nieves beyond its moorings. If the mayor in this case  got in front of TV cameras and announced that he was going to have Ms. Gonzalez arrested because  she challenged his authority, the existence of probable cause would make this evidence legally irrelevant. Respondents' position would also toss out of court a critic arrested for jaywalking on a remote country road, even if his town had never arrested anyone for jaywalking before, simply because he couldn't find a non-critic who jaywalked on the same spot. Nieves balanced important First Amendment concerns to protect the on-the-street first responder making a ""now or never"" decision to arrest a suspect in his grasp. It did not so loosely dispense with the First Amendment interests as to give government armchair quarterbacks a free hand at the time of their choosing to punish their critics. I welcome this Court's questions.</text>",2023,coherent,"{

14329,2023.22-529-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," Mr. Stewart, it might be that you have text on your side, but before we get to that question, I guess I'm interested in many of the inquiries that Justice Alito was making, and I'll just come at it a slightly different way. Yes, significance tests are common in the law, but they're not really common in preemption inquiries. We don't really see a whole lot of  preemption inquiries where we have to do this question of, like, how much is too much. And, you know, one reason we don't is you  -- you need an answer that applies everywhere and for all time. I  --I mean, significant effects, you could have no significant effect now and then 10 years from now, you're in a different economic environment and you could have a significant effect. And does that mean it would be a kind of on/off switch like one day the law applies and the next day, 10 years later, it doesn't?  So add to Justice Alito's question about maybe different parties would present  different records, maybe different states would have the exact same law, but the economic circumstances in those two states would be very different, so it looks as though the federal law preempts one state law and doesn't preempt the other state law.

Stewart</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  I'd like to make three quick points before taking questions. The first is that the Court shouldn't assume that the word ""significantly"" either in the opinion of the Court in Barnett Bank or in the statute itself is devoid of signifi cance. If Congress wanted a statute that said state law is preempted when it forces the bank to deviate in any way from what it would otherwise do, it wouldn't have used the word ""significantly,"" it would have used another formulation. Second, in Franklin National Bank, the Court didn't suggest that all state law restrictions on national bank advertising were preempted. It emphasized that the word ""savings"" was the very word that Congress had  used in the statutes to describe the product at issue and that it was the very word that in  consumers' minds was most closely linked to the product. And as Mr. Taylor explained at trial, the bank in that case presented extensive evidence that it would be hindered in its ability to obtain savings accounts if it couldn't use that word. And, last, I'd say, the Court should look not only at Franklin, the case the Court cited in Barnett Bank as an example of a preemptive statute, but also at Anderson National Bank, and Anderson National Bank involved a state -abandoned deposit law. It authorized the state to take over the deposit, force the bank to turn over a deposit from -- to the state upon proof that the account had been inactive for a specified period of time. And it's hard to imagine a more direct interference with the bank's ability to do business than telling the bank you would prefer  to hold the money and earn income on it, but we require you to turn it over to  us.

14367,2023.22-529-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Okay. Is what  -- is the thing that's codified the words taken from Barnett Bank, ""significantly interferes,"" et  cetera, or is it the holding of Barnett Bank? Is it how Barnett Bank itself understood those words?","<speaker>Jonathan E. Taylor</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Section 25b preempts a state consumer financial law only if, as relevant here, it prevents or significantly interferes with the exercise of a national bank's powers. Bank of America argues and the Second Circuit held that this statute preempts any law that controls or otherwise hinders the exercise of a national bank's powers, regardless of whether the law has any significant effect on such powers. This test conflicts with the statute for four reasons. First, Section 25b's definition of ""state consumer financial law"" is incompatible with the control test because it would require that every such law be preempted, nullifying the statute and erecting the very field preemption regime that the statute forbids. Bank of America's only retort is to  concede that state fair lending laws aren't categorically preempted, a concession it doesn't explain and that disproves its own test. Second, the control test ignores Section 25b's express codification of Barnett  Bank's ""prevents or significantly interferes with"" standard and, in particular, the word  ""significantly,"" which Bank of America reads out of the statute. Third, a control test can't be squared with  Section 25b's provisions for OCC preemption determinations, which must assess the impact of a state law and be based on substantial evidence. These requirements would make no sense if a control test were the law. Finally and perhaps most fundamentally, adopting a control test would require reading virtually all of Section 25b to have no real-world effect. With no plausible textual argument, Bank of America turns to policy, claiming that its test is needed to avoid mayhem. But Congress disagreed, and Section 25b has a solution to this concern. The OCC can make the preemption determinations contemplated by the  statute. That it has thus far failed to respect the statute's commands grants no license to this Court to do the same. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2023,coherent,"{

Second, the Courtright declaration does nothing to guarantee Fikre notice or a hearing if he is relisted and, therefore, does not address his procedural due process claim at all.

The Court squarely held as much in Eisner versus Macomber just a few years following adoption of the amendment, and the Court's decisions have held that line for a century. That precedent makes easy work of this case. It is undisputed that the Petitioners realized nothing from their stock investment. They were taxed not because they had any income but because, in 2017, they happened to own shares in a corporation carrying retained earnings on its books. This is a tax on the ownership of property. It therefore must be apportioned. Dispensing with the need for realization sweeps away what the Framers regarded as the essential check on Congress's power to tax property.

That phrase had a well-established meaning drawn from numerous preratification income taxes that Congress enacted before this Court's decision in Pollock. Several of those taxes were like the MRT in that they taxed shareholders on undistributed corporate earnings, including the income taxes in 1864, 1865, 1867, and 1870. And this Court upheld Congress's power to impose those taxes in Hubbard. The Sixteenth Amendment's drafters, therefore, would have understood taxes on incomes to include taxes like the MRT. That's confirmed by the very first income tax Congress enacted under the Sixteenth Amendment. That 1913 law taxed certain shareholders on their pro rata shares of undistributed corporate earnings. And the trend of pass-through taxation has continued throughout the next century from taxes on partners to S Corporation shareholders, to foreign corporation shareholders under Subpart F. Against all that history, Petitioners stake their case on Macomber. But the Court has limited Macomber to taxes on particular stock dividends that are not at issue here. If the Court now extended Macomber's discussion to invalidate all taxes on undistributed business earnings, it would cause a sea change in the operation of the Tax Code and cost several trillions of dollars in lost tax revenue. Petitioners say that every other provision of the Tax Code could be saved under a theory of constructive realization, but they don't provide a comprehensive definition of that term or explain why it would rescue every provision except the MRT. My friend today said it's a blanket term that's defined by the circumstances where you can say that constructive realization occurred. But that's simply circular. And by conceding constructive realization, they've acknowledged Congress's power to draw reasonable lines about what counts as income and who can be taxed on it, which is exactly what Congress did in the MRT. Finally, the Court doesn't actually need to resolve any fundamental questions in this case about whether the Sixteenth Amendment requires realization. The MRT taxes income that was actually realized by the foreign corporations, and Congress permissibly attributed the tax on that realized income to U.S. shareholders just as it has done in any number of pass-through taxes throughout our nation's history.

16559,2023.23-14-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," -- Mr. Fisher, sometimes statements about knowledge are actually defense important. You suggested that in this case the defense put that evidence in sort of because they were living in the world that the court had already established. But one of the things the evidence professors talk about is that if you exclude this kind of evidence, you could have a situation in which you have a battered spouse who assaults their  --the person who is beating them, and they're not going to be able to put on expert evidence that negates mens rea in that situation. What do you say about that?  It seems to me this is not all net positive for defense.","<speaker>Jeffrey L. Fisher</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Ninth Circuit holds that Rule 704(b) prohibits only explicit opinions that the ""particular defendant had the state of mind required to convict.""  The government appears unwilling to endorse that full test. It seems to agree, contrary to Ninth Circuit precedent, that Rule 704(b) forbids an expert from testifying that people in the defendant's position always have the requisite mens rea. Such testimony never explicitly mentions the defendant, of course, but as the government seems to recognize, it is clearly in the rules of  --in the words of Rule 704(b) an opinion about whether the defendant had the requisite state of mind. In other words, it establishes a class of individuals, including the defendant, and it assigns a mens rea to that class. Agent Flood's testimony here was no different. He testified that in ""most  circumstances,"" people like the defendant know they have drugs in the car when they cross the border. The only difference between that testimony and absolute class-wide testimony is that he posited that people like the defendant usually, instead of always, have the requisite mens r ea. But any such distinction is immaterial. Imagine an expert took the stand and said:  I believe the defendant in this case probably or maybe 80 percent of the time -- or maybe there's an 80 percent likelihood had the requisite mens rea. Obviously, Rule 704(b) would prohibit that testimony. And the testimony here is exactly the same. It expresses an opinion, a probabilistic opinion instead of an absolute opinion, but an opinion about whether the defendant had the requisite -- requisite mens rea. So that leaves the government's final objection, that Rule 704(b) should not be construed to prohibit what the government calls inferentially relevant testimony. And we agree with that proposition. The rule that I'm  advocating today has been employed by the F ifth Circuit for over 20 years, and it makes clear that modus operandi evidence, for example, things like drug traffic organizations use couriers to transport drugs across the bord er, that they -- that drugs are extremely valuable, are perfectly legitimate. The rule in the Fifth Circuit is that testimony from which a jury might infer mens rea is perfectly permissible, but testimony that assigns a mens rea to the defendant or people in her class is not okay.

I'm not sure it's the Fifth Circuit rule, because the Fifth Circuit has criticized evidence with respect to what the drug traffic  --the drug cartel's knowledge are. So I think you're breaking from the Fifth Circuit, as the government breaks from the Ninth Circuit. Everybody's trying to find that happy medium. But the Rules of Evidence don't say, even i f you can get something in a different way, your mistake is  --you can do it this particular way all the time. You know, I'm thinking about we have a lot of hearsay that you can't get it in under hearsay, but you can get  it in for other reasons that don't go to the ultimate guilt of people. Rules are rules, and there's a reason for them. And I think what you're arguing is this rule says you can talk about modus operandi of drug traffickers generally, but you can't talk about a particular defendant or class of defendants and what their mental state is because that's what the rule tells you you can't do. So it might feel like an exercise without a point, but it  is an important point. Isn't that what you're trying to say?","<speaker>Jeffrey L.

And that  -- I guess what I'm suggesting is that there is a difference between a  --an expert talking about a group, an ""on average,"" and here are the statistics that relate to how people operate or think or whatever as a group, and that that's actually a different kind of testimony and ultimate, you know, goal and  --and helpful thing for jurors when they are trying to draw  the inference as to whether or not this individual, right, is a member of that group, meaning acted in the same way or thought in the same way. That's still left to the jury so long as the expert doesn't himself say -- go on to say, and this individual is in that group, right?","<speaker>Matthew Guarnieri</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  By its plain terms, Rule 704(b) comes into play only when the expert is offering an opinion about the defendant's own mental state. That's the key textual limitation that resolves this case. Agent Flood's testimony did not violate Rule 704(b) for the simple reason that he did not express any opinion at all about whether Petitioner herself knew about the drugs hidden in her car. Indeed, he did not mention Petitioner a single time in his entire testimony. The Court should reject Petitioner's invitation to replace the line drawn in the text  of Rule 704(b) with one of her own invention. According to Petitioner, Rule 704(b) prohibits a  novel and amorphous category of what she has called class-wide mens rea testimony. That proposal cannot be squared with the text, purpose, or history of the rule. And I think the history is particularly instructive here. I want to emphasize three points this morning. First, when Congress enacted Rule 704(b) in response to the acquittal of John Hinckley, Congress adopted a reform that applies equally to both sides. It is party-agnostic, as Justice Gorsuch observed this morning. It is not a rule targeted at government experts. And whatever the Court says in this case will also govern future expert testimony offered by the defense on issues like insanity or battered women's syndrome. Second, Congress kept Rule 704(a) in place. The general rule in federal court continues to be that opinion testimony is not  objectionable merely because it embraces an ultimate issue. Rule 704(b) operates as a limited exception to that general rule. And, third, the original text of Rule 704(b) confirms that an expert may still testify with respect to the mental state or condition of the defendant, as long as the expert stops short  of opining on the ultimate issue. Agent Flood respected that limitation here. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2023,coherent,"{

Shortly thereafter,  Vullo extracted legally binding consent orders from the NRA's three principal insurance providers, barring them from ever providing affinity insurance to the group ever again, no matter how lawfully they do so. These actions worked as multiple financial institutions refused to do business with the NRA, citing Vullo's threats. This was not about enforcing insurance law or mere government speech.
