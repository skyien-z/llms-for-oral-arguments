Blatt</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves a dog toy that copies Jack Daniel's trademark and trade dress and associates its whiskey with dog poop. After a four-day trial, the district court found both infringement and dilution. The Ninth Circuit erroneously reversed both holdings. As to infringement, the Ninth Circuit did not disturb the trial court's finding of likelihood of confusion. It instead reversed by applying an exception to the Lanham Act that the Second Circuit in Rogers versus Grimaldi invented for movie titles. Under Rogers, an expressive work is allowed to confuse as long as the use of a mark is artistically relevant and not explicitly misleading. But the Lanham Act has no exceptions for expressive works. It bars using marks for any goods when likely to cause confusion as to origin, sponsorship, or approval. Artistic relevance has nothing to do with confusion, and both implicit and explicit uses can confuse. Nor does constitutional avoidance justify Rogers. Rogers doesn't plausibly construe any text, and there are no First Amendment issues to avoid. Trademarks are ancient property rights that necessarily restrict speech to protect investment in goodwill and prevent consumer confusion, and parodies can be confusing. Now, as a practical matter, parodies won't confuse when differences in marks, markets, or message, typically ridicule, signal that the brand company didn't make the joke. But absent these features, pervasive copying and trading off a brand's goodwill tends to confuse. And survey results showing consumer confusion indicate that the parodist did too much copying and not enough distinguishing. As to dilution, the Ninth Circuit held that the exclusions for noncommercial use mean noncommercial speech. That holding renders neighboring exclusions superfluous, and it nullifies Congress's decision to limit the parody exclusion to uses other than as a designation of source.

Shah</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question presented is whether Congress abrogated sovereign immunity with respect to damages actions against Indian tribes in the Bankruptcy Code. The code provision specifying the governmental units whose immunity is abrogated, Section 101(27), names individually the United States, states, and foreign states, as well as the department's agencies and instrumentalities thereof, followed by a residual clause, ""or other foreign or domestic government."" That definition, like the Bankruptcy Code more broadly, does not refer to Indian tribes specifically, the most obvious and natural means of including them, as Congress has done in every other statute abrogating tribal sovereign immunity. Accordingly, the best construction is that tribes are not included. But this Court need not decide the best construction. All parties agree that the clear statement rule governs, and because of that, the question is whether Congress has unequivocally included tribes so as to abrogate their sovereign immunity. In other words, as this Court has framed the inquiry, is there any plausible way to read the provision as omitting tribes? Petitioners easily surmount that bar. The First Circuit majority's reliance on the generic phrase ""other domestic government"" to sweep in tribes and apparently only tribes rests on a syllogistic interpretation of the terms ""domestic"" and ""government"" in isolation. Even if ""other domestic government"" could reasonably be construed to refer to tribes, despite their sui generis nature, the provision as a whole doesn't come close to providing the perfect confidence that this Court requires for abrogation. Indeed, Congress has long treated tribes differently than the governmental entities enumerated in Section 101(27), including under the federal bankruptcy statute preceding the code. Congress gave no indication, let alone an unmistakably clear one, that it newly intended to treat the tribes the same in the current code.

Now Justice Sotomayor pointed out earlier that even a -- a structural challenge to the agency is a means of escaping from an ultimate order. It's -- it's a challenge that you can make to get out from under it. But I take Mr. Clement's point to be that, listen, the most we get is a do-over. So this isn't just about having to endure the expense and the inconvenience of proceedings before we can ultimately challenge them and get relief. It's that the relief that we get in the end isn't an ultimate out from liability, but it's simply saying, if you want to come after us again, you have to do it in a properly constituted agency. Is that an argument that you find persuasive on the meaningful review point?","<speaker>Malcolm L. Stewart</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It is a longstanding principle of administrative law that courts will not intervene in an ongoing agency proceeding until that proceeding culminates in a rule or order that imposes sanctions or determines legal rights or obligations. Consistent with that principle, the FTC Act review provisions governing adjudications authorize court of appeals review only of the final Commission orders that terminate the proceedings. The APA confirms that this review mechanism is exclusive and further confirms that antecedent steps taken during the adjudications are subject to review on the review of the final agency action. Those provisions, taken together, make clear that district courts have no authority to entertain constitutional challenges to the Commission's conduct of agency adjudications. Axon argues that review of final Commission orders will provide inadequate relief because it will not protect it from the burdens associated with the administrative proceedings themselves. But this Court has repeatedly rejected similar arguments both in the agency review context and in applying the collateral order doctrine. The Court, therefore, should hold that the district court lacked jurisdiction over this suit. In the alternative, the Court should hold that Axon lacks a valid cause of action because the commencement of a Commission adjudication is not immediately reviewable. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2022,coherent,"{

At all relevant times, Petitioner here was a private citizen. He took no oath of public office. He received no salary from the public fisc. He possessed no legal authority to bind the state or make decisions for it. What he did have, like many lobbyists and donors and interest groups and others, was influence, in his case, influence drawn from years of public service, from a close relationship to the Cuomo family, and from his senior campaign role. But none of that creates a fiduciary duty to the public. None of it entrusts official power to exercise on the public's behalf. And so none of it can be the predicate for a bribery conviction. By trying to stretch Section 1346 to prohibit the sale of influence, the government also contradicts this Court's decision in Skilling, which saved the statute from a due process challenge only by narrowing it to its core and excluding novel outlier theories. And by pressing this influence theory in particular, the government strolls recklessly into a constitutional mine field. Judge Winter was right to call the government's theory a catch-all political crime which has no use but misuse. This Court should reject that theory and reverse the decision below.

At common law, third parties generally could not sue to enforce government contract rights unless the contract clearly specified that the breaching party would be liable to injured third parties. Because the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act contains no such clear statement, it should not give rise to Section 1983 liability. But, even if a clear notice rule is not required, the two purported rights that Respondent invokes under FNHRA do not give rise to Section 1983 claims. First, FNHRA and its implementing regulations provide a comprehensive suite of remedies, including a more restrictive private remedy that forecloses Section 1983 relief under Rancho Palos Verdes. And on this dispositive point, the U.S. Solicitor General agrees with us. Second, the two rights Respondent invokes are not unambiguously phrased in terms of the persons benefited. Instead, the two rights invoked here today are but a small piece of an overarching set of requirements addressed to nursing facilities that receive federal money. And the command to protect and promote those rights are, as in Blessing, system-wide commands, not an unambiguous assurance of individual entitlement.</text>",2022,coherent,"{

And, when they amended the statute, they said -- they changed it to the language that exists here but said this is really not a material change. So, if that's kind of how we're looking at it, then I think maybe we're not even being directed by the statute to care so much about the accounts because what Congress was trying to do is give the Secretary information about who was engaged in these kinds of activities, and then the Secretary could go afterwards and ask them for more information. There's that provision about the 25 accounts or whatever, you don't even have to give the information.

It would radically expand federal law, violate federalism principles, and end-run limits on honest services fraud.

If we write the opinion this way and say the right-to-control theory is invalid because the right to control one's assets -- being deprived of economically valuable information deprives one of the right to control one's assets, and that's not a traditional property interest, or that it conflates the materiality and intent to defraud one of property elements, period, does that solve the government's problem about cases coming down the pike and are writing this too broadly?","<speaker>Eric J.

If this was a regular fiduciary duty case, you would not be here arguing this didn't involve Indians and it didn't involve rights. You would just say, okay, let's talk about whether or not we actually have a fiduciary duty under common law or whatever. But you seem to be getting this positive source of law thing from the Mitchell Act cases, and those cases, I think, don't apply.","<speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. When a reservation is established, that reservation isn't just the land. It's also a right to the timber on the land, a right to the minerals below the surface, and, under Winters, a right to water for the reservation. Each of those rights is a stick in the bundle that makes up the reservation, and when the Navajo Reservation was originally established and later expanded, the Navajo Nation got all of those sticks, and it still possesses them today. There's no dispute about that. The dispute here is about something different, whether the United States owes the Navajo Nation a judicially enforceable affirmative duty to assess the tribe's water needs, develop a plan to meet them, and then carry out that plan by building water supply infrastructure on the reservation. The answer to that question is no. Just as the 1868 treaty didn't impose on the United States a duty to build roads or bridges or to harvest timber or to mine coal, the 1868 treaty didn't impose on the United States a duty to construct pipelines, pumps, or wells to deliver water. Those affirmative duties aren't part of the treaty. And because the government has never expressly accepted those duties, the Navajo Nation's breach-of-trust claim can't proceed. This is not to say that the United States doesn't have a moral and political responsibility to address the Navajo Nation's water needs. As part of the general trust relationship, Congress and the executive have secured for the Navajo Nation hundreds of thousands of acre feet of water and over a billion of -- billions of dollars for infrastructure on the reservation. And in -- in exercising its own sovereignty, the Navajo Nation is free to develop its own infrastructure projects, including by drilling water to access the cheapest source of water on the reservation, groundwater.

30036,2022.21-1484-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"Yeah, but Jicarilla wasn't even about whether or not there's a cause of action for a breach of fiduciary duty. Jicarilla, everybody agreed, you know, this -- excuse me. In Jicarilla, unlike this case, there was no agreement about the extent of the fiduciary obligation, right? I understood that case to be a dispute over whether or not the United States had acted as a -- a fiduciary insofar as the tribe could point to that action and use the exception to attorney-client privilege, right? It was -- it was about documents. And the United States said, okay, you know, you want to try to get access to these documents under the fiduciary exception to attorney-client privilege, but we're really not acting as a fiduciary. And the Court agreed. All right? That has nothing to do with, I think, what is at issue in this case, where you agree that you have acted as a fiduciary, that you are a fiduciary in the sense that you hold the rights in trust. So we've already taken care of the Jicarilla issue as to whether or not you're a fiduciary.

Neither of those apply to the two disputed instruments here. They're not labeled ""money order,"" and they are sold to consumers with bank accounts who are transferring larger sums of money.

Third, even if you thought these products were within the FDA, the two instruments here fall within the third-party bank check exception.

One is the doctrine of reading statutes to avoid derogation of the common law, and the other is this Court's repeated emphasis on the need for bright-line rules and predictability in this space.

Kavanaugh,"Just to pick up quickly on Justice Kagan's earlier question on ""similar written instrument,"" that's kind of a statutory version -- version of ejusdem generis, I suppose, and we're always trying to figure out what the key features are. Why aren't the key features here a prepaid money transmission product, it doesn't show last known address of purchaser, and the windfall purpose is implicated? So you have arguments, but why aren't those the better features to focus on when we're figuring out what ""similar"" means here?","<speaker>Neal Kumar Katyal</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns a piece of statutory text from 1974 in Section 2503, which is found in the blue brief appendix at page 2a. That provision exempts from the common law a narrow set of instruments, a money order, traveler's check, or other similar written instrument other than a third-party bank check. The question today is whether two products, MoneyGram agent checks and MoneyGram teller's checks, fall within that exemption. For many years, the defendant states answered that question ""no."" However, after engaging some creative consultants, they changed their mind. They were right the first time for four separate reasons. First, when Congress adopted that language in 1974, the term ""money order"" referred to specific commercial products labeled ""money order"" and typically sold to unbanked consumers to pay small debts. Neither of those apply to the two disputed instruments here. They're not labeled ""money order,"" and they are sold to consumers with bank accounts who are transferring larger sums of money. Second, the FDA was a surgical fix to this Court's 1972 decision with a key purpose behind it, to prevent the price of small-dollar instruments from increasing due to address collection requirements that states might adopt in reaction to this Court's 1972 decision. That rationale does not apply here, and the two instruments are outside of the FDA altogether. Third, even if you thought these products were within the FDA, the two instruments here fall within the third-party bank check exception. Like all bank checks, they are signed by bank employees, not purchasers. And, fourth, while we believe that our reading is the best reading of the FDA's text, structure, and purpose, we don't deny one could read the statute differently, but importantly, if you found things in equipoise, two things would independently break any tie for us. One is the doctrine of reading statutes to avoid derogation of the common law, and the other is this Court's repeated emphasis on the need for bright-line rules and predictability in this space.

I've heard you said -- say that there would be an incentive to include address information for larger-dollar products, but if that's true, then, under the common law, we wouldn't have the inequitable escheatment problem.

Bronni</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents the problem the FDA was enacted to solve. In Pennsylvania versus New York, this Court concluded that unclaimed financial instruments escheat to a purchaser's state of residence or, if that's unknown, to an issuer's state of incorporation. Because issuers of certain financial instruments rarely kept purchaser addresses, that meant a windfall for an issuer's state of incorporation at the expense of its fellow states. Just two years later, Congress responded to that inequity by enacting the FDA. That statute says that where addresses aren't typically kept for a class of instruments, those instruments escheat to the state of purchase.

To justify that, it argues that the FDA doesn't cover instruments that function precisely like other money orders but are marketed differently.

That statute says that where addresses aren't typically kept for a class of instruments, those instruments escheat to the state of purchase. Now, 50 years later, Delaware claims that it's entitled to the exact same sort of windfall that led to the enactment of the FDA. To justify that, it argues that the FDA doesn't cover instruments that function precisely like other money orders but are marketed differently. But marketing strategies do not define commercial instruments and they don't justify $250 million windfalls. Recognizing the weakness of that argument, Delaware alternatively claims that MoneyGram official checks are excluded from the FDA as third-party bank checks. That argument fares no better because MoneyGram is not a third party as that term was used in 1974, and MoneyGram's official checks are absolutely not bank checks. Nor, for that matter, does Delaware explain why Congress would have chosen to exclude instruments that present precisely the windfall problem that the FDA targeted. So it's hardly surprising that all three payment systems experts in this case, including Delaware's own expert, agreed that under any ordinary understanding of the phrase ""third-party bank check,"" MoneyGram official checks are not third-party bank checks. So we would ask this Court to overrule the exceptions and adopt the Special Master's recommendation.</text>",2022,coherent,"{

Martin</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When the government takes property to satisfy a debt and takes more than what is owed, it has a constitutional duty to return or pay for the excess. Here, Geraldine Tyler owed $15,000, which included nearly $13,000 in penalties, interest, and related costs. To satisfy that debt, Hennepin County took Ms. Tyler's former home, which was worth much more than that, and later sold it for $40,000. The county kept all $40,000 for public uses. By taking absolute title to Ms. Tyler's property, including the value that exceeded the debt, the county has taken private property without just compensation. The county could have collected the debt without violating the Constitution by following the traditional common law rule still followed in most states and still followed in Minnesota in nearly every other debt collection circumstance. Under that rule, the county should have taken the property, sold it, paid the debts from the proceeds, and refunded the remainder to Ms. Tyler. Instead, the county took everything. The county apparently does not dispute that Ms. Tyler had a property interest in her former home or in its value. Instead, it asserts that the government may redefine private property by statute. The consequence of that would be an unlimited power to define away private property and to confiscate it to pay debts, no matter how valuable the property or how small the debt. But this Court's takings decisions and hundreds of years of common law, Minnesota's own treatment of debts in nearly every other debt collection circumstance confirm that the county has taken private property for which it must pay just compensation. If not remedied with just compensation, then the confiscation acts as a fine punishing Ms. Tyler for the public offense of failing to timely pay her property taxes.

And it is in the passive voice, but it's talking about money or debt that's obtained by fraud. How do you convert that into a statute that is focusing on the debtor?","<speaker>Sarah M. Harris</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Bankruptcy law gives honest but unfortunate debtors a fresh start by extinguishing all their debts. Exceptions are narrow, must be clearly expressed, and reflect debtors' intentional wrongs, not someone else's. 523(a)(2)(A) thus bars dishonest debtors from discharging liabilities incurred on account of their fraud. The code does not bar unwitting debtors like Petitioner from discharging debts for others' fraud. That conclusion follows from the text. Section 523 specifies when the individual debtor, as distinct from others, cannot discharge debts. (a)(2)(A)'s reference to actual fraud targets the debtor's misconduct by requiring fraudulent intent, just as other tort-based exceptions target the debtor's fault. Since Neal versus Clark, even debtors who themselves commit constructive fraud can discharge those debts because they lack fraudulent intent. Congress did not irrationally bar debtors who committed no fraud themselves from discharging debts for others' fraud. Respondent and the government argue that anyone's fraud counts so long as the debtor winds up with a fraud-related debt. But (a)(2)(A)'s use of the passive voice does not reflect indifference to who committed fraud with culpable intent. Nor does Strang, which arose under the repealed 1867 act, control today's code. And while state laws impose vicarious liability for partners' acts, bankruptcy discharge applies different federal law rules to individual debtors because the point of bankruptcy is to eliminate liability. Bankruptcy is the last place to read in vicarious liability. Yet, Respondent's sweeping theory could apply throughout the code to deny discharge based on others' wrongdoing. That financial death sentence would fall mostly on unsophisticated spouses who do not realize routine transactions in marriage, like selling homes, create business partnerships in the eyes of the law. Dishonest debtors cannot escape their creditors, but the Court does not consign unwitting debtors to the same fate. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2022,coherent,"{

Congress did not irrationally bar debtors who committed no fraud themselves from discharging debts for others' fraud. Respondent and the government argue that anyone's fraud counts so long as the debtor winds up with a fraud-related debt. But (a)(2)(A)'s use of the passive voice does not reflect indifference to who committed fraud with culpable intent. Nor does Strang, which arose under the repealed 1867 act, control today's code. And while state laws impose vicarious liability for partners' acts, bankruptcy discharge applies different federal law rules to individual debtors because the point of bankruptcy is to eliminate liability. Bankruptcy is the last place to read in vicarious liability. Yet, Respondent's sweeping theory could apply throughout the code to deny discharge based on others' wrongdoing. That financial death sentence would fall mostly on unsophisticated spouses who do not realize routine transactions in marriage, like selling homes, create business partnerships in the eyes of the law.

Because we know that there's supposed to be a collective bargaining table, and we know that somebody has to be sitting on the other end, and we know that it -- that this statute doesn't really make sense for DoD to be sitting on the other end because -- because Congress has told DoD you can't be the employer.

Indeed, a serious sign of the problem with the Authority's position is that even now, 40 years after the Reform Act was enacted, no one can quite give a consensus justification for the Authority -- for the power the Authority wields. The Authority's arguments have continued to evolve while the union and amici advance novel arguments of their own. If Congress had really given the Authority this power, if it had really wanted a federal independent agency with jurisdiction over federal labor relations to issue orders to state guards, it would not have made the grant of that power so hard to find. Ultimately, here, there's no reason to resist the statute's plain meaning.

I thought that the Adjutant Generals are only subject to the FLRA's authority when they're acting with that hat on, that is, the capacity to be the employer of this group of federal employees.

32738,2022.21-1454-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch,But he's not -- he's not a federal agency for other purposes?,"<speaker>Benjamin M. Flowers</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Sixth Circuit and the Federal Labor Relations Authority held that Adjutants General and state guards, when they employ technicians, are federal agencies to which the Authority may issue orders. That is wrong. The Reform Act defines agencies to include executive departments, government corporations, and independent establishments. Adjutants General and state guards are none of these things. They're neither among nor part of the 15 cabinet-level agencies that qualify as executive departments. They're not government corporations because they're not corporations. And they're not independent establishments because they're not part of the executive branch. The Authority concedes all of that, but it claims it can regulate Adjutants General and state guards anyway because they represent or act on behalf of the Defense Department, which is a Reform Act agency, when they employ technicians. But the Reform Act says that the Authority can issue orders to agencies. It gives it no power to issue orders to non-agencies simply because they serve as the representatives or agents or designees of an agency. Indeed, a serious sign of the problem with the Authority's position is that even now, 40 years after the Reform Act was enacted, no one can quite give a consensus justification for the Authority -- for the power the Authority wields. The Authority's arguments have continued to evolve while the union and amici advance novel arguments of their own. If Congress had really given the Authority this power, if it had really wanted a federal independent agency with jurisdiction over federal labor relations to issue orders to state guards, it would not have made the grant of that power so hard to find. Ultimately, here, there's no reason to resist the statute's plain meaning. Dual-status technicians are employees of the Defense Department, and they should enforce their labor rights through and against that department. I welcome your questions.</text>",2022,coherent,"{

But I think what was lying underneath Justice Thomas's question was a suggestion that algorithms are endemic to the Internet, that every time anybody looks at anything on the Internet, there is an algorithm involved, whether it's a Google search engine or whether it's this YouTube site or -- or -- or a Twitter account or countless other things, that everything involves ways of organizing and prioritizing material.

33974,2022.21-1333-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"So I guess -- I guess I'm thoroughly confused, but let me -- let me try to -- let me try to understand what your argument is. I think that the confusion that I'm feeling is arising from the possibility that we're talking about two different concepts and conflating them in a way. I thought that Section 230 and the questions that we were asking in this case today was about whether there was immunity and whether Google could claim the defense of immunity and that that's actually different than the question of whether whatever it does gives rise to liability. That is, is there liability for aiding and abetting? That's tomorrow's question. And to the extent that you keep coming back to this notion of creating content or whatnot, I feel like we're conflating the two in a way that I'd like to just see if I can clear up from my perspective. Your brief says that the immunity question, Section 230(c)(1)'s text is most naturally read to prohibit courts from holding a website liable for failing to block or remove third-party content. And I read the arguments in your brief and I read what you said about Stratton Oakmont and the sort of background, and so I thought your argument was that the -- that you can only claim immunity, Google, if the claim that's being made against you is about your failing to block or remove third-party content. To the extent we are making a claim about recommendations or doing anything else, any of the, you know, hypotheticals that people have brought up, that's outside of the scope of the statute because, really, the statute is narrowly tailored in a way to protect Internet platforms from claims about failing to block or remove, right? I mean, that's what I thought was happening. All right. So, if that's true, then all the hypotheticals and the questions about are you aiding and abetting if Google, you know, has a priority list or if there's recommendations, maybe, but that's not in the statute because we're just talking about immunity. We're just talking about whether or not you've made a claim for failing to block or remove in this case today related to Section 230. Am I doing too much of a separation here in terms of how I'm conceiving of it?","<speaker>Eric Schnapper</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 230(c)(1) distinguishes between claims that seek to hold an Internet company liable for content created by someone else and claims based on the company's own conduct.

33975,2022.21-1333-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"But I've got to tell you I don't see three elements in this. I mean, part of me -- part of this is all the confusion, I think, that has developed over time about the meaning of the statement in the statute, right? I don't see three elements. I see literally a sentence, and the sentence in my view reads as though they're trying to actually direct courts to not impose publisher liability, strict publisher liability, against the backdrop of Stat -- of Stratton Oakmont. So there's like some -- somehow we've gotten to a world in which we've teased out three elements and we're trying to fit it all into that, when I thought there was sort of a very simple, sort of straightforward way to read the statute that you articulate in your brief, which is this is really -- this statute, (c)(1), is really just Congress trying to not disincentivize these platforms for blocking and screening offensive conduct. And so what they said is let's look at (c)(1). Let's have (c)(2). Let's have a system in which a system -- a platform is not going to be punished, strict liability for just having offensive conduct on their website, and, if they try -- if they try to screen out, we're not -- we're going to say you won't be responsible for that either. That's (c)(2). But it really doesn't speak to whether you do a recommendation or whether you have an algorithm that does priorities or any of these other things. That's how I thought that -- that at least I was looking at the statute in light of its purposes and history and -- and -- and Stratton Oakmont and all of that, in which case I think you would win, unless your recommendations argument really is just the same thing as saying they are hosting ISIS videos on their website.","<speaker>Eric Schnapper</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 230(c)(1) distinguishes between claims that seek to hold an Internet company liable for content created by someone else and claims based on the company's own conduct.

33997,2022.21-1333-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch,"Mr. Stewart, I just again kind of want to make sure I understand your argument, and so I'm going to ask you a question similar to what I asked Mr. Schnapper, which is the Ninth Circuit held that any information a company provides using neutral tools is protected under 230. That's at 34a of the -- of the petition. And your argument is that this neutral tools test isn't in the statute. What is in the statute is a distinction on the one hand between interactive computer service and access software providers and on the other hand content providers. And when we look at that, the access software provider is protected for picking, choosing, analyzing, or even digesting content. So 230 protects an access software provider, an interactive computer service provider, who does any of those things, whether using a neutral tool or not. They -- they can order, they can pick, they can choose, they can analyze, they can digest however they wish and they're protected, even those -- even though those editorial functions we might well think of as some form of content in our First Amendment jurisprudence, but, here, they're shielded by 230. And then your argument, I think, goes that none of that means that they're protected for content generated beyond those functions. And it doesn't matter whether that content is generated by neutral rules or not. That content is actionable whether the -- and one could think of content generated by neutral rules, for example, by artificial intelligence. And another problem also is that it begs the question what a neutral rule is. Is an algorithm always neutral? Don't many of them seek to profit-maximize or promote their own products? Some might even prefer one point of view over another. And because the Ninth Circuit applied the wrong test, this neutral tools test, rather than the content test, we should remand the case for reconsideration under the appropriate standard.

Requiring states to scrap neutral plans in favor of plans drawn on account of race set Section 2 at war with itself and with the Constitution.

So what -- what is the problem?

I thought you were saying Gingles Step 1 needs to be retooled to require some showing of a comparison with a race-neutral -- or, excuse me, a race-blind algorithm. And so then my question was: Okay, well, you would bear the burden, I think, of showing that there's a problem with the way that we're doing it now, that -- the way that Gingles is working, and that a race-blind algorithm actually produces a better result insofar as it's better implementing what Congress intended or it is required by the Constitution.

It means a district that is the type of district that would be drawn by an unbiased mapmaker.

34177,2022.21-1086-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"Yes. I am so, so glad for Justice Barrett's clarification because I had the same thought about what you were arguing, and I'm glad that you clarified that your core point is that the Gingles test has to have a race-neutral baseline or that the -- the first step has to be race-neutral. And -- and what I guess I'm a little confused about in light of that argument is why, given our normal assessment of the Constitution, why is it that you think that there's a Fourteenth Amendment problem? And let me just clarify what I mean by that. I don't think we can assume that just because race is taken into account that that necessarily creates an equal protection problem, because I understood that we looked at the history and traditions of the Constitution at what the framers and the founders thought about and when I drilled down to that level of analysis, it became clear to me that the framers themselves adopted the equal protection clause, the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment, in a race conscious way. That they were, in fact, trying to ensure that people who had been discriminated against, the freedmen in -- during the reconstructive -- reconstruction period were actually brought equal to everyone else in the society. So I looked at the report that was submitted by the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the Fourteenth Amendment, and that report says that the entire point of the amendment was to secure rights of the freed former slaves. The legislator who introduced that amendment said that ""unless the Constitution should restrain them, those states will all, I fear, keep up this discrimination and crush to death the hated freedmen."" That's not -- that's not a race-neutral or race-blind idea in terms of the remedy. And -- and even more than that, I don't think that the historical record establishes that the founders believed that race neutrality or race blindness was required, right? They drafted the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which specifically stated that citizens would have the same civil rights as enjoyed by white citizens. That's the point of that Act, to make sure that the other citizens, the black citizens, would have the same as the white citizens. So they recognized that there was unequal treatment, that people, based on their race, were being treated unequally. And, importantly, when there was a concern that the Civil Rights Act wouldn't have a constitutional foundation, that's when the Fourteenth Amendment came into play. It was drafted to give a foundational -- a constitutional foundation for a piece of legislation that was designed to make people who had less opportunity and less rights equal to white citizens. So with that as the framing and the background, I'm trying to understand your position that Section 2, which by its plain text is doing that same thing, is saying you need to identify people in this community who have less opportunity and less ability to participate and ensure that that's remedied, right? It's a race-conscious effort, as you have indicated.

And if they're not, the claim fails, either because it's preempted or because it fails under state law. This division of authority makes sense. Garmon held that the Board's interests in ensuring a uniform legal interpretation of the statute is sufficient to override the state's interests in adjudicating state tort claims, but it doesn't have a similar interest in resolving the facts. So, if the complaint alleges clearly unprotected conduct and the only issue is whether those allegations are true, the state court gets first crack at resolving the facts. That's probably why in this very case the regional director didn't even file his complaint until after the Washington Supreme Court's decision, instead of at the outset, which, under the union's view, would have prevented four years of wasteful litigation. The Court should therefore reverse the decision below and allow the state courts to adjudicate Glacier's non-preempted state court complaint.

34264,2022.21-1449-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Francisco, I thought that reasonable precautions was fairly clear. The one items that the Board has said are not covered are those where an individual, a union member, is acting in a way that any citizen in the same position would have been held responsible for. So, if you libel somebody -- somebody, it's not just you but any other citizen with no legal obligation to you would be liable. Similarly, no person who -- who's on strike or not can impose intentionally emotional distress, all right? Those are things that categorically we say can't be arguably protected. But, when it comes to destruction of property, I always thought you needed a duty that you're breaching. If an employee goes on strike, their duty to you has ended. I can walk by your plant and the parking lot and see those trucks running. I have no obligation to tell you there's cement in there. I have no obligation to move the truck. I have no obligation to do anything. That's what the employees at that moment, they went on strike. What the government is saying, however, is intentional destruction of property means that I'm taking an affirmative act, not just merely the -- the property perishing on its own. So I don't know why you're answering Justice Kagan -- you want something further. You're saying you as an employee have to continue an employment duty with me until all of my profits are safe. That's what I see you arguing.","<speaker>Noel J. Francisco</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court and the Board have long recognized that the intentional destruction of an employer's property in the course of a labor dispute is not protected concerted activity. That's why steelworkers can't walk out in the middle of a molten iron pour. It's why federal security guards can't leave their posts in the middle of a terrorist threat. It's why a ferryboat crew can't drive their boat out into the middle of the river and abandon ship.

    ""reasoning"": ""The question challenges the key assumption made by the speaker, Noel J. Francisco, that intentional destruction of property is not protected concerted activity, by pointing out a distinction between an affirmative act of destruction and merely allowing property to perish due to a strike. The question also raises a counterexample to Francisco's argument, suggesting that an employee's duty to an employer ends when they go on strike, and therefore they should not be held responsible for the destruction of property that occurs during that time.""

34266,2022.21-1449-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett,"Mr. Francisco, can I ask you following up on Justice Sotomayor, if we just put aside the reasonable precautions versus intentional test, let's say that we decide to stick with the Board's formulation of reasonable precautions. Can you talk a little bit more about this jurisdictional hiatus principle? Because it seems to me that if conduct is arguably protected, that might be because of a dispute about the law, like we're not sure what the statute means, or it might mean because there's a dispute about the facts.","<speaker>Noel J.
