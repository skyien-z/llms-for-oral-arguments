804,2022.21-432-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"Counsel, I have a question because you have set this up as whether or not we have a statute of limitations here, because you're trying to take advantage of Irwin and equal -- equitable tolling. But I typically conceive of statutes -- statutes of limitations as having a funneling effect, so we have to sort of start at what is the background rule or principle. And in the ordinary course of affairs, the default rule is that a plaintiff can pursue their remedies at any time, their claims at any time, and a statute of limitations limits, for all the reasons that you point out, limits their ability to pursue their remedies because we're trying to get them to do it quickly, because we're trying to preserve evidence. Whatever the reason Congress gives, it's sort of a funnel. Whereas, when I read this statute, you start at (b), but 510 has an (a), which I think is actually setting the default rule in this circumstance, that the (a) is telling us that at the beginning we have a very limited set of circumstances in which veterans can claim, you know, these kind -- this kind of compensation, right? (a) says, unless specifically provided, the effective date, right, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but not earlier than. It sets the effective date as essentially the application date. And so, if you look at it that way, we're not -- we don't have a funnel in the structure of this statute. We actually have more like a pyramid because the background rule is the effective date is the date of application, and what (b) is doing is giving some veterans under some circumstances more rights than they otherwise had. So maybe you can speak to whether I'm wrong about thinking -- thinking that, and that, of course, sort of undermines your view that (b) relates to a right of retroactive compensation as the sort of background principle.","<speaker>James R. Barney</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When service-disabled veterans are discharged from the military, they have one year under 5110(b)(1) to file a claim for retroactive disability compensation. This deadline operates like a statute of limitations by encouraging service-disabled veterans to promptly apply for -- for retroactive benefits or else lose that right forever. The Irwin presumption in favor of -- of equitable tolling applies to this one-year deadline because it's a non-jurisdictional claims-processing rule set forth in a statute for which Congress has waived sovereign immunity. Now the Secretary attempts to rebut the Irwin presumption by characterizing Section 5110 as a general rule subject to multiple exceptions, but that does not rebut the presumption. First, none of the other subsections the Secretary points to relate to service-connected disability compensation, which is the sole focus of 5110(b)(1). For example, the Secretary relies heavily on subsection (b)(4), but that sets a deadline for disability pensions, a different type of benefit passed by a different Congress at a different time. Other subsections set forth deadlines for dependency benefits, death benefits, and death pensions, none of which have any nexus to 5110(b)(1). Not one of those other deadlines would be rendered superfluous by the application of equitable tolling to 5110(b)(1). So this is not a situation where the deadline in question already includes an exception, an express exception, that would be swallowed by the application of equitable tolling. Here, there are zero express exceptions to the one-year deadline of 5110(b)(1). Finally, even if we accept the Secretary's argument that Congress provided equitable exceptions elsewhere in 5110, that only strengthens the Irwin presumption for 5110(b)(1) because, unlike in those other subsections, Congress chose to remain silent for 5110(b)(1), which is exactly what we would expect Congress to do if they -- if it wanted the general rule of equitable tolling to apply.

Reading the word ""civil"" into that text would mean Congress created special guardrails in civil cases but threw sovereigns to the wolves in criminal cases. The executive applauds this result, arguing that it alone makes the common law of criminal immunity. But the executive does not make the law, and an immunity waivable by your prosecutor is no immunity at all. Plus, the government's commercial instrumentality rule contradicts every common law benchmark, history, international practice, reciprocity, and the choice already made by Congress to define foreign states to include instrumentalities. Finally, Section 1605's commercial activities exception cannot apply in criminal cases. Section 1330 grants jurisdiction for the exceptions in civil cases only. And a contrary reading produces two radically implausible and dangerous results.

It is outlandish to think that Section 3231 authorizes federal courts to convict Spain. The U.S. does not dispute that criminal trials against sovereigns were unthinkable in 1789, would violate international law today, are unprecedented anywhere, and would risk retaliation. But all the same is true for sovereign instrumentalities, which by definition are sovereign. Schooner Exchange, after all, is an instrumentality case, a ship. And the FSIA defines foreign states to include instrumentalities. U.S. instrumentalities like the Export-Import Bank are sovereign. The FSIA independently bars criminal jurisdiction. Section 1604 provides that foreign states shall be immune from the jurisdiction of federal and state courts. Reading the word ""civil"" into that text would mean Congress created special guardrails in civil cases but threw sovereigns to the wolves in criminal cases. The executive applauds this result, arguing that it alone makes the common law of criminal immunity. But the executive does not make the law, and an immunity waivable by your prosecutor is no immunity at all. Plus, the government's commercial instrumentality rule contradicts every common law benchmark, history, international practice, reciprocity, and the choice already made by Congress to define foreign states to include instrumentalities. Finally, Section 1605's commercial activities exception cannot apply in criminal cases. Section 1330 grants jurisdiction for the exceptions in civil cases only. And a contrary reading produces two radically implausible and dangerous results.

In the last discussion with Ms. Blatt, the point was made states really haven't tried this, maybe a municipality here or there.

And, normally, when a federal official is charged with some crime in state court, you have a right to removal. I think it's 1442 maybe. But there would be no corresponding right to removal by a foreign sovereign. And that's just -- that's a bit of an oddity, an incongruity in your argument.

And then, on Rice, you know, a very different situation. Number one, a Fifteenth Amendment case not involved here, right to vote, but even more important than that, really, the classification did not relate to a tribe; it related to some centuries' old affiliation with Native Hawaiians, which was much harder to understand as a current-day political entity.

So I think there's an aspect of your Article I argument that really boils down to a fundamental question that comes up in the law a lot, which is who decides. Who decides whether regulation in this area counts for Indian self-government, promotes Indian self-government, has a sufficient tether? I keep hearing you say in response to many of my colleagues' questions that you think that regulation related to family affairs does not have a sufficient connection to Indian self-government. But, in the actual legislative history of this -- of ICWA -- and I'm reading from the Federal Register -- Congress says that -- it indicates that ICWA reflects its ""concern about preserving the integrity of tribes as self-governing sovereign entities and ensuring that tribes could survive both culturally and politically."" That's 81 Fed. Reg. -- Federal Register 38,781. So it seems to me that Congress has made a decision that regulating in this area is important for preserving the integrity of tribes as self-governing sovereign entities, and, therefore, I don't think it's sufficient for you to say to us that you think that that's not true.

1484,2022.21-376-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","But I have, I mentioned to Mr. McGill, difficulty understanding how the placement priorities work. So maybe I'll try an example. Let's say there's a six-month-old baby that had been born to an Indian couple and the Indian couple for whatever reason is no longer -- no longer there. And there are also no extended family members in -- in the tribe. A non-Indian couple comes forward and says we would like to adopt the six-month-old baby, and they check all the boxes under, you know, best interests of the child. In other words, in normal circumstances, this would be a perfect placement for the child. But non-family members of the tribe say that, no, they think it would be better for the child to be raised with the tribe on the reservation. Does -- does that priority trump the other best interest finding?","<speaker>Matthew D. McGill</speaker><text>MR. McGILL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: According to the federal government, in 2020, there were over 11,000 Native American children in state foster care. The Indian Child Welfare Act deprives Native -- deprives Indian children of the best interests of the child test. It replaces that test with a hierarchy of placement preferences that puts Native -- non-Indian families at the bottom of the list. As this Court explained in Holyfield, this effectuates a federal policy of sending Indian children to the Indian community. The problem is -- is that there are fewer than 2,000 Native American foster homes. That means each year hundreds, if not thousands, of Indian children are placed in non-Indian foster homes, and sometimes there they bond with those families. Yet, when those families try to adopt those children, ICWA rears its head for a second time, allowing tribes to play the proverbial ICWA trump card at the eleventh hour. This is happening now for a second time to the Brackeens as they try to adopt YRJ, who is now four-and-a-half years old.

1521,2022.21-376-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"Yes. So I -- I agree to some extent with Justice Kavanaugh that there are strong interests on both sides of these issues. What I'm mostly concerned about is that we might be taking it upon ourselves to weigh those interests where, really, our role should be thinking about what the framers intended with respect to the scope of Congress's authority as it regards Indian affairs and what Congress believed was necessary to protect Indians given that exercise of authority. So I guess I'm -- that makes me wonder whether we shouldn't be giving more weight to the statements in the legislative history from Congress in terms of its decision that ICWA and its provisions were, in fact, related to tribal sovereignty, necessary to preserve tribal sovereignty. So let me just ask you, how -- how much weight, if any, should we be giving to clear, direct statements from Congress that this was being done pursuant to its understanding of its plenary authority as given it -- given to it in the Constitution and that it was necessary from Congress's perspective to solve for the problem of these state welfare practices that were causing harm to Indian children given its responsibility as a trust relationship for Indian affairs?","<speaker>Matthew D. McGill</speaker><text>MR. McGILL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: According to the federal government, in 2020, there were over 11,000 Native American children in state foster care. The Indian Child Welfare Act deprives Native -- deprives Indian children of the best interests of the child test. It replaces that test with a hierarchy of placement preferences that puts Native -- non-Indian families at the bottom of the list. As this Court explained in Holyfield, this effectuates a federal policy of sending Indian children to the Indian community. The problem is -- is that there are fewer than 2,000 Native American foster homes. That means each year hundreds, if not thousands, of Indian children are placed in non-Indian foster homes, and sometimes there they bond with those families. Yet, when those families try to adopt those children, ICWA rears its head for a second time, allowing tribes to play the proverbial ICWA trump card at the eleventh hour. This is happening now for a second time to the Brackeens as they try to adopt YRJ, who is now four-and-a-half years old. For a second time, the Brackeens are asked to show good cause to overcome the placement preferences under a new regulatory standard that, in the agency's words, is narrow, limited, and not a best interests test.

In Beard, Justice Kennedy said that when we -- when we approach the question of the consistency of state courts' decision-making in this area, adequate -- interpreting their own laws, their own procedural rules, 32.1, whatever it is, we have to give those state supreme courts some leeway to develop their own jurisprudence that we would expect to allow ourselves and other federal courts.

Indeed, the jury foreman the very next day said: ""We wanted a reason to be lenient, and many of us would have rather voted for life, but we were not given an option to vote for life in prison without the possibility of parole."" Cruz wasn't the only one. Twelve separate times, 12 separate times, the Arizona Supreme Court wrote decisions refusing to apply Simmons. In 2016, this Court summarily reversed all this in Lynch, fundamentally changing capital trials in Arizona. Cruz then used Lynch to seek post-conviction relief under Arizona Rule 32.1(g). Yet, the Arizona Supreme Court refused, saying Lynch didn't change the law; it just changed the application of the law. That interpretation of Rule 32 is not an adequate and independent state ground for three separate reasons. First, to be adequate, an interpretation must be firmly established and regularly followed. This hair-splitting distinction between changes in the law and applications of the law is entirely novel, entirely hand-crafted. The state doesn't even defend it. Second, the decision below discriminates against federal rights. It places defendants like Cruz in a catch-22. To prevail under federal law, they have to argue that Lynch applied a settled rule, but that very argument dooms their claims under state law. It also discriminates against decisions of this Court by giving them narrower effect. And, finally, the decision below is not independent; it's interwoven with federal questions.

This case concerns the reason -- the requirement that patents enable skilled artisans to make and use the invention. The roadmap in Amgen's patents allows skilled artisans to easily make those antibodies every time using two new anchor antibodies that cover the entire sweet spot so skilled artisans can be certain to make all the claims' antibodies, including defendants' examples. The Federal Circuit here never identified a single actual antibody that's in the claims that can't be made or requires undue experimentation. Instead, it invoked something that no one will defend is even relevant here: the cumulative effort to make all or some large group of an invention's potentially myriad variations.

In his brief in opposition to certiorari, Mr. Younger suggested an entirely superfluous rule, that parties could preserve purely legal issues by just adding one sentence to Rule 50 JMOL motions. But, if that were the rule, it would truly be a pointless formality with no benefit whatsoever. An ""add one sentence"" Rule 50 motion would never be granted because it is just a bare request for the judge to reconsider her earlier ruling at summary judgment. And the posture of any resulting appeal would be no different than if the appeal were taken directly from the error in the denial of the summary judgment motion. The rule would not prevent retrials, for example, following successful appeal because any subsidiary fact disputes would not have been the subject of the trial. The ""add one sentence"" rule would only be a pointless gotcha rule. Seemingly recognizing that the ""add one sentence"" rule has no point, Mr. Younger pivoted to an astonishingly wasteful rule in his merits brief in this Court. Under that rule, he says, to preserve a purely legal issue for appeal, parties should insist on trying the case as if the claim was not already foreclosed. Parties should call every witness, introduce every document into evidence, and fight over jury instructions, all as if the judge had never ruled on summary judgment at all. He claims this is -- that this approach would avoid retrials in the event of successful appeals. But it would never happen. No one thinks it is right, and I doubt Mr. Younger will defend it here today. And if you'll permit me to go slightly over time, I'll just close by saying that the Court should reject a rule that would prevent appellate courts from collect -- correcting clear legal errors, even when those errors can be intelligently reviewed on an undisputed record and when no party is prejudiced by that review.

You rely on one treaty to say the default rule is no unilateral termination, yet one of the professors you rely on, Zimmermann, wrote approvingly of a U.S. position in a Dyer case in 1951 that predated this compact, and, there, he wrote that outside of certain kinds of contracts -- and I think he meant setting boundaries -- the presumption should be that compacts call -- calling for indefinite continuing performance are subject to unilateral withdrawal. So he took their position contrary to yours. I look at the 86 contracts that you mentioned, many of them are boundaries, many are water rights. I'm -- I'm actually not sure that -- where we get the default provision that those are indefinite because what we're saying is states shouldn't be presumed to give up their sovereignty, and particularly with water rights cases, that's exactly what they're doing.

So I -- I appreciate the very clear exposition of what the purpose of silence is in relation to background principles, but I assume the response would be, and I want to give you a chance to address it, that in a way assumes clarity and certainty about what the background contract principle is in this context, and New York says, look at all these other compacts, look at the circumstances, the background principle is, you can't withdraw in this situation. So what -- what do you have on that point? What is the background principle in this context?","<speaker>Jeremy M. Feigenbaum</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question this case presents is whether the Waterfront Commission Compact prevents New Jersey from reclaiming its police powers. As New York admits, there is nothing in the plain text of the compact that expressly limits New Jersey's withdrawal. And as New York this morning has confirmed, there is nothing that justifies a perpetual veto in an agreement New York now admits is not itself perpetual. Instead, the compact's silence confirms that settled background rules apply, and those rules, contract law and state sovereignty, both well established by the 19th Century, allow New Jersey to withdraw. Indeed, under this Court's cases, including those cases involving government contracts, different categories of agreements are subject to different rules. On the one hand, there are agreements to convey property or to settle legal disputes over a particular res. Those agreements are presumptively permanent, meaning that states cannot withdraw from agreements settling boundaries or settling water rights. On the other hand, as New York has conceded this morning, contracts of continuing performance are different, that in the face of silence, parties can withdraw from agreements that would otherwise require them to keep performing forever. This compact is precisely the sort of arrangement from which parties can presumptively withdraw. In 1953, New York and New Jersey agreed to each delegate their own licensing and policing powers to the bistate agency. But 70 years have passed, and the New Jersey legislature has concluded that the Commission now engages in overregulation of business and is ill-equipped to handle 21st Century security challenges. New York believes that the New Jersey legislature can never reclaim its police powers. But New York's perpetual veto would deprive our legislature of the flexibility and the accountability to the people that are at the heart of sovereignty.

Vale</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When New York and New Jersey formed the Waterfront Commission Compact in 1953, they intended to prohibit unilateral termination. We know that from both the historical practice of compacting at the time and the circumstances of this compact. The history and tradition of compacts leading to 1953 shows the prevailing understanding that unilateral termination is not allowed unless the compact expressly grants that power. Out of 80 compacts before 1953, approximately 56 omitted a termination provision. New Jersey seems to admit that, despite that omission, most of these compacts did not allow unilateral termination. When New York and New Jersey omitted a termination clause here, they intended the same result, no unilateral termination. New Jersey points to commercial contracts and treatises about them, but states agreeing to jointly regulate labor and protect against organized crime do not have the same expectations as buyers and sellers of goods. Prior compacts and the authoritative treatise about compacts formed the states' expectations here. That treatise says that unilateral termination is not allowed unless the compact expressly says so. The text and circumstances of this compact further show the state -- that the states did not allow unilateral termination. For example, the compact requires joint agreement for nearly everything. The likely expectation was that joint agreement would be required to abolish the Commission. This intent makes sense because, by 1953, the states already jointly managed terminals in a shared port district through the Port Authority Compact, a compact that predated and is expressly linked to the Waterfront Compact, and that compact, the Port Authority Compact, is silent on termination after the Port Authority began operating. The states exercised their sovereignty in forming the compact here and then relied on that sovereign arrangement in developing their shared port.

Sand the question that we're all debating now is whether the prior cases were definitive holdings that the Quiet Title Act's time bar is jurisdictional, but can I just for a second ask you to hypothesize a world in which we didn't have a prior case about this issue, and so we were applying what we now understand to be the way in which you determine the question of what Congress intended about the jurisdictional nature of this? In that world, is the government's position -- and I wasn't quite clear from pages 12 and 13 of your brief -- is the government's position that this would be jurisdictional under the current test?","<speaker>Benjamin W. Snyder</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: On two prior occasions when the Quiet Title Act's 12-year time bar was squarely at issue, this Court held that the time bar imposed a jurisdictional limit on the Court's power to adjudicate the merits of property claims against the United States. Those decisions were clearly correct under then-governing law, and, indeed, this Court later cited them as controlling authority for the settled principle that conditions on a waiver of sovereign immunity should be treated as jurisdictional. Petitioners now ask this Court to disregard its jurisdictional holdings in Block and Mottaz, arguing that this Court's intervening decisions have made it harder to show that a restriction is jurisdictional and that under the new test the time bar here should be treated as just a claim-processing rule. For three reasons, the Court should reject that invitation. First, Block and Mottaz reflected this Court's considered and binding judgment that the time bar was jurisdictional and therefore merits stare decisis respect. In both cases, the Court cited earlier decisions that had recognized the strictly jurisdictional nature of comparable limits, and in both cases, the jurisdictional determination had concrete significance for the litigation before the Court. They were not mere drive-by jurisdictional rulings. Second, when Congress amended the Quiet Title Act in 1986, it ratified the jurisdictional determinations of not only this Court but also of the courts of appeals, which had uniformly agreed that the time bar was strictly jurisdictional. Third and finally, revisiting the time bar's jurisdictional status would cause unnecessary disruption. At a broad level, it would leave the lower courts confused about when they have to comply with this Court's applications of governing law. And at a narrower level, Petitioners' rule would just delay the resolution of disputed timeliness questions, preventing their resolution as threshold issues and instead requiring potentially meaningless trials on the merits of decades-old easements and property lines.

If -- if we can achieve racial diversity through neutral mechanisms rather than through race-conscious mechanisms, we should. We've said that many times. So the question is, when can we say that we can achieve our racial diversity goals in that way? And I guess I have a two-part question and -- and then an assumption that I want you to bake into the two parts. The first is, what is Harvard doing in an ongoing way to test whether that is true? And the second is, does Harvard see any progress along that dimension? In other words, I think it was said by Petitioner's counsel, oh, Harvard is doing -- you know, is putting this -- is -- is -- is using as great a preference as it ever did. And the question is, over time, has Harvard found that it has become less necessary to use race-conscious means or not? Here's the assumption that I want to have you bake into this, which is I take Petitioners to be saying, and I think that this is an important thing, that it doesn't matter if some part of the reason for adopting race-neutral approaches is to achieve racial diversity. I think that they very clearly said that. I'm not sure I understand why given their legal arguments, but I think that they very clearly said that. So assume that you can, you know, sit down and say we're -- we're -- we're -- we're trying to figure out what race-neutral mechanisms to use, and part of the goal is to achieve racial diversity.

Waxman</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The evidence and findings in this case confirm what this Court has long recognized, that a university student body comprising a multiplicity of backgrounds, experiences, and interests vitally benefits our nation, stereotypes are broken down, prejudice is reduced, and critical thinking and problem-solving skills are improved. Student body diversity makes our businesses more innovative and globally competitive, our scientists more creative, our medical professionals more effective, and our military more cohesive. Experience has more than borne out Justice Powell's observation that our future as a country depends on having leaders who have enjoyed wide exposure to students as diverse as the nation itself. And so, as this Court has consistently held, if necessary to achieve genuine diversity, a university need not blind itself to race, which like the type of high school an applicant attended, their socioeconomic and family background or the part of the country they live in, forms a part of who they are. Now SFFA attempts to use Harvard's admissions program as some sort of proof that settled constitutional precedent is egregiously wrong, but while SFFA is fully entitled to its own legal arguments, it is not entitled to its own facts. Following exhaustive discovery in this case, the trial court considered the testimony of 30 witnesses and detailed expert analysis and made extensive meticulous findings which the court of appeals robustly affirmed, and those findings, applying strict scrutiny, are that Harvard does not improperly emphasize race in its admissions decisions, it does not engage in racial balancing, it most certainly does not discriminate against Asian American applicants, and it does not yet have a current workable race-neutral alternative. The false narrative to which SFFA clings is no basis to dismantle decades of precedent confirming the constitutionality of limited race consciousness in admissions.

First, Grutter assumed that race would only be a plus. But race is a minus for Asians, a group that continues to face immense racial discrimination in this country.

The foundational points here are not in dispute. First, the conceded and obvious act of international terrorism is the Reina attack, and the complaint includes no allegation that the defendants provided substantial assistance, much less knowing substantial assistance, to that attack or, for that matter, to any other attack. Second, as the complaint concedes, the defendants ""had no intent to aid ISIS's terrorist activities."" Quite to the contrary, they maintained and regularly enforced policies prohibiting content that promotes terrorist activity. The plaintiff's claim that because defendants were generally aware that among their billions of users were ISIS adherents who violated their policies and, therefore, defendants should have done more to enforce those policies does not constitute aiding and abetting an act of international terrorism under the operative terms of the text, the constitutional principles articulated in Halberstam, or any recognized understanding of what it means to abet a criminal act. If Congress had wanted to impose treble damage liability for existing -- assisting a terrorist organization, it had a ready model in the material support statute, Section 2339B. If it had wanted to create such liability for supporting international terrorism writ large, it likewise had a model in Section 2331(1). Instead, it provided a remedy against those who conspire with terrorists or -- or who knowingly aid and abet acts of terrorism.
