Snyder</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  For decades, the courts of appeals have consistently recognized that the six-year statute of limitations on an APA claim accrues at the time of the challenged agency action, not the time when a particular plaintiff comes within the relevant statute's zone of interests. In asking this Court to reject that settled practice, Corner Post argues that the word ""accrues"" in Section 2401(a) invariably refers to a time at which a specific plaintiff obtains a complete and present cause of action and that every newly formed entity therefore has six years to challenge any prior agency actions that affect its business or other interests, even if those actions occurred decades ago. Nothing in the APA or Section 2401(a) requires that destabilizing result. In Crown Coat Front Company, this Court explicitly rejected Corner Post's one-size-fits-all definition of ""accrues,"" warning of the hazards of attempting to devise a single accrual rule for all purposes. Instead, the Court explained that to apply the general word ""accrues"" a court has to  consider the particular type of claim at issue and how the practical purposes of a statute of limitations apply in that context. In conducting that necessary analysis, courts should give primary weight to evidence about the accrual rule that Congress itself has adopted when it has specifically focused on other claims of the same type. Doing so ensures that courts are not just engaged in their own policy balancing about the respective costs of review and repose but instead are faithfully following Congre ss's lead. Here, Congress's standard practice when it's focused on the time for challenging an agency action has been to run the limitations period for that type of claim from the date of the agency action at issue. It would, therefore, reasonably have expected courts to follow the same approach when  applying Section 2401(a)'s catch-all statute of limitations to claims under the APA, and because that's what the court of appeals did here, the decision  below should be affirmed.

If you win on the precise -- on the question on which we granted cert, which is whether there is a total exemption for legislative enactment -- so let's assume for the sake of argument that the Court were to agree with you on that, and so there has to be an application of whatever the test is to legislative enactments.

And -- and my question is whether you think that the test that applies to a legislative enactment that applies to a category of property should be the same as the one that applies in the permitting process, where there is an individualized determination. So let me give you two examples. You have a law like this that imposes a fee, a -- a -- a particular fee, a set fee, on anybody who builds a tiny house, like 500 square feet. I don't know how many square feet a tiny house has, but a tiny house, okay? Everybody -- they do a study and they figure out that people on average who have these tiny houses have X number of cars and they calculate that.

So let's imagine that instead of tying this traffic impact exaction to granting the permit, let's say that your client builds the home and then, after that, so a permit's been granted and fallen out of the picture, the county comes back and says, we're going to have a special assessment applicable to everybody in this development of X amount of money, say it's the same 20 whatever thousand dollars that your client paid to cover traffic impacts. Does that implicate Nollan/Dolan?","<speaker>Paul J. Beard II</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The county refused to give George Sheetz a permit to build a home unless he paid a substantial fee to finance public road improvements. He was faced with an impossible choice: the taking of over $23,000 or the ability to use his land. Though the fee went beyond mitigation, he did submit to the fee and paid under protest. After all, the permit was worth far more than the fee. That's the same improper leveraging that led to this Court's rule in Nollan, Dolan, and Koontz that all permit exactions should be subject to heightened scrutiny. Such review is needed to ensure that the government is not committing a taking in the guise of the police power to mitigate for land use impacts. Yet, the lower court refused to apply Nollan/Dolan simply because the fee came from a legislative, preset, generally applicable schedule that the county had adopted. The decision below is as wrong as it is dangerous. First, nothing in the Court's exactions precedents, the Takings Clause, or the unconstitutional conditions doctrine justifies that broad exception. Second, it's a perversion of Nollan and Dolan to say that because an exaction is generally applicable, therefore, it requires no heightened review. The exact opposite is true. Such an exaction only amplifies the risk that the government hasn't tailored its exaction to a project's impacts, and that cries out for Nollan/Dolan review. Finally, upholding the lower court's decision would just invite the government to monetize across the country all of their permit exactions and to preset legislative fees in order to escape heightened review.

So, for example, the Due Process Clause. It sounds to me like you were making a procedural due process argument when you said the burden-shifting is the problem in response to Justice Kagan. At one point, you said, you know, this is about keeping the government honest. There are other claims in the law that do that work, right?

As the findings below make clear, the programmatic fee in this case does not pay for road improvements generally. It pays for only those improvements necessary to alleviate increased traffic from new development. Neither precedent nor principle supports, much less compels, applying Nollan/Dolan's individualized test to those programmatic fees. In centuries' worth of precedent, this Court has reiterated that governments can charge fees to property owners, such as special assessments to fund public improvements and user fees to fund government services. This Court has always held that those fees, which are indistinguishable from the fee at issue, are not takings. Without that predicate for application of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, Nollan/Dolan cannot apply. More fundamentally, the county's impact fee shares all of the key features with the other property taxes, user fees, and similar property-based charges that this Court has cordoned off from Nollan/Dolan review. It is imposed by the legislature subject to an array of state law requirements and applies to all similar new development in the county based on the legislature's finding that new development creates the need for and will benefit from the road improvements the fee will fund. And, critically, it does not attempt to obtain any dedication of real property. Petitioner would disregard those limiting features and expand Nollan/Dolan to commonplace impact fees. But doing so would have dire consequences for land use planning. Forcing local governments to justify a programmatic fee on a parcel-by-parcel basis would disrupt, if not destroy, their ability to fund capital-intensive infrastructure necessary to serve new development, bringing such development to a grinding halt.

They all have some requirement that a prohibited factor came into a decision and that it was there in your head when you made the decision. But what all of our decisions have recognized is the tent -- intent is a very difficult thing to prove, and, as a result of that, what Congress has done, and sometimes this Court has done it, has set up burden-shifting mechanisms. You do this first. Then we'll give you a chance to do that. They're all -- those burden-shifting mechanisms are geared to trying to figure out what was in his head when he made the decision. Was the prohibited consideration in his head in the requisite way? But, because that's hard to say directly, we'll shift burdens and tell different people to do different things. And that's exactly what this statute does and says that's the way you figure out whether the whistleblowing activity was in his head in the prohibited way.","<speaker>Easha Anand</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the wake of the Enron meltdown to encourage whistleblowers to report misconduct that could threaten the finances of millions.

Someone engages in protected activity or a report of misconduct and then a few weeks later, a few months later, is fired. Then the case goes to the litigation and the jury, and the plaintiff says: I was fired because I engaged in the protected activity. The employer, as here, comes in and says: No, we fired you because you were a poor performer or because we had money issues and needed to eliminate the position. Then, at that point and in this case, in the closing arguments, you know, your counsel said you're going to hear two different versions of events. And then Murray's counsel got up and said, you just heard a speech. It was a slick presentation for sure, but it was not the truth. It's a smoke screen. In other words, the jury had to decide between two different versions of events, which the burden was on you to show that your version was correct, but you were able to present to the jury this idea that no, we didn't do it, we didn't intend to do it because of the protected activity.

Simpson</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The most fundamental principle of double jeopardy law, going back hundreds of years before even the adoption of the Constitution, is that if a jury in a court with jurisdiction returns a verdict of acquittal, that that verdict is final. It may not be -- the defendant may not be subjected to a second prosecution ever, no questions, end of discussion. This case is the paradigm in which that example applies or that principle applies. Mr. McElrath went to trial before a jury in Georgia. The jury found him not guilty of malice murder by reason of insanity. No one has questioned that that jury deliberated in accordance with Georgia processes. It returned a verdict in return -- in accordance with Georgia processes. The State and the defendant both affirmatively indicated they had no objection to the form of the verdict. The court accepted it and entered judgment. Accordingly, that is the end of it as far as the malice murder charge is concerned. The State contends that Mr. McElrath can be subjected to a second trial because that acquittal is repugnant to a conviction on separate offenses. And this Court's analysis has always been offense by offense. He was found guilty but mentally ill as to felony murder and guilty but mentally ill as to aggravated assault. This repugnant verdict exception to the double jeopardy principle does not stand, cannot withstand analysis. The State really makes two arguments. The first is that this Court's inconsistent verdict cases do not apply because they're -- there's a difference between a repugnant verdict and an inconsistent verdict and, in particular, that with a repugnant verdict, there is no uncertainty as to what the jury did. That is wrong as a factual matter because the uncertainty is the same, but, more importantly, it does not matter because an acquittal is final regardless.

But, unlike Bantam and the case that you'll hear next, this is not a typical suit where a speaker challenges government actions affecting its own speech.

But, unlike Bantam and the case that you'll hear next, this is not a typical suit where a speaker challenges government actions affecting its own speech. Instead, two states and five individuals are trying to use the Article III courts to audit all of the executive branch's communications with and about social media platforms. That problem has infected every step of this case. Respondents don't have standing at all because they have not shown an imminent threat that the government will cause a platform to moderate their posts in particular. But the lower courts still reviewed a vast range of speech by different officials to different platforms about different topics at different  times without asking whether it had anything to do with Respondents. And the courts then entered a universal injunction restricting speech about any content posted on any platform by anyone and binding thousands of officials, including presidential advisors speaking to the public and FBI agents trying to protect the nation from foreign threats. Even apart from the Article III problem, that injunction rests on two fundamental legal errors. First, the Fifth Circuit radically expanded the state action doctrine by holding that even concededly non-coercive communications, like the CDC's public health advice, can transform private platforms' editorial choices into state action. And, second, the Fifth Circuit mistook persuasion for coercion. It held that the FBI's communications are inherently coercive because  the FBI is a law enforcement agency, a theory that even Respondents don't defend in this  Court, and it held that White House officials engaged in coercion because they used strong language or referred in a general way to legal reforms in response to press questions. If this Court reaches the merits, it should reaffirm that government speech crosses the line into coercion only if, viewed objectively, it conveys a threat of adverse government action.

The district court, which analyzed this record for a year, described it as arguably the most massive attack against free speech in American history, including the censorship of renowned scientists opining in their areas of expertise. And the government's levers of pressure are anathema to the First Amendment. Behind closed doors, the government badgers the platforms 24/7, it abuses them with profanity, it warns that the highest levels of the White House are concerned, it ominously says that the White House is considering its options, and it accuses platforms both of playing total Calvinball and of hiding the ball, all to get the platforms to censor more speech. Under this  onslaught, the platforms routinely cave. Now, last month, in the NetChoice cases, the platforms told you that it's  incredibly important that they create their own content moderation policies. But this record shows that they continually depart from those  policies because of unrelenting government pressure. Indeed, as Facebook recently disclosed in an internal email to former UK Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, the reason Facebook did that was ""because we were under pressure by the administration. We shouldn't have done it.""  Now my friend says all this is constitutional because the government has the right to persuade using the bully pulpit. But the government has no right to persuade platforms to violate Americans' constitutional rights, and pressuring platforms in back rooms shielded from public view is not using the bully pulpit at all.

And so that's why I keep coming back to the actual underlying First Amendment issue, which we can isolate in this case and just talk about -- about coercion, but I think there -- that you have to admit that there are certain circumstances in which the government can provide information, encourage the platforms to take it down, tell them to take it down. I mean, what about  --what about the hypo of someone posting classified information?

IHS takes the appropriated funds it would have otherwise spent on the federal program and transfers those funds to the tribe in exchange for the tribe's promise to use them to provide the same level of services, and ISDA obligates IHS to add to that core secretarial amount contract support costs to plug specific gaps the secretarial amount does not cover.

Those issues were never raised or decided below, and reaching them is not necessary to resolve the circuit split targeted by the Court's actual question presented. Assuming Respondents' claims are timely under the discovery rule, Respondents are entitled to seek damages as a remedy for those claims. Section 507(b) makes no distinction between claims seeking the remedy of damages and claims seeking other forms of rel ief. Section 504 is entitled ""Remedies for Infringement,  Damages, and Profits,"" and it expressly says that a copyright owner is entitled to recover the actual damages suffered by him, any profits of the infringer, or statutory damages for all infringements involved in the action. There is  no damages bar for copyright claims in Title 17. Now Congress has enacted three-year lookback damages bars as narrow exceptions elsewhere in Title 17, but Congress needed to add those as narrow exceptions precisely because there is no damages bar in Title 17 as a general rule. Nor would a judicially created damages bar be permissible. In Petrella, this Court held that if a copyright claim is timely under the statute of limitations, again, as is assumed here, courts are not at liberty to impose equitable-based time limits on the recovery of damages for those claims. Now, to be sure, in Petrella, recovery was limited to infringements committed during the three years before the complaint was filed. But that was because, under a laches case like that one and any other laches case, earlier claims which separately accrue were and will become time-barred under the statute of limitations when the plaintiff doesn't sue on them. That is how the statute of limitations takes account of delay. It bars claims if  they're not brought within three years of when they accrue. But, if a copyright claim is brought within three years of when it accrues and, thus, is timely under the statute of limitations, damages must be available as a remedy.

As a straightforward matter of statutory interpretation, the answer to that question here is no. Under the applicable statute of limitations, a civil action must be brought within three years after the claim accrued. A claim accrues when the plaintiff has a complete cause of action. Accordingly, as this Court repeatedly stated in Petrella, a plaintiff can obtain damages for acts of infringement only within three years of filing.

The debtor has no ongoing incentive after the plan is approved to limit the cost of defending, paying claims, and any liability on those claims. You lose it.

31480,2023.22-976-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," Mr. Fletcher, how does a machinegun  -- what would I have to do to fire a machinegun?","<speaker>Brian H. Fletcher</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. To fire a rifle fitted with a bump stock, the shooter simply places his trigger finger on the built-in finger ledge and uses his other hand to press the front of the rifle forward. As long as the shooter maintains that steady forward pressure, the rifle will fire continuously until it runs out of bullets, and it will empty a 100-round magazine like the ones used in the Las Vegas shooting in about 10 seconds. Those weapons do exactly what Congress meant to prohibit when it enacted the prohibition on machineguns, and those weapons are machineguns because they satisfy both disputed parts of the statutory definition. First, a rifle with a bump stock fires more than one shot by a single function of the trigger. In common usage today as in 1934, a  function of the trigger happens when some act by the shooter, usually a pull, starts a firing sequence. With a semiautomatic rifle, it fires  one shot for each function of the trigger because the shooter has to manually pull and release the trigger for every shot. But a bump stock eliminates those manual movements and  allows the shooter to fire many shots with one act, a forward push. Now Respondent says that a separate function of the trigger happens every time the trigger on a traditional rifle moves backwards and releases the hammer, even if it moves without any further manipulation by the shooter. But that is inconsistent with contemporaneous usage, does not account for guns with other kinds of triggers, and would make it trivially easy to evade the ban on mach ineguns just by automating the back-and-forth movement of the trigger after the shooter's initial pull. Second, a rifle with a bump stock fires more than one shot automatically, that is, through a self -regulating mechanism. Once the shooter presses forward to fire  the first shot, the bump stock uses the gun's recoil energy to create a continuous back-and-forth cycle that fires hundreds of shots per minute. Now Respondent says that  that cycle is not automatic because the shooter has to keep up  the forward pressure to keep the cycle going. But many traditional machineguns likewise  require the shooter to maintain backward pressure on the trigger to maintain continuous fire. Either way, a single motion both initiates and maintains a multi-shot sequence, and either way, the weapon is a machinegun. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2023,coherent,"{

To fire a rifle fitted with a bump stock, the shooter simply places his trigger finger on the built-in finger ledge and uses his other hand to press the front of the rifle forward. As long as the shooter maintains that steady forward pressure, the rifle will fire continuously until it runs out of bullets, and it will empty a 100-round magazine like the ones used in the Las Vegas shooting in about 10 seconds. Those weapons do exactly what Congress meant to prohibit when it enacted the prohibition on machineguns, and those weapons are machineguns because they satisfy both disputed parts of the statutory definition. First, a rifle with a bump stock fires more than one shot by a single function of the trigger. In common usage today as in 1934, a  function of the trigger happens when some act by the shooter, usually a pull, starts a firing sequence. With a semiautomatic rifle, it fires  one shot for each function of the trigger because the shooter has to manually pull and release the trigger for every shot. But a bump stock eliminates those manual movements and  allows the shooter to fire many shots with one act, a forward push. Now Respondent says that a separate function of the trigger happens every time the trigger on a traditional rifle moves backwards and releases the hammer, even if it moves without any further manipulation by the shooter. But that is inconsistent with contemporaneous usage, does not account for guns with other kinds of triggers, and would make it trivially easy to evade the ban on mach ineguns just by automating the back-and-forth movement of the trigger after the shooter's initial pull. Second, a rifle with a bump stock fires more than one shot automatically, that is, through a self -regulating mechanism. Once the shooter presses forward to fire  the first shot, the bump stock uses the gun's recoil energy to create a continuous back-and-forth cycle that fires hundreds of shots per minute. Now Respondent says that  that cycle is not automatic because the shooter has to keep up  the forward pressure to keep the cycle going. But many traditional machineguns likewise  require the shooter to maintain backward pressure on the trigger to maintain continuous fire. Either way, a single motion both initiates and maintains a multi-shot sequence, and either way, the weapon is a machinegun. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2023,coherent,"{

To fire a rifle fitted with a bump stock, the shooter simply places his trigger finger on the built-in finger ledge and uses his other hand to press the front of the rifle forward.

Those weapons do exactly what Congress meant to prohibit when it enacted the prohibition on machineguns, and those weapons are machineguns because they satisfy both disputed parts of the statutory definition. First, a rifle with a bump stock fires more than one shot by a single function of the trigger. In common usage today as in 1934, a  function of the trigger happens when some act by the shooter, usually a pull, starts a firing sequence. With a semiautomatic rifle, it fires  one shot for each function of the trigger because the shooter has to manually pull and release the trigger for every shot. But a bump stock eliminates those manual movements and  allows the shooter to fire many shots with one act, a forward push. Now Respondent says that a separate function of the trigger happens every time the trigger on a traditional rifle moves backwards and releases the hammer, even if it moves without any further manipulation by the shooter. But that is inconsistent with contemporaneous usage, does not account for guns with other kinds of triggers, and would make it trivially easy to evade the ban on mach ineguns just by automating the back-and-forth movement of the trigger after the shooter's initial pull. Second, a rifle with a bump stock fires more than one shot automatically, that is, through a self -regulating mechanism. Once the shooter presses forward to fire  the first shot, the bump stock uses the gun's recoil energy to create a continuous back-and-forth cycle that fires hundreds of shots per minute.

Mitchell</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The statutory definition of machinegun extends only to weapons that fire more than one shot automatically by a single function of the trigger. Mr. Cargill's non- mechanical bump stocks fall outside the statutory definition for two separate and independent reasons. First, a bump stock equipped rifle can fire only one shot per function of the trigger because the trigger must reset after every shot and must function again before another shot can be fired. The trigger is the device that initiates the firing of the weapon, and the function of the trigger is what that trigge ring device must do to cause the weapon to fire. The phrase ""function of the trigger"" can refer only to the trigger's function. It  has nothing to do with the shooter or what the shooter does to the trigger because the shooter does not have a function. The statute is concerned only with what the trigger does and whether a single function of that trigger produces more than one shot. Second, a bump stock equipped rifle does not and cannot fire more than one shot automatically by a  single function of the trigger because the shooter, in addition to causing the trigger to function, must also undertake additional manual actions to ensure a successful round of bump firing. Everything about the bump firing process is manual. And there is no automating device, such as a spring or a motor, in any of Mr. Cargill's non- mechanical bump stocks. The process depends entirely on human effort and exertion as the shooter must continually and repeatedly thrust the forestock of the rifle forward with his non -shooting hand while simultaneously maintaining backward  pressure on the weapon with his shooting ha nd. None of these acts are automated. And the Solicitor General has yet to identify any  component of Mr. Cargill's devices that automatically performs any task that is necessary for bump firing. The statute is  unambiguous as applied to Mr. Cargill's non- mechanical bump stocks, and we ask the Court to affirm on that ground.</text>",2023,coherent,"{

31968,2023.23-367-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Counsel, you mentioned that it's a small number of  --I forget exactly your framing -- that -- that, what, reached the question in court about the  application of the factors?","<speaker>Austin L. Raynor</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  I think the question in this case has narrowed considerably, so I'll just walk through the factors. First, on irreparable harm, in its opening brief, Petitioner fought the idea that the irreparable harm inquiry s hould focus on whether the Board is going to be able to remedy the harm at the end of its proceedings. At page 2 of its reply, it now concedes the focus is on the Board's remedial power. And I understood my friend to further concede that point in her argument this morning. Second, on harm, the question is not whether there is a certainty of harm. The question is whether there's a likelihood of harm. The test used by the Sixth Circuit is reasonably necessary. That's the Ahearn case. We think that's fully consistent with this Court's precedents. And as to whether all discharges count, we agree that not all unlawful discharges necessarily show irreparable harm. The question  that the Board looks at and the question that we think the Court should look at is whether that extinguishes the momentum of the union drive or  impairs it in such a serious way that an order from the Board a year or two down the road won't be able to restart the drive. Second, on public interest and the equities, our basic point here is that when Congress makes a judgment about what is in the public interest, the court cannot override that judgment in weighing the equities at that stage. This is the Oakland Cannabis case. The Court says, if Congress has made a judgment that something is unlawful, you can't basically make that thing lawful at the equities stage by refusing to enforce Congress's judgment. That doesn't mean that in some cases at the preliminary stage, if there's extremely compelling interests on the other side or public interests on the other side, that an injunction will automatically be necessary. But we think that in a case like this one, where Congress has made a judgment in  -- in a run-of -the-mine case, there's only going to be purely private profit -- profit motive interests on the other side, injunctive relief is typically going to be warranted. Again, I think Petitioner concedes  this basic point at page 13 of its reply. It says that courts are not entitled to revise Congress's judgment. Third, that leaves the merits, which I think has been the subject of a lot of discussion this morning. We think that the Court should take into account all relevant context. One piece of context is the statistics that Justice Jackson mentioned. The Board receives 20,000 unfair labor charges every year. It issues 750 complaints. Last year it authorized 14 petitions and filed seven. That's seven out of 20,000. We think that a court can properly take account of that in trying to make a predictive judgment about how the Board is going to come out. This ultimately is a predictive judgment. How is the Board going to come out? What is the likelihood of success before the Board?  And it's relevant that there is  substantial winnowing that goes on before the complaint is filed in district court. I think it's also relevant to note that the Board has approved the Section 10(j) petition. And just to clarify the separation of functions within the agency here, the general counsel is the prosecutorial arm to the Board. The Board members themselves are the adjudicative authority. But the statute, Section 10(j) itself, vests in the Board the power to approve a Section 10(j) petition. So before a 10(j) petition is filed in court, the Board itself has approved it. And that's relevant in making the predictive judgment about how this claim is likely to come out before the Board. The adjudicator has already preliminarily signalled its view of the merits. That doesn't mean the Board has made up its mind. It hasn't seen all the evidence, but that's a relevant consideration for the district court to think about in determining whether there is a likelihood of success on the merits.</text>",2023,coherent,"{

31970,2023.23-367-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," I -- I appreciate that point, but would you agree that the likelihood of success on the merits inquiry means likelihood of success on the merits in this case?","<speaker>Austin L. Raynor</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  I think the question in this case has narrowed considerably, so I'll just walk through the factors. First, on irreparable harm, in its opening brief, Petitioner fought the idea that the irreparable harm inquiry s hould focus on whether the Board is going to be able to remedy the harm at the end of its proceedings. At page 2 of its reply, it now concedes the focus is on the Board's remedial power. And I understood my friend to further concede that point in her argument this morning. Second, on harm, the question is not whether there is a certainty of harm. The question is whether there's a likelihood of harm. The test used by the Sixth Circuit is reasonably necessary. That's the Ahearn case. We think that's fully consistent with this Court's precedents. And as to whether all discharges count, we agree that not all unlawful discharges necessarily show irreparable harm. The question  that the Board looks at and the question that we think the Court should look at is whether that extinguishes the momentum of the union drive or  impairs it in such a serious way that an order from the Board a year or two down the road won't be able to restart the drive. Second, on public interest and the equities, our basic point here is that when Congress makes a judgment about what is in the public interest, the court cannot override that judgment in weighing the equities at that stage. This is the Oakland Cannabis case. The Court says, if Congress has made a judgment that something is unlawful, you can't basically make that thing lawful at the equities stage by refusing to enforce Congress's judgment. That doesn't mean that in some cases at the preliminary stage, if there's extremely compelling interests on the other side or public interests on the other side, that an injunction will automatically be necessary. But we think that in a case like this one, where Congress has made a judgment in  -- in a run-of -the-mine case, there's only going to be purely private profit -- profit motive interests on the other side, injunctive relief is typically going to be warranted. Again, I think Petitioner concedes  this basic point at page 13 of its reply. It says that courts are not entitled to revise Congress's judgment. Third, that leaves the merits, which I think has been the subject of a lot of discussion this morning. We think that the Court should take into account all relevant context. One piece of context is the statistics that Justice Jackson mentioned. The Board receives 20,000 unfair labor charges every year. It issues 750 complaints. Last year it authorized 14 petitions and filed seven. That's seven out of 20,000. We think that a court can properly take account of that in trying to make a predictive judgment about how the Board is going to come out. This ultimately is a predictive judgment. How is the Board going to come out? What is the likelihood of success before the Board?  And it's relevant that there is  substantial winnowing that goes on before the complaint is filed in district court. I think it's also relevant to note that the Board has approved the Section 10(j) petition. And just to clarify the separation of functions within the agency here, the general counsel is the prosecutorial arm to the Board. The Board members themselves are the adjudicative authority. But the statute, Section 10(j) itself, vests in the Board the power to approve a Section 10(j) petition. So before a 10(j) petition is filed in court, the Board itself has approved it. And that's relevant in making the predictive judgment about how this claim is likely to come out before the Board. The adjudicator has already preliminarily signalled its view of the merits. That doesn't mean the Board has made up its mind. It hasn't seen all the evidence, but that's a relevant consideration for the district court to think about in determining whether there is a likelihood of success on the merits.</text>",2023,coherent,"{

At page 2 of its reply, it now concedes the focus is on the Board's remedial power. And I understood my friend to further concede that point in her argument this morning. Second, on harm, the question is not whether there is a certainty of harm. The question is whether there's a likelihood of harm. The test used by the Sixth Circuit is reasonably necessary. That's the Ahearn case. We think that's fully consistent with this Court's precedents. And as to whether all discharges count, we agree that not all unlawful discharges necessarily show irreparable harm. The question  that the Board looks at and the question that we think the Court should look at is whether that extinguishes the momentum of the union drive or  impairs it in such a serious way that an order from the Board a year or two down the road won't be able to restart the drive. Second, on public interest and the equities, our basic point here is that when Congress makes a judgment about what is in the public interest, the court cannot override that judgment in weighing the equities at that stage. This is the Oakland Cannabis case. The Court says, if Congress has made a judgment that something is unlawful, you can't basically make that thing lawful at the equities stage by refusing to enforce Congress's judgment. That doesn't mean that in some cases at the preliminary stage, if there's extremely compelling interests on the other side or public interests on the other side, that an injunction will automatically be necessary. But we think that in a case like this one, where Congress has made a judgment in  -- in a run-of -the-mine case, there's only going to be purely private profit -- profit motive interests on the other side, injunctive relief is typically going to be warranted. Again, I think Petitioner concedes  this basic point at page 13 of its reply. It says that courts are not entitled to revise Congress's judgment. Third, that leaves the merits, which I think has been the subject of a lot of discussion this morning. We think that the Court should take into account all relevant context. One piece of context is the statistics that Justice Jackson mentioned. The Board receives 20,000 unfair labor charges every year. It issues 750 complaints. Last year it authorized 14 petitions and filed seven. That's seven out of 20,000. We think that a court can properly take account of that in trying to make a predictive judgment about how the Board is going to come out. This ultimately is a predictive judgment. How is the Board going to come out? What is the likelihood of success before the Board?  And it's relevant that there is  substantial winnowing that goes on before the complaint is filed in district court. I think it's also relevant to note that the Board has approved the Section 10(j) petition. And just to clarify the separation of functions within the agency here, the general counsel is the prosecutorial arm to the Board. The Board members themselves are the adjudicative authority. But the statute, Section 10(j) itself, vests in the Board the power to approve a Section 10(j) petition. So before a 10(j) petition is filed in court, the Board itself has approved it. And that's relevant in making the predictive judgment about how this claim is likely to come out before the Board. The adjudicator has already preliminarily signalled its view of the merits. That doesn't mean the Board has made up its mind. It hasn't seen all the evidence, but that's a relevant consideration for the district court to think about in determining whether there is a likelihood of success on the merits.</text>",2023,coherent,"{

You started, you said  -- you quoted Ms. Blatt's reply brief as to irreparable harm as to the equities and public interest. I -- I take it that you -- and I don't think that Ms. Blatt at all retreated from her reply brief today. So I take it that that's pretty much not at issue now and that the real question in dispute is whether the likelihood of success inquiry is ratcheted down somewhat. Is that what you understand the only issue in dispute to be?","<speaker>Austin L. Raynor</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  I think the question in this case has narrowed considerably, so I'll just walk through the factors. First, on irreparable harm, in its opening brief, Petitioner fought the idea that the irreparable harm inquiry s hould focus on whether the Board is going to be able to remedy the harm at the end of its proceedings. At page 2 of its reply, it now concedes the focus is on the Board's remedial power. And I understood my friend to further concede that point in her argument this morning. Second, on harm, the question is not whether there is a certainty of harm. The question is whether there's a likelihood of harm. The test used by the Sixth Circuit is reasonably necessary. That's the Ahearn case. We think that's fully consistent with this Court's precedents. And as to whether all discharges count, we agree that not all unlawful discharges necessarily show irreparable harm. The question  that the Board looks at and the question that we think the Court should look at is whether that extinguishes the momentum of the union drive or  impairs it in such a serious way that an order from the Board a year or two down the road won't be able to restart the drive. Second, on public interest and the equities, our basic point here is that when Congress makes a judgment about what is in the public interest, the court cannot override that judgment in weighing the equities at that stage. This is the Oakland Cannabis case. The Court says, if Congress has made a judgment that something is unlawful, you can't basically make that thing lawful at the equities stage by refusing to enforce Congress's judgment. That doesn't mean that in some cases at the preliminary stage, if there's extremely compelling interests on the other side or public interests on the other side, that an injunction will automatically be necessary. But we think that in a case like this one, where Congress has made a judgment in  -- in a run-of -the-mine case, there's only going to be purely private profit -- profit motive interests on the other side, injunctive relief is typically going to be warranted.

Next, courts should scour current and prior versions of the statute for any hint that Congress wanted the agency to have discretion, even if it later deleted the discretion-conferring language.

They all read like weighing ones. He found, while Wilkinson does provide emotional support, removing him would result in minimal emotional hardship because his son clearly has lived without Wilkinson's daily presence for most of his life because the mother had primary custody.

So, even if we assume that Guerrero, as I'll call it, says mixed questions count for questions of law, is it possible that there are certain kinds of mixed questions that Congress intended to include here and other kinds that it didn't? So my example is a scenario in which the defendant or the -- the petitioner is challenging the BIA's own rules with respect to how it applies this extreme and unusual hardship. So you say in your brief the BIA has looked at the statute and it has come up with factors that it says the IJs should be applying when it does this. If someone makes the claim that the BIA's factors are inconsistent with the statute insofar as they're applying it in this way in this case, I guess you could say that's a mixed question perhaps. Maybe it's closer to the question -- a pure question of law, but at least you're -- you're challenging the BIA's interpretation of the statute with respect to the factors that it has created. Justice Barrett has come up with a different kind of scenario where we agree on the facts of this case and we agree on the standards, the factors, that everybody's saying, hooray, BA -- BIA, you have it right with respect to what the IJ is supposed to be looking at, but the claim is that the IJ has not weighed these factors appropriately, that it has put more stock in a certain, you know, segment of it than another, and, Court, we really think you should reweigh it differently.

First, courts should see whether the standard has a common law origin. If so, the government suggests it's probably reviewable but doesn't commit either way. Next, courts should scour current and prior versions of the statute for any hint that Congress wanted the agency to have discretion, even if it later deleted the discretion-conferring language. If that doesn't somehow answer the question, courts should ask whether the standard requires evaluation and fact-weighing. They should then traipse through any version of the U.S. Code that -- that has ever existed looking for similarly worded standards and see if courts have ever labeled those discretionary. Taking these factors together, courts can then deem the standard a discretionary one -- a reviewable mixed question or an unreviewable discretionary one. It would be bad enough if the government were urging this test only for cancellation, but courts would have to apply it to dozens of INA standards, including whether a non-citizen has been rehabilitated, subjected to extreme cruelty, or violated the terms of a visa. I tried making a complete list last week and stopped count at 75. In other words, the government's test promises a never-ending supply of judicial review cases for this Court's merits docket. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2023,coherent,"{

What if Congress set it up in this way or that way, et cetera? But I sort of thought that the burden was on them to show that Congress can't set up the agency in this way, and the reason I think that is because of the language of the Appropriations Clause and the way in which it seems to give the legislature the prerogative of the purse.

So long as that there's any law that does that, that's consistent with the Appropriations Clause. Now the Solicitor General on rebuttal can clarify whether she thinks that's the correct test that we should apply or whether it's the one that I had previously thought she was advocating, which looks to whether something falls far outside Congress's historical practices.

Francisco</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about checks and balances. One of Congress's most important checks on executive power is its power of the purse. That's why Alexander Hamilton said that the unification of sword and purse was the very definition of tyranny. This case reflects precisely that feared unification. The government agrees that Congress couldn't just authorize the executive branch to spend whatever it wants. But that's effectively what Congress did here, where it authorized the CFPB to spend whatever it deems reasonably necessary in perpetuity, subject only to a cap so high it's almost never relevant, all for the very purpose of making this the most independent agency in American history. If it can do that, then it can authorize the President to spend whatever he deems reasonably necessary as long as he doesn't exceed $10 trillion, and that would work a sea change in the separation of powers. The government makes two basic arguments in response. First, it argues that that hypothetical would be unprecedented. But the CFPB is also unprecedented. Congress has never authorized an agency to pick its own perpetual appropriation, and if it can do that for the CFPB, it can do it for every other agency too. Second, the government points to founding-era fee-for-services agencies like the Post Office and their modern analogues. But none of those can demand whatever they want. Instead, they're limited to what they can collect from the people that they serve and regulate. That's why Congress rejected that model for the CFPB. They thought it made the agency too politically accountable. And if you jump the shark from those to this, then you have blessed a regime in which Congress can authorize the executive branch to spend whatever it wants to fund the entire government. In short, the Court should hold the line where it stands. Otherwise, it will have countenanced the very unification of sword and purse that the Constitution was designed to prevent.

But you're saying  -- you're saying no, it doesn't --  he doesn't have to know that it's unlawful; he has to know that it is unlawful or  -- fill in the blank.","<speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The federal government needs to ensure the money it appropriates to local governments for public benefits is allocated in a way that maximizes the benefits to its citizens, not the rewards for local officials. Congress, therefore, enacted Section 666 to bar officials from corruptly accepting payments with the intent to be influenced or rewarded in connection with their official duties. Petitioner asks this Court to weaken Section 666's protection for the public fisc by holding that a person does not violate Section 666 when he corruptly solicits a payment with the intent to be rewarded unless he has also agreed to accept the reward beforehand. But that requirement of a beforehand- agreement finds no basis in the statutory text. The plain meaning of ""reward"" readily covers a payment given in return for an official action or decision that is already complete. So a police chief who sends his officers to foil a burglary at a store and then demands the store owner pay him $10,000 for his officers' work, he acts with the intent to be rewarded. A safety inspector who issues a building permit for a dangerous project and then solicits a $30,000 payment acts with the intent to be rewarded. And a mayor who steers a contract for a particular business and then asks that business to pay him $13,000 for the contract acts with the intent to be rewarded, whether or not the contractor agreed to give him the reward before the contract closed. Petitioner's argument to the contrary ignores both the plain meaning of the term ""rewarded"" and the statutory history. In 1984, Congress enacted a flat bar on the acceptance of bribes and gratuities. It was modeled dire ctly on the one in Section 201(c) that applies to federal employees. In 1986, Congress narrowed that bar to carve out a subset of only the most culpable gratuities by adding a corruptly mens rea and an express exception for bona fide salary and benefits paid in the ordinary course of business. Now Congress's textual fix worked. Petitioners haven't pointed to any real -world examples of Section 666 prosecutions for the sort of innocuous gift -giving activity that occurs in the ordinary course of business, and I'm happy to explain why the  -- the two examples in their reply brief really just aren't what they are describing. But the Court should therefore reject Petitioner's invitation to artificially narrow the reach of Section 666. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2023,coherent,"{
