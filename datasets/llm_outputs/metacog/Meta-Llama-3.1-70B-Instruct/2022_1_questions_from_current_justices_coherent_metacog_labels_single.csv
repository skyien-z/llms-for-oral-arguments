8906,2022.22-58-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, I don't understand the states' argument to depend on the proposition that the executive must detain everybody even if it doesn't have the capacity to detain them. I understood their argument to be centered on something quite different. So let's just assume for the sake of argument that there isn't an issue about how many people you were going to detain but only a question about which ones you were going to detain. And the -- the problem that I see with your final memorandum is that Congress has established its own set of priorities and has said that certain categories of aliens must be detained, shall be detained. And the final memorandum says -- tells ICE officers don't do that. Don't detain anybody based solely on that person's criminal history. You must make a totality-of-the-circumstances decision about every single alien whom -- who you're considering for detention. Isn't that correct?","<speaker>Elizabeth B.

But the district court issued a sweeping ruling vacating the guidelines nationwide. This Court should reverse. First, the states lack standing. They argue states can challenge any federal policy that imposes even one dollar of indirect harms on their own taxing or spending. That theory has no limiting principle.

8907,2022.22-58-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"And so, therefore, it's sort of analogous to mandatory pretrial detention statutes, where Congress says, if you as a prosecutor determine that you're going to go after somebody, you're going to prosecute them in the criminal realm, there are certain people you have to detain during the prosecution. There are certain -- you know, people who have been convicted of certain crimes. We have statutes where Congress says those people have to be detained. But that doesn't speak to the antecedent determination of whether or not to prosecute those people. I think the problem that I'm seeing with the state's argument is that they appear to be conflating Congress's mandates with respect to detention and Congress's statements with respect to removal and that the idea of 1226 -- 1226(c) is that once the determination has been made pursuant to prosecutorial discretion that you're going to remove someone, if those people fall into the particular criminal alien categories, they have to be detained for the purpose of that removal.

And, as Justice Kagan pointed out in -- in Demore, we made very clear that there -- that that's a process, that it starts with the -- the -- the DHS's determination that they're going to seek removal and it ends ultimately with an order of removal. So it seems to me that (a) is talking about detention during the duration of that period. What you're saying is they can detain them prior to the United States' determination that they're even going to seek the person's removal and -- and I guess indefinitely until they make that decision?","<speaker>Judd E. Stone, II</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The states proved their standing at trial based on harms well recognized by this Court's precedents, prevailed on merits arguments grounded firmly in the INA's text, and received vacatur, the standard APA remedy. Petitioners respond by attempting to rewrite the law of Article III, the INA, and the APA. They are wrong. Petitioners call the states' standing illegitimate because -- because it is based on the costs states incur when Petitioners violate federal law. But such costs fall well within those held as sufficient in at least Massachusetts versus EPA and Department of Commerce. As this Court has recognized before, the states bear many of the consequences of federal immigration decisions. Those consequences fit comfortably in this Court's traditional Article III standing framework. On the merits, the final memorandum is unlawful for multiple reasons, most clearly because it treats Section 1226(c) as discretionary, while both this Court and every previous administration have acknowledged it as mandatory. Petitioners respond by appealing to resource constraints and their prosecutorial discretion, both of which are beside the point. The states do not claim the Petitioners must remove anyone in particular. Rather, Petitioners' detention obligations run only to -- arise before and after their decision to prosecute and run only to a small subset of this nation's illegal aliens. Finally, eliminating the APA's vacatur remedy would jettison nearly a century of administrative practice. When Congress empowered federal courts under Section 706 to set aside agency action, it authorized courts, consistent with pre-APA practice, to vacate unlawful rules, not merely to disregard them. This Court should not hold otherwise. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2022,coherent,"{

Was it the -- the Title VII as amended, or was it a guideline?","<speaker>Aaron M. Streett</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Title VII requires religious accommodations absent an undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. TWA versus Hardison violates the statute's promise that employees should not be forced to choose between their faith and their job. Hardison's de minimis test makes a mockery of the English language, and no party truly defends it today. Fortunately, Hardison's test is dicta as to Title VII, so the Court can and should construe ""undue hardship"" according to its plain text to mean significant difficulty or expense. But even if Hardison applied Title VII, its de minimis test lacks precedential force because it was barely considered by the Court, and its neutrality-based rationale has been devastated by Abercrombie. The government's new patchwork test is little better than Hardison's. It allows employers to deny accommodations far short of any fair meaning of ""undue hardship."" The government believes undue hardship arises whenever there is lost efficiency, weekly payment of premium wages, or denial of a coworker's shift preference. Thus, under the government's test, a diabetic employee could receive snack breaks under Title VII -- under the ADA but not prayer breaks under Title VII, for that might cause lost efficiency. An employee could receive weekly leave for pregnancy checkups but not to attend mass, for that might require denying a coworker's shift preference or paying premium wages.

With respect to the questions about the Establishment Clause and the shifting views as to what the Constitution permits, is there any impediment to Congress's acting now? I mean, setting aside the fact that there may have been -- that there's been a change in terms of the Court, presumably, Congress knows that and could change the statute now, right?","<speaker>Aaron M. Streett</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Title VII requires religious accommodations absent an undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. TWA versus Hardison violates the statute's promise that employees should not be forced to choose between their faith and their job. Hardison's de minimis test makes a mockery of the English language, and no party truly defends it today. Fortunately, Hardison's test is dicta as to Title VII, so the Court can and should construe ""undue hardship"" according to its plain text to mean significant difficulty or expense. But even if Hardison applied Title VII, its de minimis test lacks precedential force because it was barely considered by the Court, and its neutrality-based rationale has been devastated by Abercrombie. The government's new patchwork test is little better than Hardison's. It allows employers to deny accommodations far short of any fair meaning of ""undue hardship."" The government believes undue hardship arises whenever there is lost efficiency, weekly payment of premium wages, or denial of a coworker's shift preference. Thus, under the government's test, a diabetic employee could receive snack breaks under Title VII -- under the ADA but not prayer breaks under Title VII, for that might cause lost efficiency. An employee could receive weekly leave for pregnancy checkups but not to attend mass, for that might require denying a coworker's shift preference or paying premium wages. There's no reason religious workers should receive lesser protection than those covered by other accommodation statutes. We know a significant-difficulty-or- expense test works because several states, including New York and California, already apply that test for religious accommodations. And federal courts are well acquainted with applying that test under the ADA and other similar statutes. The Court should establish a textual test for undue hardship and reverse the judgment below.

The question in this case is whether that different meaning or message should play a role, any role, in the fair use analysis. Our answer is yes. Warhol's transformative meaning puts points on the board under Factor 1 of the four-factor balancing test. Goldsmith and the Second Circuit say no. Warhol's new meaning is categorically irrelevant and can't be considered as part of Factor 1 or any other factor. I want to emphasize three points. First, the precedent supports us. Campbell unambiguously requires an examination of meaning or message. Google reaffirms that test and cites Warhol's Soup Cans as a paradigmatic example of when it's satisfied. Goldsmith's test is at odds with both cases. Second, our approach, unlike Goldsmith's, maintains a balance between protecting artists' rights to monetize their works and encouraging new and important follow-on expression. We give follow-on artists credit for innovation at Factor 1 while recognizing that Factor 4 and the other factors will sometimes cut decisively the other way. Goldsmith's necessity test, by contrast, upends that balance. It banishes transformative meaning from the equation altogether, and by doing so, it violates 107's text, contradicts precedent, and undermines copyright's key goal, promoting creativity for the public good.

The jury instruction it agreed to in this case, on JA 113, states exactly that. If the government fails to establish proper venue for any count, you must find the defendant not guilty as to that count. The government's position is that this result should somehow differ when an appellate panel reviewing a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal finds that the jury erred in its determination and there is insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction. Put another way, the government's position is that when a jury does its job correctly and acquits, a defendant may not be reprosecuted, but, when the jury fails to correctly discharge its duty, the government gets a do-over. That is what this Court in Burks called a purely arbitrary distinction. The government has no real explanation for that result. It anchors its view on what it describes as a settled and unbroken practice of permitting retrials when a jury acquits for lack of venue. But there was no such practice. At both the common law and at the founding, the government's failure of proof as to venue resulted in a general verdict of acquittal, which carried all of the ordinary consequences of an acquittal. The rule the government relies on is instead the one this Court squarely rejected in Ball, that a prosecutor was entitled to a second bite at the apple even after a general verdict of acquittal on any ground by challenging the insufficiency of the indictment in the first trial. But, if the framers rejected that rule for purposes of the Fifth Amendment, they absolutely would have done so for violations of the venue right. As Justice Story explained, the venue right was an area where the framers sought to leave as little discretion in the government's hands as possible.

Petitioner got both of those remedies here. His contention here is that the Constitution requires an additional third remedy, which is immunity from reprosecution. But he hasn't identified a single word of the actual text of the Constitution that mandates that remedy. And we think centuries of prefounding history and precedent belie that contention. Now Petitioner mentioned this morning and in his briefing that juries are instructed to acquit a defendant if the government fails to prove venue, and he says that we haven't shown a founding era federal case in which a jury acquittal was followed by a retrial. I think that's a little bit of a strawman. A general verdict of acquittal always precludes retrial under double jeopardy principles. We have never contested that. But that's not this case. He was not acquitted by the jury. He was convicted. The question is what happens when a reviewing court determines that a conviction was obtained in the wrong venue. Of course, there's no founding era precedent on that because, as my friend mentioned, there was no right of appeal in federal criminal cases until 1889 for defendants and 1907 for the government. But Petitioner's case basically boils down to, from start to finish, a conflation of a jury's general verdict of acquittal and a reviewing Court's determination that a conviction was improper or the result of constitutional error. This Court has squarely rejected that conflation, including in Scott, which was one of the trilogy of double jeopardy cases decided the same day as Burks. And what the Court said in Scott was that, look, a general verdict of acquittal doesn't give reasons, and so we adopt a defendant-friendly categorical rule that a general verdict of acquittal is final and preclusive. That's not true when a court decides something. When a court decides something, the dividing line for whether retrial is or is not permissible is whether the legal basis for the ruling goes to factual guilt or innocence or criminal culpability, as Evans against Michigan said. Venue does not go to factual guilt or innocence. It does not go to criminal culpability. And, therefore, retrial is not forbidden. I welcome the Court's questions.

11461,2022.21-984-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"Mr. Clement, can I ask you about the relationship between 601 and the rest of the EAP exemption regulation? Your question presented suggests that it's stand-alone and you use that term. And I was a little concerned about it because, when I look at the structure of the entire regulation, when you start at the beginning, at its title, it says this is defining and delimiting the exemptions for executive, administrative, professional, computer, and outside sales employees. It doesn't say highly compensated employees. When you look at the subparts of the regulation, they have a subpart for executive, a subpart for administrative, a subpart for professional, a subpart for computer. There's no subpart for highly compensated. And the government says highly compensated is actually just a subset of these other categories. It is the fact that, you know, a person who is in each of these other categories, with the exception of computers, has to be paid on a salary basis. And some of those people are going to be making much more than the $455 minimum. Those are the ones we'll call highly compensated for the purpose of 601 and allow them to have this shortcut through. So can you talk a little bit about why it is -- first of all, does Mr. Hewitt satisfy any of the other parts of this regulation? You hone right in on 601. And what is -- how are we to understand that this is really about the kind of employee who, in my view, would have the regularity and predictability of a salary versus what some people have called the kind of ""eat what you kill"" dynamic, that you only get paid when you work and not a dollar more?","<speaker>Paul D.

He is thus exempt from the overtime laws under the specialized streamlined exemption for highly compensated workers set forth in Section 601. Respondent nonetheless insists that he's entitled to hundreds of thousands of dollars in overtime because his substantial pay was calculated based on a day rate and, in many weeks, his total compensation was much larger than his guaranteed pay and, thus, he flunked the test of Section 604(b) and its reasonable relationship test. But Section 601 incorporates only the salary basis test of Section 602 and not the separate minimum guarantee plus extra rules of Section 604. Indeed, at the very moment that Section 601 was promulgated, the agency broke apart Section 602 and Section 604. Section 601 has never incorporated this minimum guarantee plus extra rules of Section 604 for very good reason. Section 601 itself addresses the questions of extras on top of the minimum guarantee and addresses them in terms that are both duplicative of Section 604(a) and contradictory of Section 604(b). In particular, the -- Section 601 authorizes total compensation to dwarf the minimum guarantee in terms that Section 604(b) would deem unreasonable. Worse still, Section 604 looks unfavorably on compensation in excess of the minimum guarantee, while Section 601 looks at the same thing, compensation in excess of the minimum guarantee, and says that's precisely what makes you highly compensated and, therefore, exempt.

Hansford</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The public has a right to every man's evidence. The attorney-client privilege creates an important but limited exception to that rule for communications seeking legal advice.

Employees send e-mails with trial data showing that a drug caused a serious side effect during trial or evidence that a new design for a car will sharply increase the rate of failure for the car's brakes. Sensitive business conversations with engineers and technical advisors and sales staff have to happen, and when they do, they can be critical evidence in subsequent court proceedings. All agree that such information is not and should not be privileged. But where a client combines a business communication with a request for legal advice or just the presence of an attorney to spot issues, as Justice Kagan indicated, courts need a test to see if the communication is more the kind that is seeking legal advice or more the kind that doesn't need the protection of the privilege. And reason and experience points to the primary purpose test, which has been used, as the discussion this morning indicates, for decades by a huge body of state and federal cases and has been endorsed by commentators from Wigmore to Rice. And I think that body of evidence powerfully rebuts Petitioner's assertion that it's too hard to apply the primary purpose test is what courts have been doing. Instead, Petitioner introduces a so-called freestanding significant purpose test, which, in its reply brief and, again, repeatedly this morning, Petitioner acknowledges is merely a bona fide legal purpose test. Any non-pretextual legal purpose, no matter how minor, will do. That approach would vastly expand attorney-client privilege to communications that are currently available to grand juries and to courts. Most directly relevant here, it would create an accountant-client privilege whenever a taxpayer can afford to hire an attorney to prepare his taxes, as I think the exchange with the Chief Justice indicates. And courts across the country have appropriately rejected any rule that allows a well-heeled taxpayer to buy their way into a privilege. I think, as the court of appeals recognized and for many of the reasons that Justice Sotomayor mentioned, for the 54 documents at issue here, this really was not a close case, and Petitioner's effort to expand attorney-client privilege to capture these documents should be rejected.

There, we faced the question and said, at least as to that definition, Congress was clear. So my problem with your point is even Rapanos, Justice Scalia, recognized, whether it's scientifically accurate or not, that what navigable waters can be is anything that's adjacent to what we think of as traditional navigable waters. No one's suggesting you can put a boat on a wetland. It would sink. You can't put a boat of certain sizes or many near the shore line because they would sink. There's not enough water there to hold them up. So I don't understand how the wetland has to be navigable. It does have to be adjacent because it's part of that river. And Rapanos suggested it's hard to tell where the beginning of the wetland is and where the beginning of the -- of the water is. Whether that's true or not is irrelevant. Congress defined the term as navigable waters and adjacent wetlands. So, if I take that as their definition, why don't we say that something that is near qualifies?

Fletcher</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the discussion so far illustrates, everyone agrees that the waters protected by the Clean Water Act include some adjacent wetlands. The narrow but important question presented in this case is whether wetlands lose protection if they're separated from other waters by a barrier like a berm or a road. Overwhelming scientific evidence and essentially undisputed scientific evidence shows that those sorts of barriers do not diminish wetlands' essential role in protecting the integrity of other waters. And as Justice Kavanaugh emphasized, for 45 years, the EPA and the Army Corps have recognized that the presence of such a barrier does not categorically strip a wetland of the Act's protections. This Court should uphold that longstanding interpretation for three reasons. First, in 1977, Congress was presented with proposals to limit the Act's coverage that sounded very much like the proposal that you just heard, and it rejected them. Instead, it adopted Section 1344(g), which includes express textual recognition that the waters covered by the Act include adjacent wetlands. The Court recognized in SWANCC, in the language that Justice Sotomayor quoted, that that was an unequivocal approval of the Corps's regulation on adjacent wetlands. Second, this Court unanimously upheld those regulations in Riverside Bayview. Now it's true that the marsh at issue in that case happened to directly abut a creek such that one could wade from one and then swim in the other. But the Court did not rely on any difficulty in identifying the boundary between the creek and the lake, and there wasn't one. Instead, the Court relied on what it called the agency's ecological judgment that wetlands significantly affect neighboring waters. And the presence of a berm or other barrier does not sever that connection. In fact, as the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Act emphasized, the presence of a river berm can itself be evidence of the close connection between the river and the neighboring wetlands. Third and finally, the agencies are now doing what members of this Court have repeatedly urged them to do by promulgating regulations that recognize and appropriately limit the coverage of the Act.

So --,"<speaker>Damien M. Schiff</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It's now going on 16 years since Petitioners Mike and Chantell Sackett began construction of a house on a vacant lot in a largely built-out subdivision. Yet, their home-building plans remain on hold to this day because EPA remains steadfast in its view that their property contains navigable waters, subject to regulation under the Clean Water Act. But under no plausible interpretation of that term does the agency have such authority. Now the statute defines ""navigable waters"" as the waters of the United States and so explicitly requires that EPA establish two things before it may regulate. First, there must be a water, that is, a hydro-geographic feature that in ordinary parlance would be referred to as a type of stream, creek, river, lake, or the like. A wetland, however, is none of those things, and so it can be regulated as a water only to the extent that it blends into and thus becomes indistinguishable from an abutting water. Second, the water has to be of the United States, that is, for all practical purposes, a navigable in fact water. Now this test is vastly superior to the significant nexus test for a number of reasons. First and most importantly, the two-step framework closely adheres to the textual limits that Congress itself imposed on the agency. Second, by faithfully adhering to those limits, the test faithfully vindicates all of Congress's purposes, not just its water-quality purposes, but also its desire to preserve the state's traditional preeminence over land and water resources. And, thirdly, it's an easy-to-administer test. Ordinary citizens can use their own eyes to reliably determine whether or not their land is regulated. And under this two-step framework, it's clear that the Sacketts' property contains no waters, much less waters of the United States, and so they should be entitled to a declaration that their property is not subject to EPA's authority.</text>",2022,coherent,"{

So you -- you have to have some limiting principle.

He must remain in prison despite having done nothing wrong. But, as this Court held in Davis, conviction and punishment for an act that the law does not make criminal inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice. The Eighth Circuit's ruling is wrong for four separate reasons. First, it violates the text of 2255(e). Its key terms all indicate that traditional habeas relief should be available, that a prisoner should have one opportunity to have the correct law applied to his case. The Eighth Circuit held, however, that so long as 2255 provides a purely formal opportunity to raise an issue, it doesn't matter whether the law applied is correct or wrong. Prisoners in this situation, moreover, do not even have that purely formal opportunity. They will almost always be barred from raising the issue in their initial 2255 motion. Second, the Eighth Circuit made the savings clause almost completely superfluous. It identified two categories of cases where it believed the saving clause applies. But the savings clause actually applies to neither. In both situations, the prisoner petitions under 2241 directly. Third, the Eighth Circuit created four independent constitutional difficulties. It effectively suspended an important use of the writ as originally understood, and it raised substantial due process, separation of powers, and Eighth Amendment concerns. It denied Jones any opportunity to ever test his claim under what has always been the correct law. Finally, the Eighth Circuit wrongly concluded that allowing savings clause relief would undermine Section 2255(h). It does not. The saving clause and 2255(h) are independent, congressionally authorized routes to collateral review, and nothing suggests that in enacting Section 2255(h) in 1996 Congress intended to repeal the savings clause. The Eighth Circuit's repeal by implication isn't justified. Your Honors, the Eighth Circuit here moved that because the prisoner had a theoretical right to raise an opportunity -- had the right to raise an opportunity in his initial 2255 motion, which was for -- which substantively was foreclosed under existing circuit precedent, which this Court later declared wrong, the possibility of en banc review or a cert petition to this Court made his quest to have the correct law applied real.

He must remain in prison despite having done nothing wrong. But, as this Court held in Davis, conviction and punishment for an act that the law does not make criminal inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice. The Eighth Circuit's ruling is wrong for four separate reasons. First, it violates the text of 2255(e). Its key terms all indicate that traditional habeas relief should be available, that a prisoner should have one opportunity to have the correct law applied to his case. The Eighth Circuit held, however, that so long as 2255 provides a purely formal opportunity to raise an issue, it doesn't matter whether the law applied is correct or wrong. Prisoners in this situation, moreover, do not even have that purely formal opportunity. They will almost always be barred from raising the issue in their initial 2255 motion. Second, the Eighth Circuit made the savings clause almost completely superfluous. It identified two categories of cases where it believed the saving clause applies. But the savings clause actually applies to neither. In both situations, the prisoner petitions under 2241 directly. Third, the Eighth Circuit created four independent constitutional difficulties. It effectively suspended an important use of the writ as originally understood, and it raised substantial due process, separation of powers, and Eighth Amendment concerns. It denied Jones any opportunity to ever test his claim under what has always been the correct law. Finally, the Eighth Circuit wrongly concluded that allowing savings clause relief would undermine Section 2255(h). It does not. The saving clause and 2255(h) are independent, congressionally authorized routes to collateral review, and nothing suggests that in enacting Section 2255(h) in 1996 Congress intended to repeal the savings clause.

They -- they're -- they're saying you can bring a second and successive petition if there's newly discovered evidence or if there's a new rule of constitutional law that's made retroactive and therefore would apply to you. Those two kinds of scenarios in which Congress is making very clear that they wanted people to be able to get past the second or successive bar seem to me to be substantively very similar to what is happening here to Mr. Jones.

But, as this Court held in Davis, conviction and punishment for an act that the law does not make criminal inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice. The Eighth Circuit's ruling is wrong for four separate reasons. First, it violates the text of 2255(e). Its key terms all indicate that traditional habeas relief should be available, that a prisoner should have one opportunity to have the correct law applied to his case. The Eighth Circuit held, however, that so long as 2255 provides a purely formal opportunity to raise an issue, it doesn't matter whether the law applied is correct or wrong. Prisoners in this situation, moreover, do not even have that purely formal opportunity. They will almost always be barred from raising the issue in their initial 2255 motion. Second, the Eighth Circuit made the savings clause almost completely superfluous. It identified two categories of cases where it believed the saving clause applies. But the savings clause actually applies to neither. In both situations, the prisoner petitions under 2241 directly. Third, the Eighth Circuit created four independent constitutional difficulties. It effectively suspended an important use of the writ as originally understood, and it raised substantial due process, separation of powers, and Eighth Amendment concerns.

What I'm still not so clear on is why 2555 could not be working if, because of one of its provisions, it's, you know, unconstitutional or it doesn't allow you or doesn't allow for actually innocent people to have one clear shot at relief. Like why isn't that a species of 2255 is not working and, therefore, you need to be in the habeas lane?","<speaker>Daniel R. Ortiz</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Eighth Circuit ruled in this case that someone in prison for something the court later determines has never been a crime has no means to challenge his continued detention once his opportunity to file a 2255 motion runs out. He must remain in prison despite having done nothing wrong. But, as this Court held in Davis, conviction and punishment for an act that the law does not make criminal inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice. The Eighth Circuit's ruling is wrong for four separate reasons. First, it violates the text of 2255(e). Its key terms all indicate that traditional habeas relief should be available, that a prisoner should have one opportunity to have the correct law applied to his case. The Eighth Circuit held, however, that so long as 2255 provides a purely formal opportunity to raise an issue, it doesn't matter whether the law applied is correct or wrong. Prisoners in this situation, moreover, do not even have that purely formal opportunity. They will almost always be barred from raising the issue in their initial 2255 motion. Second, the Eighth Circuit made the savings clause almost completely superfluous. It identified two categories of cases where it believed the saving clause applies. But the savings clause actually applies to neither. In both situations, the prisoner petitions under 2241 directly. Third, the Eighth Circuit created four independent constitutional difficulties. It effectively suspended an important use of the writ as originally understood, and it raised substantial due process, separation of powers, and Eighth Amendment concerns. It denied Jones any opportunity to ever test his claim under what has always been the correct law. Finally, the Eighth Circuit wrongly concluded that allowing savings clause relief would undermine Section 2255(h). It does not. The saving clause and 2255(h) are independent, congressionally authorized routes to collateral review, and nothing suggests that in enacting Section 2255(h) in 1996 Congress intended to repeal the savings clause.

12602,2022.22-196-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas,"You said that the testimony, the redacted testimony, functionally identified Petitioner and that the jury inferred that it would be the Petitioner. How is the inference and the functional identification testimonial here for Confrontation Clause considerations?","<speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Over 50 years ago, in Bruton versus United States, this Court held that the admission of a nontestifying defendant's confession that accuses another defendant in a joint trial violates the Confrontation Clause, even in the face of a limiting instruction, in light of the uniquely prejudicial effect that such a confession has on the jury. This Court has made clear that the Bruton rule applies to a confession that has been redacted to avoid naming another defendant where the jury is likely to infer that the confession implicated that defendant. The question presented today is whether the manner in which the redaction is carried out is dispositive of the application of the Bruton rule. The Court should hold that it is not. In this case, the prosecution substituted phrases like ""the other person"" for Petitioner's name, but, having done that, the prosecution used the confession functionally to identify Petitioner. The prosecution's questioning of the agent who took the confession left little doubt that the confessing defendant had named ""the other person."" Petitioner was the only defendant who plausibly could have been ""the other person."" The prosecution described the confession as some of the most crucial testimony in the case, and having elicited detailed testimony that ""the other person"" had met up and lived with the confessing defendant, the prosecution proceeded to present evidence that Petitioner had done just that. In light of those considerations, it is likely, indeed, inevitable, that the jury inferred that the confession here implicated Petitioner. In applying the Bruton rule, lower courts have considered the broader context without any evident difficulty, and doing so appropriately protects a defendant's confrontation right while working minimal prejudice to the government. The government's alternative approach would draw arbitrary and formalistic distinctions and permit ready circumvention of the Bruton rule, as this case illustrates.

12640,2022.22-196-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"So can I just have you give us your ask as cleanly as possible? Because you say that the lower courts have no problem, that they seem to be doing it fine. But you're the Petitioner here, and so I guess you're saying that the Second Circuit's four-corners rule is erroneous and that all we would need to say is something about don't just look at the face of the confession, courts can also consider the rest of the evidence at trial and the inferences that a jury could draw, as they ordinarily do in these other places. Is that what you're asking us to hold?","<speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Over 50 years ago, in Bruton versus United States, this Court held that the admission of a nontestifying defendant's confession that accuses another defendant in a joint trial violates the Confrontation Clause, even in the face of a limiting instruction, in light of the uniquely prejudicial effect that such a confession has on the jury. This Court has made clear that the Bruton rule applies to a confession that has been redacted to avoid naming another defendant where the jury is likely to infer that the confession implicated that defendant. The question presented today is whether the manner in which the redaction is carried out is dispositive of the application of the Bruton rule. The Court should hold that it is not. In this case, the prosecution substituted phrases like ""the other person"" for Petitioner's name, but, having done that, the prosecution used the confession functionally to identify Petitioner. The prosecution's questioning of the agent who took the confession left little doubt that the confessing defendant had named ""the other person."" Petitioner was the only defendant who plausibly could have been ""the other person."" The prosecution described the confession as some of the most crucial testimony in the case, and having elicited detailed testimony that ""the other person"" had met up and lived with the confessing defendant, the prosecution proceeded to present evidence that Petitioner had done just that. In light of those considerations, it is likely, indeed, inevitable, that the jury inferred that the confession here implicated Petitioner. In applying the Bruton rule, lower courts have considered the broader context without any evident difficulty, and doing so appropriately protects a defendant's confrontation right while working minimal prejudice to the government. The government's alternative approach would draw arbitrary and formalistic distinctions and permit ready circumvention of the Bruton rule, as this case illustrates.

12641,2022.22-196-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas,"Ms. Flynn, much of your argument sounds like Justice White's dissent in Bruton, and there's been some suggestion that if the Court -- if we rule your way, we are, in effect, overruling or undercutting Bruton. Would you think it would be -- would -- do you think it would be more straightforward to do precisely that, and are you asking us to do that?","<speaker>Caroline A. Flynn</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If the jury is instructed not to consider a piece of evidence against a criminal defendant and the jury follows that instruction, then there is no Confrontation Clause problem.

The Bruton exception to that principle simply holds that when it comes to a discrete category of statements, testimonial confessions by co-defendants that expressly name another defendant or are otherwise facially incriminating, we will no longer presume that the jury can obey that instruction. But this Court has taken care to treat the Bruton exception as narrow and it has repeatedly declined to extend it. The Court should decline Petitioner's request here too. First, confessions that replace a defendant's name with a natural-sounding noun or pronoun do not give rise to an overwhelming probability of juror disobedience.

12661,2022.22-196-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Isn't it true that there are two analytically pure, conceptually pure ways in which the fundamental issue here could be addressed? One -- but they both have their practical problems. One is to say, as was previously the rule, that if the jury is instructed to consider it only against the person who confessed, that cures the problem. The other is to recognize that this issue is never going to arise unless there is some risk or some reason to fear that the confession is going to be held by the jury against the nontestifying co-defendant because they just can't put that out of their minds. It's not realistic to expect them to do that. So those are -- if you -- you take either of those positions, you've got a -- you've got a clear rationale. But the Court has not done that. It has drawn lines between these two poles. And so it may be artificial to expect that when you draw that line, it's always going to be able to say why did you draw it there, because the rationale could push you further or it could push you back. So there hasn't been that much discussion here today about why -- both -- both are -- both of those -- the rejection of both of those is based on essentially practical concerns because, one -- one, it -- it was found in Bruton and the subsequent -- and in Gray to present too much of a risk for the defendant. And the other, I think, leads you to the conclusion you just can't have joint trials whenever this issue pops up. So why draw the line -- unless we're going to go to one extreme or the other, there's got to be a line. It's not going to be -- it's not going to be able to defend it on -- you know, say this is obviously exactly the right place.
