But -- but -- but understanding that our precedent recognizes congressional intent to allow the Board to develop a uniform body of law for the very -- various reasons that Justice Kagan pointed out, that might be a good thing, but at least it looks as though that's what Congress intended, all right? So, if that's the situation and now we have precedent that allows for that kind of Board taking the front lead on these things, I guess I'm a little confused about your suggestion that there is arguable protection versus actual protection as different kinds of analyses. I thought -- I thought that this is a spectrum that when it comes to the state court and the state court is asked to stand down, we have preemption, instead of having to litigate the whole issue and get to make the determination about whether the conduct is actually protected, the state court can look at it and say: Well, it looks arguable, and so that's enough.

There are both legal and practical reasons for so holding, and contrary to what Mr. Francisco has said, I don't think the Bill Johnson's decision stands in the way of that. If I could start with the legal reasons, the first and most important legal reason is this Court's decision in Longshoremen against Davis.

And, indeed, when we talk about libel, I think, you know, one of the first cases after New York Times v. Sullivan presented exactly that question, and the Court said a sanction is a sanction. Whether it's criminal or civil, it might have the same kind of chilling consequences.

36575,2022.21-468-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"Yes. Mr. Kneedler, you've said a couple of times that the Commerce Clause cannot allow for what it is that California is doing in this situation, and that sounds pretty categorical to me. And I know that you have been trying to disclaim any reliance on the sort of extraterritoriality principle, that you say we should proceed under Pike balancing. But -- but I also hear you making a claim that sounds to me like an extraterritoriality principle, and can I just focus your attention on that for a second? I think that the Petitioners have actually introduced two different kinds of extraterritoriality principle. In their briefs, they say that the rule should be that a state may not enact laws that have the practical effect of controlling conduct. And I worried about that when I read the brief because, to the extent we're talking about effect, then it introduces all kinds of questions, how much, how significant, and it doesn't sound like a bright-line rule anymore to me. But here today the Petitioners kind of move away a little bit from the controlling effect idea, and they say the per se rule should be essentially focused on the nature of the regulation, that the state law that conditions sales on out-of-state businesses operating in a certain way is the principle. And that's the one that you seem to be agreeing with. To the extent that you say that the problem is that a state who has a morality interest can't have a morality interest that is directed at the manner in which another state is conducting its business or other businesses are operating, why isn't that the same thing that the Petitioners are saying with respect to their extraterritoriality principle and, therefore, doesn't the government agree with them?","<speaker>Edwin S.

37159,2022.21-707-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"They can -- they can get -- they can give pluses. And so what I'm worried about is that the rule that you're advocating, that in the context of a holistic review process, a university can take into account and value all of the other background and personal characteristics of other applicants, but they can't value race, what I'm worried about is that that seems to me to have the potential of causing more of an equal protection problem than it's actually solving. And the reason why I get to that possible conclusion is thinking about two applicants who would like to have their family backgrounds credited in this applications process, and I'm hoping to get your reaction to this hypothetical. The first applicant says: I'm from North Carolina. My family has been in this area for generations, since before the Civil War, and I would like you to know that I will be the fifth generation to graduate from the University of North Carolina. I now have that opportunity to do that, and given my family background, it's important to me that I get to attend this university. I want to honor my family's legacy by going to this school. The second applicant says, I'm from North Carolina, my family's been in this area for generations, since before the Civil War, but they were slaves and never had a chance to attend this venerable institution. As an African American, I now have that opportunity, and given my family -- family background, it's important to me to attend this university. I want to honor my family legacy by going to this school. Now, as I understand your no-race-conscious admissions rule, these two applicants would have a dramatically different opportunity to tell their family stories and to have them count. The first applicant would be able to have his family background considered and valued by the institution as part of its consideration of whether or not to admit him, while the second one wouldn't be able to because his story is in many ways bound up with his race and with the race of his ancestors. So I want to know, based on how your rule would likely play out in scenarios like that, why excluding consideration of race in a situation in which the person is not saying that his race is something that has impacted him in a negative way, he just wants to have it honored, just like the other person had their personal background family story honored, why is telling him no not an equal protection violation?","<speaker>Patrick Strawbridge</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Racial classifications are wrong.
