So that -- that is in many provisions of the code. And, essentially, this just matches it. You know, you can collect from either one. There are two sources of -- there are two pots that one can collect from, and, you know, this is reflective of that. Is it absolutely necessary? It's not for exactly the reason you say.

I was interested in the -- the way this is initiated is through an assessment, and I was interested in how you established an assessment to start this process. And you cite us in your brief on page 17 to Laing versus U.S., number -- Footnote Number 13, which has some issues with circularity because it says the assessment, essentially -- the assessment, essentially a bookkeeping notation, is made when the Secretary or its delegate establishes an account against a taxpayer on the tax rolls. And, in other words, that boils down to it is when -- there's an assessment when the Secretary says there is an assessment. So the -- what would limit what you can do after you establish an assessment and then begin a collection process?","<speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The statute in this case requires that notice and judicial review be given to persons identified in a third-party summons issued in aid of a liability investigation. But Congress made an express exception to those entitlements for summonses issued in aid of collection of an assessment made against a delinquent taxpayer. We would read that collection exception by its terms, and because the summonses here were issued in aid of collection of a $2 million assessment against Mr. Polselli, the collection exception applies in this case. Petitioners, however, would disturb the balance that Congress struck by inserting two artificial limitations into the statute, namely, a direct connection requirement that supposedly leads into a legal interest test. But nothing in the statutory text, context, or history even hints at those limitations, and those limitations lack any established legal meaning, so their boundaries are amorphous. Petitioners say their limitations are necessary to impose a check on the IRS's summons authority. But multiple other checks exist, including the prospect of a challenge by the recipient of the third-party summons. Ultimately, Petitioners' position is that the statute is an unqualified pro-privacy guarantee. But, in fact, like many statutes, this one is a compromise. While Congress prioritized privacy rights at the liability investigation phase, it prioritized prompt and efficient collection of taxes at the collection phase, and it did so because, when we're at the collection phase, that necessarily means that there's a delinquent taxpayer who's refusing to pay an assessed liability and likely deliberately evading collection.

But, if it's an innocent third party, why would you impose secrecy on them? Unless the taxpayer is handed over to a fiduciary or you have information that it is an alter ego or a partner or something else, why shouldn't an innocent taxpayer get notice?

But Congress made an express exception to those entitlements for summonses issued in aid of collection of an assessment made against a delinquent taxpayer. We would read that collection exception by its terms, and because the summonses here were issued in aid of collection of a $2 million assessment against Mr. Polselli, the collection exception applies in this case. Petitioners, however, would disturb the balance that Congress struck by inserting two artificial limitations into the statute, namely, a direct connection requirement that supposedly leads into a legal interest test.

And this Court has held in the Scripps-Howard case that Congress would not, without clearly expressing such a purpose, deprive the courts of their customary power to order stays under review. So what if we look beyond Section 16? Again, this Court has held under very similar circumstances in the Nken case that when Congress includes particular language in one section but excludes it from another section of the same Act, that Congress acts intentionally and purposely with respect to the disparate inclusion and exclusion. And, here, in this case, we have two examples of this inclusion/exclusion dichotomy. First, we have Section 3 of the FAA itself, which includes a mandatory stay, and then we have Section 1292(d)(4)(B), which was part of the same Act as Section 16. Under basic rules of statutory construction then, Section 16 cannot be said to harbor a hidden automatic stay provision. And, as a practical matter, this means that the courts retain their equitable power to use their discretion to issue stays when appropriate, a power that has been vested in this Court since the founding of the republic. And that is as it should be because stays are an important power and are important when appropriate. But whether they are appropriate depends. With respect to Section 16 appeals, it depends on the type of discovery allowed for under the arbitration clause. It depends on the strength of the arbitrability appeal. It depends on the weighing of the equities. And it depends on the -- on the public interest at stake in the underlying litigation. Let me just finish by saying there is no such thing as a Griggs divestiture rule. That is made up by my friend on the other side.

Stewart</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me just make a couple of points first before taking questions. Mr. Garre said that going back to Marbury versus Madison, courts have been authorized to grant injunctive relief against unconstitutional governmental action. And it's certainly true that there's a longstanding practice of courts, without explicit statutory authority, granting equitable relief to claimants who would otherwise have no access to judicial review of constitutional claims. But that authority has never been unlimited. It's always been constrained by doctrines about what can you sue about and when can you sue. On pages 47 to 50 of our brief, we cite a series of cases of this Court that stand for the proposition that courts will not intervene in pending agency proceedings until the proceedings culminate in an order or a rule that sets legal obligations, imposes a sanction, et cetera. One of those is Myers versus Bethlehem Shipbuilding. In that case, the shipbuilding company was in NLRB proceedings and said my operations don't have a sufficient connection to interstate or foreign commerce to make me regulable under the National Labor Relations Act. And the Court held that's the kind of claim that has to wait until the end of the administrative proceedings, even though you are asserting a constitutional objection to the exercise of authority over you. Another case is Federal Power Commission versus Metropolitan Edison that we cited. If you look at the relevant page of Metropolitan Edison, you'll see literally a page of string cites to earlier cases decided before 1938 that established this principle. Courts don't intervene in pending agency proceedings dating all the way back to a 1912 opinion written by Chief Justice Edward White. And so, to us, the most difficult aspect of this came -- of this case is whether the barrier to suit should be viewed as jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional. But the most salient fact is this has never been the kind of thing a person could get immediate review of in court. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2022,coherent,"{

Kavanaugh,"Mr. Stewart, in thinking about the precedents, I think there are good arguments both ways, as I've indicated in my questions, but then I think there's a broader question that Justice Alito raised earlier that I want to follow up on, which is, what makes the most sense? What makes the most sense for the government? What makes the most sense for the citizens? What makes the most sense for the court system? And I think cutting against your position on that question is you can get more certainty, more clarity quicker about a basic fundamental question about the constitutionality of the agency itself or the agency's structure itself. Now one thing that I would be concerned about that supports you is floodgates, delay, obstruction. But, you know, unless you get -- unless the plaintiffs challenging the procedures get a preliminary injunction, the agency procedures are just going to continue on, and to get a preliminary injunction, they would have to, you know, show likelihood of success. So that would deter, I would think, frivolous claims or claims that are not meritorious.

But that authority has never been unlimited. It's always been constrained by doctrines about what can you sue about and when can you sue.

In that case, the shipbuilding company was in NLRB proceedings and said my operations don't have a sufficient connection to interstate or foreign commerce to make me regulable under the National Labor Relations Act.

So it's a -- it -- it -- it is an exception to the ordinary meaning of clear statutory language, final decision. Here, you have your APA argument. I understand.

So both of them took issue with the proposition that legislatures would exercise their authority without the constitutional checks that a state court provides. And then, in Rucho, three years ago, the Court assured everybody in a case very much like this one, it was a case about gerrymandering, and it says complaints about districting need not echo into a void because provisions in state statutes and state constitutions can provide standards and guidance for state courts to apply in addressing gerrymandering.

What if what is at issue is not any particular exercise of the state's legislature -- legislative authority, such as its -- its ability to make time, place, and manner determinations, but whether the entity that is purporting to exercise that power qualifies as this particular state's legislature? So you can imagine that we have two different state entities who claim to be the legislature for the purpose of the Elections Clause, and both of them start acting as such. They set election dates.

So, if that's true, if it is the state's constitution that tells us who the legislature is and whether what they're doing is a valid exercise of legislative authority, then I guess what I don't understand is why constitutional limits on the exercise of that entity on its power don't still apply, even in this context. So, in other words, the Elections Clause says you get the right to make this decision, that you have that policy determination. But the state constitution is the thing that gives this particular entity its authority to make any determinations and the state constitution says things like, when you make a determination about things in your policymaking role, in the legislative power that we're giving you, you have to make sure that, you know, people are treated equally. You have to -- whatever the constitutional provisions are that we say -- that you're saying are so vague or whatnot, are limitations on that entity's legislative authority not just in this area but in every area whenever they undertake to make a law. And so I guess what I'm trying to understand is why are you suggesting that in the context of the Elections Clause, when this entity would ordinarily be bound by all of the limitations in the state constitution in its legislative authority role, why suddenly in this context do you say, no, no, no, all those other constitutional provisions that would bind or constrict legislative authority that the state gives you because you're the state legislature, right, why -- why do those evaporate in this world? I read it as though the state court is essentially saying our constitution authorizes you to be the legislature only insofar as you act in accordance with our constitution's tenets, and you haven't done that in this instance.

13628,2022.21-1271-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"Yeah. Just to follow up on what Justice Barrett just said, I -- I'm wondering whether the answer about why a state constitution is different in this context is because the state constitution is the font of authority for all the relevant parties in terms of this dispute. The state constitution is what tells the state legislature what it cannot -- can and cannot do, what the state court can and cannot do. And I understand we have the -- the peculiar circumstance of the state supreme court being the one to interpret the state constitution, but it is different in terms of its legal consequence and stature than a statute. Am I wrong in thinking about it that way?","<speaker>Neal Kumar Katyal</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For 233 years, states have not read the Elections Clause the way you just heard. There are two reasons to affirm. One is that when enacting legislation, there's no such thing as an independent state legislature. The other is that North Carolina statutes authorized what the North Carolina court did. I'll focus on the first. Petitioners' idea that state legislatures created by state constitutions are independent of them is wrong. It is rejected by the Articles of Confederation, rejected by the early state constitutions, rejected by the founding practice, especially New York, where judges vetoed federal election bills. It's also rejected by this Court in cases such as Smiley and Hildebrant. Just three years ago in Rucho, this Court promised state constitutions can provide standards for state courts to apply and singled out for approval a Florida court decision that used a state constitution to invalidate a federal map. To accept Petitioners' claim, you'd have to ignore the text, history, and structure of our federal Constitution as well as nearly every state constitution today. Petitioners say for two centuries nearly everyone has been reading the clause wrong. That's a lot of wrong and a lot of wrong past elections.

13980,2022.21-1168-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett,"So your argument about the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment depends on a lot of statutes that you cite from the time. And let's just say that I might not read all those statutes the same way that you do, and one batch that I have some trouble with are the ones that have to do with service of process. I don't think those necessarily represent consent to general jurisdiction because having an agent who can accept process in a state could be, say, for a specific jurisdiction, putting aside whether or not -- you know, and the government says not -- the ideas of specific and general jurisdiction, you know -- I mean, sorry, the government says that yes, those ideas of specific and general jurisdiction, unlike your position, did obtain at the time. Why do you think that we should accept your argument that these service of -- service of process statutes are like consent to general jurisdiction?","<speaker>Ashley C. Keller</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As far back as 1827, states enacted laws like Pennsylvania's, and by 1868 or shortly thereafter, every state in the union had at least one and often several consent-by-registration statutes. This Court unanimously confirmed that such statutes comport with due process over a century ago in reasoning that's been embraced by jurists from Holmes to Cardozo to Hand to Frankfurter. With history, tradition, and precedent on Mr. Mallory's side, how can my friend challenge Pennsylvania law under the original meaning of due process? By claiming that these statutes were really just about specific jurisdiction based on contacts. Never mind that specific jurisdiction wasn't a thing in 1868 and for decades after the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. Anachronistically, importing the principles of International Shoe into the ratification generation is my friend's maneuver, exactly what Justice Scalia counseled against in Burnham. That approach is not originalism. It's paying lip service to originalism, treating the doctrine as an infinitely malleable pretext to reach a policy outcome that Norfolk Southern and other big businesses prefer. But originalism is not a pretext. It's a neutral doctrine that aims to faithfully apply our nation's Constitution regardless of who benefits. Fidelity to the original public meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment in this case means that the flesh-and-blood little guy wins and the Fortune 500 company loses.

I mean, what Fry said was, look, if you're not objecting to the denial of a FAPE at all, then you're obviously outside the sphere of the exhaustion requirement. And then it said: And then there's another question, which is, if you're seeking relief for that denial of a FAPE that's not available under the IDEA, i.e., if you're seeking compensatory damages, which everybody understood not to be available under the IDEA. And that's the question that Fry says nothing about. Is that correct?","<speaker>Roman Martinez</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For 12 years, Sturgis neglected Miguel, denied him an education, and lied to his parents about the progress he was allegedly making in school. This shameful conduct permanently stunted Miguel's ability to communicate with the outside world. It also violated two federal statutes, the IDEA and the ADA, giving different remedies to victims of discrimination. Miguel responded by doing everything the IDEA wants him to do. He filed an IDEA agency claim. He followed the IDEA settlement procedures. And he accepted a favorable settlement giving him full IDEA relief, including an immediate FAPE. Sturgis wants you to hold that this settlement extinguishes Miguel's separate and distinct rights to money damages under the ADA. You should reject that. I want to emphasize three points. First, the text only requires exhaustion if a non-IDEA claim seeks relief that's actually available under the IDEA. Exhaustion isn't required in cases like this one seeking only money damages, a remedy the IDEA does not authorize. Second, Miguel's settlement fully exhausted the IDEA procedures. Further exhaustion is unnecessary and it's futile because it would be pointless. Miguel has already received everything he's entitled to under the IDEA statute. And, third, the net effect of Sturgis's arguments here is to defy the IDEA's clear purpose. That purpose is twofold: one, getting kids a FAPE as quickly as possible, and, two, preserving their legal rights under other statutes and the Constitution. Sturgis puts these goals on a collision course with each other. In any given case, its rule will either disincentivize settlements and block immediate FAPE relief, or it will nullify rights under other statutes. That makes no sense.

Any argument that the Act extends -- departs from that longstanding principle would have to be based on especially compelling evidence. But, here, Hetronic International offers only the text definition of commerce, and this Court has repeatedly rejected the notion that commerce language is enough to extend the law to foreign conduct, even if that language otherwise invokes the full scope of the constitutional commerce power. International also invokes this Court's decision in Steele. But Steele, by its terms, addressed only the Act's application to U.S. citizens acting abroad. There is no reason to discard that self-imposed limit and extend Steele to reach foreign defendants like Petitioners. To the contrary, extending the Lanham Act's reach into foreign countries would create the very risk of international friction that this Court's current extraterritoriality doctrine seeks to avoid. That leads to the suggestion that imposing liability for foreign sales to foreign buyers by foreign companies somehow qualifies as a domestic application of the Act.

I just have a question on -- on the major questions doctrine, and I wanted just a little bit of background for why -- I want to get your views on how it applies. You're -- you're arguing here that no notice-and-comment proceeding was required before the action taken on the half trillion dollars of loans and that because of your view that the President can act unilaterally, that there was no role for Congress to play in this either, and at least in this case, given your view of standing, there's no role for us to play in this -- in this either. Now we take very seriously the idea of the separation of powers and that power should be divided to prevent its abuse, and there are many procedural niceties that have to be followed for the same purpose. The case reminds me of the one we had a few years ago under a different administration where the administration tried acting on its own to cancel the Dreamers program, and we blocked that effort. And I just wonder, given the posture of the case and given our historic concern about the separation of powers, you would recognize at least that this is a case that presents extraordinarily serious, important issues about the role of Congress and about the role that we should exercise in scrutinizing that, significant enough that the major questions doctrine ought to be considered implicated?","<speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: COVID-19 is the most devastating pandemic in our nation's history and it has caused enormous disruption and economic distress. Over the past three years, millions of Americans have struggled to pay rent, utilities, food, and many have been unable to pay their debts. To head off immediate harm for student-loan borrowers, two Secretaries across two administrations invoked the HEROES Act to suspend interest and payment obligations for all Americans with federally held loans. But, if that forbearance ends without further relief, it's undisputed that defaults and delinquencies will surge above pre-pandemic levels. So Secretary Cardona again invoked the HEROES Act to provide a measure of loan forgiveness to ensure that this unprecedented pandemic does not leave borrowers worse off in relation to their student loans. The states ask this Court to deny that vital relief to millions of Americans, but they lack standing to seek that result. They principally assert harm to a separate legal person, MOHELA, that could sue in its own name but has chosen not to do so, and the states' asserted harms to their tax revenues are self-inflicted and indirect.

On standing, Missouri has the right to vindicate the harms to MOHELA. MOHELA is a state-created and state-controlled public instrumentality that performs the essential public function of providing financial aid to Missouri students. The Secretary's program threatens to cut MOHELA's operating revenue by 40 percent. That will directly undermine MOHELA's ability to further its critical public purposes, and the state has standing to assert those harms. On the merits, this is a major questions case. A nearly half trillion dollar debt cancellation program is undoubtedly a matter of vast economic and political significance. It is also unprecedented. Never before has the HEROES Act been used to forgive a single loan. In addition, the Secretary here asserts a breathtaking power, to do anything that he thinks might reduce the risk of borrowers defaulting, even years after a national emergency arises. He needs clear congressional authorization for such power, but he doesn't have it here because the HEROES Act does not authorize this program. The Act permits the Secretary to waive or modify existing provisions because of a national emergency. It does not permit him to rewrite existing provisions to create a new program that covers 95 percent of borrowers and applies to them regardless of how the pandemic affected them. This Court should declare this program unlawful, and I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2022,coherent,"{

17976,2022.22-506-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"Okay. Let me just ask you one final question on my big-picture concern. So I was listening carefully to your opening statement, and you started by indicating that this is one of today's most debated policy questions, and you ended by saying that we, the courts, should essentially answer it by invalidating this program. And what concerns me is that to the extent you're talking about separation of powers and major questions, the judiciary is part of the same constitutional separation of powers dynamic that compels us to think about questions like the major questions doctrine. And I feel like we really do have to be concerned about jumping into the political fray, unless we are prompted to do so by a lawsuit that is brought by someone who has an actual interest. So this is why I'm sort of pressing really hard on the standing point. And so do -- do you dispute that the ordinary standing rule would be that a plaintiff cannot establish standing by asserting the interests of an independent actor or by saying that an independent actor not before the Court will respond to the defendant's actions in a certain way? I mean, isn't the ordinary rule one that really doesn't cover you and what you're asking for in a way is an extension of our standing principles to allow for the state to proceed with this action?","<speaker>James A.

It's not really a hypothetical, because I happen to have two clerks in my chambers this year who are engaged, so, in looking at this case and preparing this case, I looked at their websites. And so the hypothetical is about, like, I'm going to call it the standard website. They both have their names on it, the date of the wedding, a picture of the couple. Then there are a bunch of places that you can click to, and one is the schedule of events and the other is travel and hotel arrangements, and another is favorite things to do in town while you're here, and another is registry. So that's what most websites look like, yeah? And they're not particularly ideological and they're not particularly religious. They're not particularly anything, all right? And -- and then there's a tag line just like the tag line in this case about sort of who created the website or whose graphics and design and typefaces and so forth were used in the website. And so one of them says -- I'm going to substitute a woman's name just to not advertise -- but one of them says, Made By Love With Amber by -- Made With Love By Amber, right?

Because I also heard you suggest earlier that there's something different about race, maybe the person wouldn't sell to someone of a different race. So -- so suppose -- you say that photography is expressive. Can you give me your thoughts on a photography business in a shopping mall during the holiday season that offers a product called Scenes with Santa, and this business wants to express its own view of nostalgia about Christmases past by reproducing classic 1940s and 1950s Santa scenes. They do it in sepia tone and they are customizing each one. This is not off a rack. They're really bringing the people in and having them interact with Santa, children, because they're trying to capture the feelings of a certain era. But precisely because they're trying to capture -- capture the feelings of a certain era, their policy is that only white children can be photographed with Santa in this way because that's how they view the scenes with Santa that they're trying to depict. Now the business will gladly refer families of color to the Santa at the other end of the mall who will take anybody, but -- and -- and they will photograph families of color in other scenes -- other scenes, so they're not discriminating against the families. What they're saying is Scenes with Santa is preserved for white families and they want to have a sign next to the Santa that says ""only white children.""

They're not purporting to be a business for hire in -- in -- in any meaningful sense.

There's an explicit message in the actual work, but to the extent that actual work is identical to the -- to the work that she would otherwise sell to the gay couple except for their names, then she is implicitly saying, you know, by selling this, I'm going to be violating my own beliefs.

So I call these products Grandma Helen's Protestant Provisions.

What if it says Jack Daniel's? That's an easier hypothetical. The -- the Chewy dog toy says Jack Daniel's and it's --","<speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves a dog toy that copies Jack Daniel's trademark and trade dress and associates its whiskey with dog poop. After a four-day trial, the district court found both infringement and dilution. The Ninth Circuit erroneously reversed both holdings. As to infringement, the Ninth Circuit did not disturb the trial court's finding of likelihood of confusion. It instead reversed by applying an exception to the Lanham Act that the Second Circuit in Rogers versus Grimaldi invented for movie titles. Under Rogers, an expressive work is allowed to confuse as long as the use of a mark is artistically relevant and not explicitly misleading. But the Lanham Act has no exceptions for expressive works. It bars using marks for any goods when likely to cause confusion as to origin, sponsorship, or approval. Artistic relevance has nothing to do with confusion, and both implicit and explicit uses can confuse. Nor does constitutional avoidance justify Rogers. Rogers doesn't plausibly construe any text, and there are no First Amendment issues to avoid. Trademarks are ancient property rights that necessarily restrict speech to protect investment in goodwill and prevent consumer confusion, and parodies can be confusing. Now, as a practical matter, parodies won't confuse when differences in marks, markets, or message, typically ridicule, signal that the brand company didn't make the joke. But absent these features, pervasive copying and trading off a brand's goodwill tends to confuse. And survey results showing consumer confusion indicate that the parodist did too much copying and not enough distinguishing. As to dilution, the Ninth Circuit held that the exclusions for noncommercial use mean noncommercial speech. That holding renders neighboring exclusions superfluous, and it nullifies Congress's decision to limit the parody exclusion to uses other than as a designation of source. This Court should give noncommercial use its ordinary meaning, a use not involving the buying and selling of goods. I welcome your questions.</text>",2022,coherent,"{

By using a hypothetical with a dog toy that is nearly identical to a Jack Daniel's bottle, the questioner is attempting to gauge whether Blatt's argument would still hold in a situation where the copying is more overt and blatant.""
