Rather, the General Assembly largely preserved District 1 from the constitutional benchmark plan and made changes based on traditional criteria and politics. The panel acknowledged that the General Assembly pursued a political goal of increasing District 1's Republican vote share. It achieved that goal by moving Republicans into the district and Democrats out of the district. All of the direct evidence confirms that it used political data, not racial data, to identify Republicans and Democrats. The panel declared District 1 a racial gerrymander only by departing from this Court's precedents and adopting sua sponte an erroneous racial target theory. First, the panel failed to enforce the alternative map requirement. In a circumstantial case like this, only such an alternative can disentangle race and politics. Second, the panel's racial target theory hyper-entangled race and politics and simply makes no sense. The panel believed the General Assembly needed a racial target in Charleston County to achieve its political goal district-wide.

So this is what I'm a little concerned about because, to the extent that this distinction's turning on whether or not there is direct evidence, I wonder if it is reasonable to require such evidence or -- or say that such evidence would exist in a situation that is not a majority/majority -- a majority/minority district scenario. You can see how there would be direct evidence when the state's goal is to try to, in its view, comply with the VRA, they're trying to make a majority/minority district, so we're going to have some evidence of people saying that. But, in a situation like this, where that is not the case, where the state is saying instead, we are trying to, you know, achieve a partisan tilt, I guess I don't understand -- and, excuse me, we've also said that its, you know, intent to use race is a very hard thing to prove just on its own.

So you discount all four of the plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Ragusa, but there were three others. Two of the experts accounted for partisanship but not geography, and two others accounted for geography but not partisanship. There's no rule that requires one expert to do all of it. And even with Dr. Ragusa, his purpose for his choices were not your purposes. His purposes for his choices were to show that VTDs with a particular percentage of Blacks were going to be selected over white districts, and that proof he made.

357,2023.22-807-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"Okay. And -- and with respect to this question about maps and alternative map, I'm just wondering whether or not an alternative map is helpful with respect to the contention that the district was being oddly manufactured with respect to who was being moved in or out. This is similar to the question that I asked plaintiffs' counsel. My understanding is that politics is driving it at a sort of meta level, and the map-maker identifies a Republican-leaning district that he would like to include. That Republican-leaning district has both white and Black voters in it. And so one would assume that just by that move, the BVAP goes up. I don't know if that's right, but I'm just -- I'm walk -- I'm walking it through. But, in this situation, the BVAP stays the same at the end of the day and we have evidence that the map-maker went into the rest of the district and moved out a certain number of Democratic-leaning voters who happened to be Black or plaintiffs say because they were Black, but that's what makes the BVAP remain the same. It's that we've now moved out Black Democrats to account for, I guess, the Republican-leaning district that we have included. Is the use of race in that way, you know, I have now got a higher BVAP than I want, and I'm moving out Black voters, not white Democrats, Black Democrats, in order to bring the BVAP down, is that a violation in -- in this world?","<speaker>John M.

So Florida's law so far as I can understand it is very broad, and we're talking  about the classic social media platforms, but it looks to me like it could cover Uber, it looks to me like it could cover just Google search engines, Amazon web service, and all of those things would look very different. And, you know, Justice Sotomayor brought up Etsy. It seems to me that they're arguing  -- now Etsy has a feed recommended for you, right, but it also just has shops for handmade goods that you can get. It looks a lot more like a brick-and-mortar marketplace or flea market, you know, than, you know, a place for hosting speech. Okay?  So, if this is a facial challenge and Florida's law indeed is broad enough to cover a lot of this conduct which is farther away from expression than these standard social media platforms, why didn't you then in your brief  kind of defend it by pointing out, look, there's all this other stuff that's perfectly fine that Florida covers.

When I came in, I had  the reaction Justice Alito did, which is we should vacate and remand. And I have been thinking about what does that do to the preliminary injunction, because I agree with you, as  I understand what the State did below, was to say we don't have to offer you any justification for any part of our law because everybody of these social media companies are common  carriers. And I think what's clear is  --from our questioning -- that that's not true, that there are many functions that are expressive that we can't say are common carriers. But, even if we did say they were like common carriers, the issue would be one of what's the level of scrutiny. And the State said there's no level of scrutiny we're going to address. They basically said we can do anything we want to common carriers and to any of the expressive platforming or deplatforming things. But I don't even think that's true. They can't come in and -- and I'm not sure they can  --do any of these things or some of these things even to common carriers if it is a sort of content or viewpoint content exclusion. So a common carrier doesn't have to permit unruly behavior. It doesn't have to permit -- it can throw somebody off the train if they are threatening somebody else or if they're doing other things.

4991,2023.22-859-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"I don't understand why the forum is the first question. I thought that the first question was, what is the nature of the claim? In other words, is this a common law action? The concern that you mentioned many times was is the law of fraud being federalized. And when the law of fraud is being federalized, the Seventh Amendment is implicated because what the Seventh Amendment is doing is protecting the right of a person who has a common law fraud claim to bring it in federal court and not have it directed into some forum where they don't get a jury trial. So it seems to me that the initial question is, what is the right or the duty or whatever that is being established? And so Atlas Roofing begins by acknowledging that the Act created a new statutory duty, right? So, when we have this new statutory duty, it's not a common law duty, the question is, can this new duty be directed to an administrative tribunal without Seventh Amendment protections or not? And Atlas Roofing says of course because it's a new duty. It's not -- we're not worried that they are stealing the common law claims and putting it into this situation. So, for me, the answer is not starting with, where is this taking place? It's starting with, what is the claim or the duty at issue? And if it's a new statutory duty, says Atlas Roofing, we've held forever that Congress can assign it to the court, Congress can assign it to the administrative agency.

I mean, the case begins, sentence one, the issue in this case -- in -- in these cases is whether, consistent with the Seventh Amendment, Congress may create a new cause of action in the government for civil penalties enforceable in an administrative agency where there is no jury trial. You seem to say, well, it depends on whether Congress has assigned resolution of this to the agency. But that seems totally conclusory and circular to me. And I think the question is, when does the Seventh Amendment prohibit Congress from assigning it to the agency as opposed to giving it to an Article III court? You say that's forum-dependent, but -- but the -- the question is, when can they give it to one forum versus the other? And in my view, the Seventh Amendment and what Atlas Roofing is saying is that it's -- it's claim-dependent. It's the part of your argument where you talk about is this a situation in which Congress is taking a common law duty, right, action, or whatever and moving it into the administrative process? And so the Seventh Amendment says you can't do that. If a person has a common law right of fraud, right, the common law creates duties like the duty not to make a representation that people rely on to their detriment. And it's established a right of action in private parties to enforce that duty. They can come to court. And the Seventh Circuit -- the Seventh Amendment says, when you have such a right to enforce that duty, you are -- by the Constitution, you have -- you -- you have the ability to come to court. The government can't make you go to some administrative tribunal and have no jury. All right? But there are also other duties in the world. Those duties can be created by statute, right? They're not common law duties. And when you have a new duty -- Atlas Roofing many, many times talks about this being a new statutory duty that has been created.

5042,2023.22-859-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"Exactly, Mr. McColloch. And so I'm asking, why isn't the reason that the private/private cases are hard because the Court is concerned that what might be happening is Congress is shifting things that were traditionally common law claims adjudicated between private people into this administrative process and not people -- giving people trials by juries? Like, what makes it hard is when a statutory scheme looks like it could be displacing the normal common law private-to- private enforcement of a fraud claim. But I think what Justice Kagan is saying is that the reason why these cases, the ones in which the statute is giving the enforcement authority to the government for the benefit of the public, are not hard and why people haven't continued to bring these is because it doesn't look anything like the common law scenario where we've had two private parties fighting over fraud and they brought it to court. Instead, Congress has created a new thing to supplement that private scenario or maybe it's brand new in any event, but it doesn't -- it's not a common-law-rooted kind of thing that is being brought in court -- I mean, sorry, brought in the administrative agency with all the concerns that many of my colleagues have raised.","<speaker>S.

As this Court has recognized time and again, the touchstone of the remedial inquiry is congressional intent.

6866,2023.22-1238-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"Ms. Hansford, I -- I'm troubled by one piece of this case, okay? I do agree McKesson and Harper say, if you have a pre-deprivation mechanism to protect yourself, the government can level up or down because you should have taken advantage of your ability to protect yourself. Putting aside Respondents' argument that if they didn't pay the fee here, they would have been thrown out of court -- and I agree that there's examples of people who didn't pay the fee. They put the money in escrow, or some actually withheld it and didn't get thrown out. So there -- assuming there's a pre-deprivation remedy, which I do, okay, and I think McKesson would control, there's a part of your argument that troubles me, and it's with the people who invoked the remedy, meaning I under -- in normal course of litigation, if you think you shouldn't pay something, don't pay it. Go to court and don't pay it. And some people did that.

You've made very ably the argument for why it's impossible to do it retrospectively leveling up. And Justice Kagan points to the argument about why it's impossible to do it retrospectively leveling down because it's inconsistent with the entirety of the bankruptcy scheme as Congress has laid it forward. So I guess I'm just trying to understand why we couldn't rely on something like Morales-Santana and the fact that it -- if it's hard to do or impossible to do, then we can just go prospective.","<speaker>Daniel L.

It cannot simply keep the unconstitutional fees and promise not to do it again. The government is also wrong that Respondents somehow forfeited their rights by failing to invoke a pre-deprivation remedy. Under settled law, due process requires retrospective relief unless an exclusive pre-deprivation remedy is both clear and certain.

It is neither legally nor practically feasible, and there is zero indication Congress would endorse a severe retroactive imposition, just as Congress refused to apply the 2020 Act retroactively.

McNamara</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Question Presented in this case is resolved by the text of the Fifth Amendment, which, unlike any other provision of the Constitution, imposes on the government a  --an explicit duty to pay money. It's also answered by this Court's decision in First English, which holds that the just compensation remedy is mandatory and that the Fifth Amendment itself furnishes a basis on which a court can award just compensation in an inverse condemnation case. And this right of property owners to sue in inverse condemnation to obtain just compensation for an alleged taking is at the heart of modern American takings law. It's at the heart of inverse condemnation claims filed against state and local governments nationwide. And it's also at the heart of every takings claim filed against the federal government under the Tucker Act. The Tucker Act provides no cause of action, no substantive entitlement to a remedy. The cause of action, the substantive entitlement to a remedy, in every Tucker Act takings case is the self- executing Fifth Amendment, the same cause of action recognized in First English, the same cause of action pled here. To reject that cause of action now is to upend the way lower courts, both state and federal, understand the Takings Clause to work and also to abandon this Court's consistent explanations of that clause not just in First English but in more recent cases like Knick v. Township of Scott. And there's no reason to make that kind of drastic change. This Court has already recognized that money- mandating legal obligations logically come along with the right to file a lawsuit to enforce those obligations. That's true as to statutes, which is what this Court held in Maine Community Health Options. It should be at least as true as to  the Constitution, and this Court's precedents consistently teach that it is. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2023,coherent,"{

8085,2023.22-451-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas, How do you  --how do we discern statu tory --delegation from statutory silence?,"<speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Throughout this litigation and at times this morning, Petitioners have sought to characterize this case as presenting  a fundamental question of the separation of powers and a test of Article III:  Will courts continue  to say what the law is?  But I think, stepping back, I want to make sure that what doesn't get lost in the shuffle is that Petitioners have made an important concession that I think illustrates  that the issue here is actually far narrower and that their attacks on Chevron lack merit and are unnecessary. The concession is this:  Petitioners acknowledge that Congress can expressly delegate to agencies the authority to define statutory terms and fill gaps. Imagine, for example, if the statute said, in Chevron, ""stationary source"" as defined by the Administrator. I take both Petitioners to give that up and recognize that is a delegation and courts should respect that. The role of the court in that circumstance is to make sure that the agency has followed the proper procedures and stayed what -- within whatever outer bounds Congress itself has set. And all of that complies with the Constitution, of course, because Congress has  Article I authority to delegate gap-filling authority to agencies, and the executive has core Article II authority to fill in those gaps. That's a core exercise of the executive power. And then the Article III courts are just fulfilling their judicial role when they give effect to what Congress has done in its choice to rely on the agency in that regard. But I think what all of this shows is that the constitutional attacks on Chev ron and the suggestion that it's egregiously wrong in that regard lack merit because there is no constitutional distinction between that kind of express delegation and the delegations recognized in Chevron. If Congress can expressly vest an agency with authority to interpret the law through an express delegation, then it can do the same thing implicitly, especially in a world where Congress has to provide the agency with the express authority to carry the statute into operation with the force and effect of law. Now we can debate, of course, whether Chevron drew the right line in identifying exactly when these delegations have occurred. I think the Court got that right for all of the reasons I tried to explain this morning. But I  think it's important to recognize that that debate doesn't have a constitutional dimension to it that falls out of the equation. Instead, it's just a question of whether the Court drew the right line in identifying when a delegation has occurred. And if you recognize that, then I think what's left over are the practical concerns that have been raised about Chevron. And I don't want to diminish the force of the concerns that some members of the Court have articulated, but I also think that those concerns are manageable. The Court could do in this case what it did in Kisor. It could clarify and articulate the limits of Chevron deference without taking the drastic step of upending decades of settled precedent.

Prelogar</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Throughout this litigation and at times this morning, Petitioners have sought to characterize this case as presenting  a fundamental question of the separation of powers and a test of Article III:  Will courts continue  to say what the law is?  But I think, stepping back, I want to make sure that what doesn't get lost in the shuffle is that Petitioners have made an important concession that I think illustrates  that the issue here is actually far narrower and that their attacks on Chevron lack merit and are unnecessary. The concession is this:  Petitioners acknowledge that Congress can expressly delegate to agencies the authority to define statutory terms and fill gaps. Imagine, for example, if the statute said, in Chevron, ""stationary source"" as defined by the Administrator. I take both Petitioners to give that up and recognize that is a delegation and courts should respect that. The role of the court in that circumstance is to make sure that the agency has followed the proper procedures and stayed what -- within whatever outer bounds Congress itself has set. And all of that complies with the Constitution, of course, because Congress has  Article I authority to delegate gap-filling authority to agencies, and the executive has core Article II authority to fill in those gaps. That's a core exercise of the executive power. And then the Article III courts are just fulfilling their judicial role when they give effect to what Congress has done in its choice to rely on the agency in that regard. But I think what all of this shows is that the constitutional attacks on Chev ron and the suggestion that it's egregiously wrong in that regard lack merit because there is no constitutional distinction between that kind of express delegation and the delegations recognized in Chevron. If Congress can expressly vest an agency with authority to interpret the law through an express delegation, then it can do the same thing implicitly, especially in a world where Congress has to provide the agency with the express authority to carry the statute into operation with the force and effect of law. Now we can debate, of course, whether Chevron drew the right line in identifying exactly when these delegations have occurred. I think the Court got that right for all of the reasons I tried to explain this morning.

But often the government seeks deference for adjudications between individual parties and then apply that to everybody without notice to them, or deference for interpretive rules for which no notice-and-comment, let alone formal rulemaking or adjudicatory proceedings, is required.

Accordingly, when a district court neglects to enter a preliminary order of forfeiture before sentencing, in violation of  Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B), the court may nonetheless proceed to order forfeiture at the sentencing itself as long as the court's violation was harmless.

Now our basic submission in this case is that a violation of Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) should be treated like any other garden-variety procedural error in the sentencing process. When a court commits a procedural error at sentencing, the normal thing to do is to apply Rule 52, which is the provision in the Federal Rules that codifies principles of harmless error and plain error. Under Rule 52(a), if an error does not affect the defendant's substantial rights, it must be disregarded as harmless. Petitioner tries to avoid the application of harmless error principles by characterizing this particular  requirement as a mandatory claim-processing rule. Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) is not such a rule for all the reasons that this Court identified in Dolan with respect to the analogous timing requirement in the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act. Let me just emphasize three of the considerations that the Court stressed in Dolan: text, context, and purpose. Textually, the rule here imposes an obligation on the court, not the litigants, and it does not specify any sanction for the court's violation. That text operates in the broader context of a statutory framework that  makes clear that criminal forfeiture is a mandatory consequence of conviction and that forfeiture is part of the sentence imposed for the offense. The purpose of requiring the entry of a preliminary order before sentencing is to ensure that the forfeiture that is actually imposed at the sentencing itself is accurate and complete. Accordingly, when a district court neglects to enter a preliminary order of forfeiture before sentencing, in violation of  Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B), the court may nonetheless proceed to order forfeiture at the sentencing itself as long as the court's violation was harmless.
