""Matter"" suggests a noun, and the closest antecedent noun is ""determination."" Yet -- and, in fact, if you read Section 6330(d)(3), it provides that the IRS appeals office shall retain jurisdiction with respect to any determination made under this section. So the statute by its own terms in another provision is making clear that jurisdiction is tied to determination, not petition.

It says what the taxpayer may do, and it says nothing about the Tax Court's jurisdiction.

Our reading is more natural. It stops at the closest reasonable antecedent, and it uses the word ""matter"" as it's ordinarily understood.

And, really, the Vietnam War is what made this statute necessary because it's the first time we see a state potentially taking action that's going to directly affect the military's power. But do you discount the 1830s history, where, as did Justice Gorsuch, with respect to the habeas power? And, there, courts were releasing federal military officers from state custody because they were needed for the war efforts at the time, and the courts and the states had absolutely no hesitation in saying that Congressional need superseded the states' need to -- to hold a prisoner in custody. That was an individual suit, not for money, I grant you, but you didn't need money there because all you needed was the person to be released. So I guess what I'm asking is you concede that the states knew that if they impeded the war effort they would be sued by the federal government at least. I know that the first opportunity an individual had to sue in the 1830s for his own release, the courts gave him that power, the individual, to sue the state in state court.

1626,2021.20-480-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch,"Counsel, as -- as I understand your -- your colleague on the other side, and I may not, but, as I understand it as best I can in this area, we -- we all understand that National Guardsmen serve in at least two capacities, and one of them is denominated by the government for purposes of its own HR administration as civilian. And -- and so, fine, he served as a civilian when he was working as a technician. That was -- that's how you classified it. But just looking at the language of the statute -- and I think this is the argument in its simplest terms as I understand it -- was -- were the payments based -- were they made wholly on service in the capacity of -- as -- as a member of the uniformed service, and the answer he would give is yes because, while you denominate it civilian for certain purposes, you also said it could only be performed by someone who is a member of a uniformed service. So the work may be civilian for a bunch of other purposes, but it can only be performed by someone who is serving in the capacity of a National Guardsman. What's wrong with that argument?","<speaker>Nicole F. Reaves</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a dual-status technician retires, he receives two separate streams of payments, and the application of the uniformed services exception depends on the basis for each set of payments that he receives. First, he receives Civil Service Retirement System payments from the Office of Personnel Management for the work that he performs in his full-time civilian role as a technician. Those payments do not trigger the uniformed services exception because they are based on his civilian employment. A technician also receives a second stream of payments which are military retirement payments from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for his part-time military service, that is, his inactive duty training and drills and his active duty service in the National Guard. Those military retirement payments do trigger the uniformed service exception because they are based wholly on service in a qualifying National Guard capacity. And Petitioner and other dual-status technicians like him, when they were in the role, received two separate paychecks with two separate leave and earnings statements. One was a paycheck for their 9-to-5 technician work, and the other was the paycheck for all their inactive and active duty service. Congress also repeatedly categorized technician service as outside -- as civilian service, not uniformed service. First, Congress did not include dual-status technicians within the definition of a member of a uniformed service that is cross-referenced in the uniformed services exception. Second, in Section 10216 of Title 10, one of the two primary provisions that governs dual-status technicians, Congress describes technicians as civilian four separate times. And, third, in Title 5, Congress defined technician employment as falling within the civilian service of the government and ensured that technicians would receive civilian retirement payments for their civilian employment. I think I'd start then by discussing a couple of points that my friend on the other side made, and the first is whether an individual knows what type of status they're in at any given point in time. And it's actually quite clear what status a technician is at any point. During his 9-to-5 job, a technician is doing work in the technician role, and in that role, he has a variety of benefits that he doesn't have while he's working in his National Guard role, and that includes the fact that he can join a union. He can file complaints with the EEOC and MSPB. He can receive compensatory time off and worker's compensation. And he's compensated under the federal GS system. That's different from his National Guard service which he performs on weekends or if he's called up to active duty. Now my friend on the other side has suggested that if you are -- were to accept the government's position in this case, inactive duty service, such as training and drills, wouldn't trigger the uniformed services exception. And that's wrong because of a specific provision that deems such service as federal for the purpose of federal funding. And that provision is 10 U.S.C. 12602(a), which provides that for the purposes of laws providing benefits for members of the Army National Guard of the United States, military training, duty, or other service performed by a member of the Army National Guard of the United States in his status as a member of the Army National Guard, for which he's entitled to pay from the United States, shall be considered military training, duty, or other service in the federal service. So let me unpack that a little bit. What that means is that when an individual is in his state status, which usually happens when he's doing inactive training and drills, because of this provision, he's paid by the federal government as a general matter, and that does, in fact, trigger the uniformed services exception because that payment is payment for qualifying service. Now dual-status technician service is different because Congress has categorized that service as outside the uniformed service and the payments for that service as civilian in nature.</text>",2021,coherent,"{

First, Congress did not include dual-status technicians within the definition of a member of a uniformed service that is cross-referenced in the uniformed services exception. Second, in Section 10216 of Title 10, one of the two primary provisions that governs dual-status technicians, Congress describes technicians as civilian four separate times.

I think I'd start then by discussing a couple of points that my friend on the other side made, and the first is whether an individual knows what type of status they're in at any given point in time. And it's actually quite clear what status a technician is at any point. During his 9-to-5 job, a technician is doing work in the technician role, and in that role, he has a variety of benefits that he doesn't have while he's working in his National Guard role, and that includes the fact that he can join a union. He can file complaints with the EEOC and MSPB. He can receive compensatory time off and worker's compensation. And he's compensated under the federal GS system. That's different from his National Guard service which he performs on weekends or if he's called up to active duty. Now my friend on the other side has suggested that if you are -- were to accept the government's position in this case, inactive duty service, such as training and drills, wouldn't trigger the uniformed services exception. And that's wrong because of a specific provision that deems such service as federal for the purpose of federal funding. And that provision is 10 U.S.C. 12602(a), which provides that for the purposes of laws providing benefits for members of the Army National Guard of the United States, military training, duty, or other service performed by a member of the Army National Guard of the United States in his status as a member of the Army National Guard, for which he's entitled to pay from the United States, shall be considered military training, duty, or other service in the federal service. So let me unpack that a little bit. What that means is that when an individual is in his state status, which usually happens when he's doing inactive training and drills, because of this provision, he's paid by the federal government as a general matter, and that does, in fact, trigger the uniformed services exception because that payment is payment for qualifying service.

Section 415(a)(7)(A) is found at petition appendix page 69a, and it excludes from the windfall elimination provision ""a payment based wholly on service as a member of a uniformed service as defined in section 410(m)."" David Babcock, who served as a dual-status technician in the National Guard for 33 years, qualifies. Indeed, 32 U.S.C. 709 requires technicians like him to literally ""wear the uniform of the armed services, be a member of the National Guard, and hold the military grade specified by the Secretary."" And Babcock did. He wore the U.S. Army uniform day in, day out, teaching people how to fly Black Hawk helicopters and the like. Babcock engaged in service. He was a dual-status tech. He's undoubtedly a member of a uniformed service. Indeed, the Section 410(m) expressly says National Guard folks qualify. The government says Babcock was a civilian. Even if this were true, it would be irrelevant. The key statute, 415, doesn't use a civil-versus-military dividing line. It simply asks was the service uniformed. The government attempts to say that Babcock's service was not as wholly a member of the uniformed service. But the best reading of the statute, even before one gets to the veterans canon, rejects that. There is no status language in 415. The government would convert the word ""as"" into a status test trying to discern what hat someone was wearing at a given point in time. Congress certainly could have made such a choice, and, indeed, it has in many other statutes, but it did nothing like that here. So we have three basic arguments. One, the statute doesn't look to civilian status. It looks to uniformed service. Second, even if civilian status mattered, this would meet it. Dual-status tech service is irreducibly military.

2300,2021.21-309-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr.",What about ticket agents? Are they included as transport workers under your approach?,"<speaker>Jennifer D. Bennett</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If Congress wanted to exempt from the FAA just those workers aboard an instrumentality of commerce crossing state lines, it easily could have said so. Instead, it excluded the employment contracts of seamen, railroad employees, and any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce. This Court made clear in New Prime that we interpret this exemption just as we would any other statute, by the meaning of its words at the time it was passed. Those words exempt airline employees who load and unload cargo. Southwest can't dispute that by 1925 it was blackletter law that the transportation of goods in commerce begins when they're given to a carrier and it only ends when they're received at their final destination. Indeed, this Court had repeatedly held that loading and unloading cargo specifically is part of that transportation, not ancillary to transportation or connected to transportation, but it is itself transportation, that it is itself commerce. And just the year before the FAA was passed, as Justice Kavanaugh pointed out, this Court held that it was too plain to require discussion that a worker who unloaded a train was a railroad employee and that that railroad employee was engaged in interstate commerce.

This Court made clear in New Prime that we interpret this exemption just as we would any other statute, by the meaning of its words at the time it was passed. Those words exempt airline employees who load and unload cargo. Southwest can't dispute that by 1925 it was blackletter law that the transportation of goods in commerce begins when they're given to a carrier and it only ends when they're received at their final destination. Indeed, this Court had repeatedly held that loading and unloading cargo specifically is part of that transportation, not ancillary to transportation or connected to transportation, but it is itself transportation, that it is itself commerce. And just the year before the FAA was passed, as Justice Kavanaugh pointed out, this Court held that it was too plain to require discussion that a worker who unloaded a train was a railroad employee and that that railroad employee was engaged in interstate commerce. Yet Southwest contends that workers who load and unload airplanes are not part of any class of workers engaged in commerce for purposes of the FAA. There's no support for this contention in the text of the statute. Southwest can't point to even a single example from any time period in which the phrase ""engaged in foreign or interstate commerce"" has ever been given the meaning it proposes. So, instead, Southwest invokes the statute's purpose. The FAA favors arbitration, Southwest says, so the exemption must be given as narrow a reading as possible regardless of what the text actually means. But this Court rejected that very argument in New Prime. And even if we were to privilege purpose over text, on Southwest's interpretation, the exemption would do exactly what Circuit City held it was designed to avoid, unsettle developing and existing dispute resolution regimes at the time.

And then, second, we have to, I think, understand the regulation about changes in interpretation of law or changes in law to encompass judicial interpretations. And what do we do with Professor Mascott's amicus brief, for example, in which he quite rightly points out that we don't normally think of judicial interpretations as changes in the law?

2946,2021.21-234-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor,"Please let me finish my question, okay? This is one of them. We know that Congress writes statutes giving exemptions that it doesn't give in other areas because it does favor veterans. And whether you believe the veterans canon applies or not, the one thing it can -- one can say is you read it the way Congress wrote it, and if it wrote it in favor of veterans, you don't look for reasons to exempt veterans from the coverage it gives. So going back to Justice Thomas's question, I've read all the cases that you've given me, whether it's Berger, Wagner, Love. I do know that Love is a little bit unclear, but it favors Petitioner's side more than it favors yours. The veterans court there said there were two CUEs. It ended up deciding that the second CUE was more the ground for its decision, but it read it contrary to what you're saying it said. None of those other cases you've cited dealt with a situation identical to this one. They dealt with situations in which there were changes in law or changes in permissible regulatory interpretation. The only thing that favors you is what Justice Kavanaugh pointed to, which was that veteran -- the counsel's decision, but there is no evidence that Congress knew that when it -- when it adopted this CUE standard. And that veterans' counsel's decision admits that there are some disputes about what this means. And so I don't take it as much. It's telling us what it thinks it means, but I'm not sure that tells me what Congress thought it meant because it never referenced it. Having said all of that, I don't understand how you can claim that clear and unmistakable error in the decision made, in the statute, in the interpretation of the statute, even if it was compelled by the regulation at the time, it's disjunctive, error in the statute or error in the regulation.

And apart from this new theory's eleventh-hour appearance, there are two major problems. First, it finds no support in the record. The Joint Appendix is crystal-clear that the reason why the trial court admitted Morris's allocution was because Mr. Hemphill claimed Mr. Morris was the shooter. He advanced a third-party defense. And the state again and again asked to introduce Mr. Morris's allocution to refute that defense. And I'll turn the Court to Joint Appendix page 185, which is where, at the top of that page, the trial court summarizes its ruling. It says the defense's argument is in -- ""in all respects is appropriate and, under the circumstances of this case, probably a necessary argument to make."" But then the trial court says, ""Nonetheless, that argument opens the door to evidence offered by the state refuting the claim that Morris was, in fact, the shooter.""

But just in terms of drawing a line between this and a rule of completeness argument, if we were concerned of not doing that, how would you go about writing that?","<speaker>Jeffrey L. Fisher</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A defendant cannot lose his right under the Confrontation Clause to exclude testimonial hearsay simply by making a legitimate defense based on admissible evidence, and that is true even if the hearsay the prosecution would like to introduce would supposedly contradict that defense. To the contrary, history and experience tell us that is when the clause's guarantee of cross-examination is at its most urgent. The state never directly disputes the legal propositions I just advanced. Instead, in the state's red brief, it advances for the first time a new argument never before made in this case. According to the state's new theory, Mr. Hemphill forfeited his confrontation rights because he made supposedly improper arguments at trial. And apart from this new theory's eleventh-hour appearance, there are two major problems. First, it finds no support in the record. The Joint Appendix is crystal-clear that the reason why the trial court admitted Morris's allocution was because Mr. Hemphill claimed Mr. Morris was the shooter. He advanced a third-party defense. And the state again and again asked to introduce Mr. Morris's allocution to refute that defense. And I'll turn the Court to Joint Appendix page 185, which is where, at the top of that page, the trial court summarizes its ruling. It says the defense's argument is in -- ""in all respects is appropriate and, under the circumstances of this case, probably a necessary argument to make."" But then the trial court says, ""Nonetheless, that argument opens the door to evidence offered by the state refuting the claim that Morris was, in fact, the shooter."" The second problem with the state's new theory is that it finds no support in New York law either. New York's ""opening a door"" theory has no impropriety requirement. Instead, all it requires is the evidence the prosecution seeks to introduce to be in conflict or contradiction to the defense -- defense's own evidence or the defense's arguments. And that's why the state itself admitted at pages 4 and 5 of its brief in opposition -- I'm sorry, of its brief in opposition in this Court, just like throughout the state courts, that the reason why Morris's allocution was admitted was because it contradicted the defense, not because of any supposed impropriety. So, at bottom, what you have in front of you today is a state law rule in a holding under Reid, the New York court of appeals decision, that says that a legitimate defense based on admissible evidence can forfeit the Confrontation Clause. That rule flouts the history, purpose, and experience of the Confrontation Clause.

I guess I'm still -- you could answer that question.,"<speaker>Gina Mignola</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Now you have recognized, I think, that the Petitioner is asking for a broad and sweeping rule. He's essentially claiming that a defendant can never open the door to the admission of evidence that would otherwise be barred by the Confrontation Clause. It doesn't matter if a defendant has misled the jury, and, really, if his approach is taken to its extreme, even the traditional rule of completeness would fall. He surely is wrong about that, but I want to call your attention to the fact at New York State's highest court, he did not present that broad claim that New York's ""opening the door"" rule was unconstitutional on its face. He presented only an unconstitutional as applied to him challenge. New York's court had no occasion to consider whether the rule is unconstitutional on its face. Because he bypassed New York's high court, review of this claim should be outside of this Court's jurisdiction. Even if this Court could review the claim, it should certainly reject it. New York's rule, a trial court may provide a limited but necessary remedy when the defendant creates a misleading impression. The rule is constitutional. As this Court has recognized, like any other constitutional right, the right to be confronted with witnesses is not absolute. There are limitations. And limitations are appropriate if they have a legitimate purpose, and New York's rule does. It allows the state court to protect the vital interests that it has in the integrity and truth-seeking function of the trial process. This is not about being fair to the prosecution. It's about the jurors and the Court's duty to make sure that jurors are not unfairly misled. Moreover, a state may impose rules that govern the manner in which a defendant may assert or forfeit, even by his silence, his right of confrontation. New York's rule is an appropriate limitation in this regard. It's not an exception to the Confrontation Clause because it is not a substitute means for the prosecution to establish the reliability of evidence. It's a remedy, a remedy that is triggered when the defendant or his lawyers' intentional trial conduct violates the state's prohibition against misleading the jury. I do welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2021,coherent,"{

RLUIPA, like RFRA, like the pre-Smith free exercise jurisprudence of this Court, requires an individualized determination. That's been the law for a long time. RFRA's been on the books for a long time. It's a completely workable standard. It's regrettable it wasn't extended to the Free Exercise Clause, but it is individualized. And what would be most helpful here, I think, is if we could at least identify sort of a gold standard, not to preclude individualized variations but a -- a -- something that will generally be sufficient to take into account religious demands regarding the two things that are at issue here, touching and vocalization, and accommodation of the State's interests. And we could look to the BOP, doesn't get to specify what the First Amendment requires or what RLUIPA requires, but it's a starting point. And so, if you -- you -- you've said what has happened in the past. If there are federal executions in the future, what will the BOP do? Will it -- will its policy be generally -- will its policy be no touching during the execution, vocalization allowed throughout the -- the -- the execution so long as it doesn't interfere with other communications that have to take place?","<speaker>Eric J.

But, if the compelling interest were defined differently, like, for example, to say maintaining prison security, then that wouldn't rule out those kinds of gatherings. And so, here, if -- if the prison defines the compelling interest in saying, like, well, we in Alabama want a zero percent risk or we in Texas want only a 2 percent risk, that permits them to -- to altogether bar the spiritual advisor from the chamber, right, because there's not going to be any, you know, lesser restrictive alternative that's going to get you there.

Like all discrimination based on religion, it should be subjected to strict scrutiny and held unconstitutional, unless Maine can show that it is necessary to achieve a compelling government interest. Maine cannot make such a showing, and the First Circuit never held that it could. Instead, the First Circuit held that there are two kinds of religious discrimination, the bad kind and the good kind. The First Circuit recognized that Maine cannot discriminate against students or schools because they are religious, but it held the state is perfectly free to discriminate against students or schools because they do religious things, such as teach or receive instruction in religion. The First Circuit was wrong. Religious discrimination is religious discrimination, and unless it can survive strict scrutiny, it is unconstitutional. The First Circuit's refusal to apply strict scrutiny based on a supposed status use distinction was baseless. There's no basis for a use-based departure from strict scrutiny in the text of the Free Exercise Clause. There's no basis for it in this Court's free exercise precedent. And there is no basis for it in common sense. Religious schools, after all, teach religion, just as a soccer team plays soccer or a book club reads books. Yes, it is part of what they do. It is also part of who they are. Of course, religious schools also teach secular subjects and satisfy every secular requirement to participate in the tuition assistance program. It is only because of religion that they are excluded. You can call that discrimination based on religious use. You can call it discrimination based on religious status. Call it what you will.

4263,2021.20-1088-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett,"Thank you. And my question is as follows. It kind of goes back to Justice Thomas's questions about rough equivalent of a public school. So all schools, in making choices about curriculum and the formation of children, have to come from some belief system. And in public schools, the public school -- the school boards, the districts are making that choice, those choice of classes to be taught and the kind of values that they want to inculcate in the students. Is there any kind -- I mean, how would you even know if a -- if a school taught all religions are bigoted and biased or, you know, Catholics are bigoted or, you know -- or we take a position on the Jewish-Palestinian conflict because of our position on, you know, Jews, right? How would they even know? Because it's my understanding that in choosing whether a non-sectarian school can be funded or not, you're not engaging in that kind of oversight about what the belief systems are of the school. So long as they're not sectarian, it's a thumbs-up?","<speaker>Christopher C. Taub</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: With respect to justiciability, this case is now about one family who wants to send one child to one specific religious school. The record clearly demonstrates, though, that this one school has zero interest in taking Maine's money. Under well-established principles, the Petitioners do not have standing because, even if they were to prevail, they would receive no redress for their alleged injury. As to the merits, Maine law entitles every child to a free public education. Maine's highest court has recognized that the tuition program at issue here is intended solely to ensure that those few children who live in districts that have not made appropriate schooling arrangements are still able to receive a free public education. That is the benefit at issue here, a free public education. That private schools are sometimes enlisted to deliver the benefit is of no constitutional significance. States frequently outsource the delivery of public benefit programs, and that does not change the public nature of the program. It should be no different when it comes to education. The reason that schools that promote a particular faith are not eligible to participate is simple. Maine has determined that, as a matter of public policy, public education should be religiously neutral. This is entirely consistent with this Court's holdings that public schools must not inculcate religion and should instead promote tolerance of divergent religious views. The Petitioners want an entirely different benefit, instruction designed to instill religious beliefs at taxpayer expense. They are not being discriminated against. They simply are not being offered a benefit that no family in Maine is entitled to.

Harris</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court should not expand Bivens for the first time in 40 years. First, Bivens extensions clash with modern precedent. Bivens interpreted federal courts' jurisdiction over federal questions as authorizing courts to fashion new damages actions. Decades of intervening cases reject that premise and remove any doctrinal basis for Bivens extensions. Second, this Court has held that any reason to think Congress might doubt the efficacy or the necessity of a damages remedy bars new Bivens actions. Abbasi and Hernandez make respect for the separation of powers the key consideration. But the Constitution vests Congress alone with the power to create damages actions. Abbasi and Hernandez say courts must pause if the judiciary isn't well suited to assess the systemic costs and benefits of a new damages action. But courts are never equipped for such predictive empirical judgments. Abbasi and Hernandez also rule out Bivens extensions if Congress has extensively legislated in an area. But Congress has extensively legislated about federal officer liability without allowing individual damages actions. Third, at the very least, this Court should not expand Bivens to First Amendment retaliation claims or to Fourth Amendment claims involving border security. Those claims raise yet further grounds for pause and would explode the universe of Bivens claims. For First Amendment retaliation claims, plaintiffs could portray virtually any governmental action as unconstitutional if taken for retaliatory reasons, creating especially amorphous Bivens liability. Further, allowing First and Fourth Amendment claims against agents involved in border security also implicates national security, as Hernandez recognized. And, finally, there are many alternative means to protect these constitutional interests. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2021,coherent,"{

4829,2021.20-979-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, I don't understand your answer at all because I don't see how your interpretation in the various subdivisions you gave us give any meaning to ""regarding the granting of relief"" whatsoever. Congress need not have specified any judgment in (B)(i) as distinct from a decision or action in (B)(ii). Why didn't it just say any decision or action? It used different words, ""judgment regarding,"" and it seems to me that if ""decision or action"" is as broad as you claim it is, then ""judgment regarding the granting of relief"" has to be more narrow. You can't make it broad at the same time because, otherwise, they would have used identical language. Second, I'm not sure how we ignore neighboring subsections (a) and (c) that show when Congress wanted to strip jurisdiction broadly in the way that you want it to -- you want it to strip both factual and legal jurisdiction -- Congress knew how to do that in (a) and (c), and it could have just copied that language. Yet it used distinctive language altogether. Then add to all of this, I think all of this means that, at best, the statute is ambiguous. It's not clear. And if it's ambiguous, I don't know what to do with the presumption favoring judicial review. That's so well embedded in our jurisprudence. It's what made us decide Kucana last year.

The Sixth Circuit here blessed precisely the sort of opportunity he warned of. It held that when a federal statute prohibits ordering a prisoner's transportation with a writ of habeas corpus, courts may instead order transportation under the All Writs Act. But courts have no such power. Every All Writs order must be agreeable to the usages and principles of law, meaning the traditional writs as altered by statute.

Reaves</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In certain rare circumstances, a federal court may order a state prisoner transported under the All Writs Act. Such an order can be agreeable to the usages and principles of law because it is analogous to numerous discovery provisions and consistent with the Court's long-standing use of the Act to assist litigants in conducting factual inquiries. And a transport order may be necessary or appropriate in a Section 2254 case if a prisoner shows good cause for the order and demonstrates that equitable considerations support his transport request. The Court took this sort of authority for granted in Rees, and it should not now foreclose courts from issuing transport orders under the All Writs Act. This Court has repeatedly rejected the warden's proposition that an order may be issued under the Act only if there's a common law analogue. And the warden's sweeping assertion that Section 2241(c) governs all prisoner transport relies on an atextual reading of that provision and a misunderstanding of habeas corpus. I'd welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2021,coherent,"{
