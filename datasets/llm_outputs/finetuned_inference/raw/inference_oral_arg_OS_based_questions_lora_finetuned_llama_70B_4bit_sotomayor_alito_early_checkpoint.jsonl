A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law.

A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies. Legal dictionaries at the time Congress enacted Section 1988 defined  \"prevailing party\" based on whether the party had successfully maintained its claim, looking to the end of the suit, not on its degree of success at earlier stages. This Court's precedent similarly provides that liability for fees and liability on the merits go hand in hand.

So, in your view, if a person brings a lawsuit and the other side settles, the person who brought the lawsuit is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> If the person who brought the lawsuit is awarded summary judgment, that person is a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> What if the other side appeals and the court of appeals reverses the summary judgment? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, in your view, it's not the judgment that's entered that determines who is a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if you're right, then the preliminary injunction, the district court entered a judgment that the preliminary injunction should issue, and that's a judgment. </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So the person who won that judgment is a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> I don't know that I understand that. I thought you were saying that the only time someone is a prevailing party is when the case is over, when there's no more appeal, and they win. </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if there's a summary judgment, if there's a preliminary injunction, if there's a trial, if there's a settlement, in all of those situations, the person who gets the benefit of that is a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So what do we do with the fact that in this case the district court did not enter a judgment? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> I'm sorry, what did you say? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> No, I thought the district court did enter a judgment. It entered a judgment that the case was moot. </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if that's the case, then the district court was saying, I'm not entering a judgment on the merits, I'm entering a judgment that this case is over. </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if you're right, that that's a judgment, then the district court has the power to enter a judgment. </END_Q>\n<START_Q> I'm sorry, say that again. </END_Q>\n<START_Q> I'm not quite understanding your answer. </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, in your view, when the district court said, I'm not going to enter a judgment, that was a judgment? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it's not a judgment, then how do you know that the preliminary injunction wasn't a judgment? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if the district court has the power to enter a judgment, and it didn't, then, if it didn't, why would the preliminary injunction be a judgment? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if we go back to your first answer, if the person who brings a lawsuit and the other side settles, that person is a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if that person is a prevailing party, why isn't the person who gets a preliminary injunction a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if that person is a prevailing party, then the district court has the power to enter a judgment, and if it does, that person is a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, that person is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, then the person who gets a preliminary injunction is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, then the person who gets a settlement is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, then the person who wins a summary judgment is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, then the person who wins a trial is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, then the person who wins a preliminary injunction is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, then the person who wins a trial is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, then the person who wins a summary judgment is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, then the person who wins a settlement is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, then the person who wins a preliminary injunction is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, then the person who wins a trial is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, then the person who wins a summary judgment is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, then the person who wins a settlement is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, then the person who wins a preliminary injunction is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, then the person who wins a trial is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, then the person who wins a summary judgment is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, then the person who wins a settlement is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, then the person who wins a preliminary injunction is not a prevailing party? </END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if it doesn't enter a judgment, then the person who wins a trial is not a prevailing party?

You're saying that the statute doesn't cover personal injuries. And I think that's what's confusing me because, in the normal sense, we think of personal injuries as physical injuries, right? And you're saying that's not covered, but it seems to me that the statute is covering property interests, and I don't understand how you can separate a property interest from a personal injury. So I'm just a little bit confused. I thought I understood the statute, but you're making me question my understanding of it.</text><END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So you're saying that the injury is the loss of the property, not the loss of the person?</text><END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if I'm injured in an accident and I have to go to the hospital, that's not covered?</text><END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's take a case where someone is injured, they're in a hospital bed, and they have a property interest in the medical records of their care. And the hospital is run by a RICO organization. And the hospital refuses to turn over the records because they don't want to be sued for malpractice. That's not covered?</text><END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if the hospital is run by a RICO organization, and they're selling a product that causes people to get sick, that's not covered?</text><END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if the hospital is run by a RICO organization, and they're charging people for services that they're not providing, that's covered?</text><END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if the hospital is run by a RICO organization, and they're charging people for services they're not providing, that's covered?</text><END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But, if the hospital is run by a RICO organization, and they're providing services, but they're not paying their employees, that's covered?</text><END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So the hospital is run by a RICO organization, and they're not paying their employees. That's covered?</text><END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go back to my first question. The injury is the loss of the property interest, correct?</text><END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if I'm injured in an accident and I have to go to the hospital, I have a property interest in the money that I have to pay for the hospital, correct?</text><END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if I'm injured in an accident, I have to go to the hospital, and the hospital is run by a RICO organization, I have a property interest in the money that I'm paying for the hospital?</text><END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right.

We know that from the rest of the U.S. Code, the syntax of the sentence, and the plain meaning of the word \"damages.\"  So rest of  the U.S. Code, that locution, \"damages sustained,\" appears some three dozen times in the U.S. Code. It always means compensatory damages. So we point you to the example of 18 U.S.C. 2255, where victims of crime choose between liquidated damages and damages sustained. You can't choose between liquidated damages and harm. Those have to be two measures of compensation. Syntax of the rest of the sentence. The sentence says:  Recover the damages sustained. If it meant harm, you would expect it to say \"recover for the damages sustained.\" You recover for harm. You don't recover the harm. But, if it means compensatory damages, that's a perfectly sensible sentence. And, finally, the plain meaning of \"damages.\"  Every dictionary will tell you  damages is a measure of compensation, including the treatise that Petitioners cite at page 15 of their opening brief.

We recognize we have a heavy burden on remand, but that's not the argument before you. And she said:  Look at what is trying to be redressed.

Prelogar</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Gun Control Act imposes straightforward but essential requirements. Firearms sellers and manufacturers must mark their products with serial numbers, maintain sales records, and conduct background checks. The industry has followed those conditions without difficulty for more than half a century, and those basic requirements are crucial to solving gun crimes and keeping guns out of the hands of minors, felons, and domestic abusers. But, in recent years, companies like the Respondents here have tried to circumvent those requirements. They've begun selling firearms as easy -to-assemble kits and frames and receivers that require minimal work to be made functional. They've advertised the products, in their words, as \"ridiculously easy to assemble and dummy-proof\" and touted that you can go from opening the mail to have a fully functional gun  in as little as 15 minutes, no serial number, background check, or records required. Those untraceable guns are attractive to people who can't lawfully purchase them or  who plan to use them in crimes. As a result, our nation has seen an explosion in crimes committed with ghost guns. In the face of that public safety crisis, ATF promulgated this rule to underscore two points about the Gun Control Act's plain text. First, a weapon parts kit that can readily be converted to function as a gun with common tools, often in under an hour, is a covered firearm. Second, a product is a frame or receiver under the Act even if the buyer must drill a few holes or remove a few superfluous pieces of plastic to make it functional. Both of those points are consistent with how ATF has interpreted and implemented the Act across five decades and 11 different presidential administrations. Respondents now seek a sea change in the Act's scope. They claim that if a firearm isn't a hundred percent functional, if it's  missing just one hole that could be drilled in seconds and immediately assembled into a working gun, that product can be sold to anyone online  with no background check, no records, and no serial number. That contradicts the Act's plain text, and it also contradicts common sense.

Patterson</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  This case turns on decisions made by Congress in the Gun Control Act of 1968. First, Congress altered the common understanding of \"firearm\" to include other  weapons that may readily be converted to firearms. Second, in a departure from prior federal law, Congress decided to regulate only a  single part of a firearm, the frame or receiver, and Congress did not alter the common understanding of a \"frame or receiver.\"  ATF has now exceeded its authority by operating outside of the bounds set by Congress. One, ATF has expanded the definition of \"frame or receiver\" to include items that may readily be converted to a frame or receiver. And, two, ATF has expanded the definition of \"firearm\" to include collections of parts that are not weapons and that do not include a frame or receiver. Some concern has been raised about circumvention, but, of course, complying with a statute is not circumventing it. And as this Court said in Abramski, which has already been referenced, Congress, in the Gun Control Act,  did not seek to pursue its purposes of controlling access to firearms to the nth degree. And, notably, Congress did not regulate the secondary market for firearms, and that secondary market is a much bigger source of firearms for criminals than privately made firearms. There also has been questions raised about the agency's prior practice. There definitely has been a sea change by the agency here. The agency projected that its rule would put 42 out of 43 unlicensed manufacturers out of business. And what the agency said in the Syracuse litigation was they said:  \"An unfinished frame or receiver does not meet the statutory definition of 'firearm' simply because it can be designed to or can readily be converted into a frame or receiver.\"  That's the exact standard t hey've now adopted. Instead, what they looked at was whether critical machining operations had taken place. And, to be clear, we have no quarrel with that prior practice. We have raised as alternatives, one, something has to be  completely machined, or, two, the critical machining operation test. And the -- the latter, we submit, is more consistent with the statutory language and solves the machine gun problem because, if you say, in the machine gun provision, a frame or receiver is also regulated, and if one hole is all that separates a semi-automatic receiver from a machine gun receiver, it's hard to see how the \"readily\" standard would not also be applied there.

Second, in a departure from prior federal law, Congress decided to regulate only a  single part of a firearm, the frame or receiver, and Congress did not alter the common understanding of a \"frame or receiver.\"  ATF has now exceeded its authority by operating outside of the bounds set by Congress. One, ATF has expanded the definition of \"frame or receiver\" to include items that may readily be converted to a frame or receiver. And, two, ATF has expanded the definition of \"firearm\" to include collections of parts that are not weapons and that do not include a frame or receiver. Some concern has been raised about circumvention, but, of course, complying with a statute is not circumventing it. And as this Court said in Abramski, which has already been referenced, Congress, in the Gun Control Act,  did not seek to pursue its purposes of controlling access to firearms to the nth degree.

Shanmugam</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Ninth Circuit has adopted an outlying rule that threatens to create a sweeping regime of securities liability for omissions. The Ninth Circuit held that a risk disclosure can be misleading  simply because a company does not disclose that the specified triggering event for the risk had occurred in the past. That holding was incorrect. A risk disclosure warrants that a type of event may cause harm in the future. It usually makes no representation that the event had never previously occurred. The Ninth Circuit's approach would trigger serious concerns about over-disclosure and fraud by hindsight, and this Court should reject it. Instead, the Court should adopt a similar approach to the one it took for statements of opinion in Omnicare. There, the Court held that statements of opinion were  ordinarily not actionable as false statements, but the Court recognized that a statement of opinion could be misleading based on an embedded representation about how the speaker formed the opinion. So too here, depending on the content of the statement, a forward-looking risk disclosure can be misleading based on an embedded premise about the current state of affairs. But just as a statement that the road may be flooded if it rains cannot be misleading simply because it rained yesterday, a typical risk disclosure cannot be misleading simply because the triggering event had occurred in the past. Under the correct approach, this case is an easy one. Meta's warnings that business harm could result in the event of data misuse did not imply that Meta had never previously suffered such misuse. But, in any event, the  initial misuse of the data had been publicly reported by the time Meta made the statements at  issue, and Respondents have abandoned any claim based on the continued misuse of the data. And  far from being virtually certain to cause a risk of harm to Meta's business, the initial misuse of the data did not result in any harm when it was publicly reported.

And I think you've conceded that the information that was omitted here was material. It was material to the public. It was material to the stock price. So the only question is whether it was misleading. And I think that's what I'm struggling with. How can you say that a statement that says we're going to do X and it's going to be good for the company, and you don't tell people that you've already done it and it's been bad, how is that not misleading?</START_Q>\n        <START_Q> I'm sorry. What -- what was the --</START_Q>\n        <START_Q> I'm sorry. What was the statement?</START_Q>\n        <START_Q> I think, Justice Sotomayor, the -- the statement was that if our users do not perceive our platforms as offering useful, reliable, and novel services, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise achieve our business objectives.</START_Q>\n        <START_Q> So, if we don't do this, it's going to be bad for the company. And you're saying that that statement is not misleading when you don't tell them that you've already done it and it's been bad?</START_Q>\n        <START_Q> I think that that statement, Justice Sotomayor, is not misleading, and it's not misleading for two reasons. The first is that it's a statement about what may happen in the future. It's a statement about what may happen if users do not perceive our platforms as offering useful, reliable, and novel services. It is not a statement about what has happened in the past. And the second reason why it's not misleading is that the information about what had happened in the past was already publicly available at the time that Meta made the statements at issue. And I think that that's an important point for a couple of reasons. First of all, I think that it suggests that the statements at issue were not misleading because the information that Respondents point to as the basis for the alleged misstatement was already publicly available. But, second, I think it's also important because I think that the Ninth Circuit's approach would have significant consequences for over-disclosure and fraud by hindsight.</START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Well, it's not -- it's not fraud by hindsight. It's fraud by omission. And the question is, how do you omit a material fact that's misleading? You're saying that it's not misleading because it was already publicly known, but I don't understand that answer because the stock price went down when the information came out, and I don't know that the public knew it.</START_Q>\n        <START_Q> So, Justice Sotomayor, I think that there are a couple of responses to that. First of all, I think that the stock price did not go down when the information came out. The stock price went down when the information came out in April 2018, and that's because the information was new at that time. But, by the time that Meta made the statements at issue, the information had already been publicly reported. And, in fact, the information had been publicly reported in the spring of 2018, and it had been publicly reported again in the fall of 2018. So I think that the information was already out there. And I think that that's important because it suggests that there's no basis for liability.</START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Well, if the information was already out there, why did the stock price go down?</START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Because the information was new when it came out. And I think that that's the critical point. The information was new in the spring of 2018. It was not new when Meta made the statements at issue. And I think that that's a critical distinction because it goes to the question of whether there was any basis for liability.</START_Q>\n        <START_Q> So the information was out there, but it wasn't known by the public?</START_Q>\n        <START_Q> I think that the information was out there, but it was not new at the time that Meta made the statements at issue. And I think that that's the critical point. And I think that that's the point that the Ninth Circuit missed. The Ninth Circuit, I think, focused on the fact that the information was out there, but it missed the point that the information was not new when Meta made the statements at issue. And I think that that's the critical point because it goes to the question of whether there was any basis for liability.</START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Thank you.</START_Q><|eot_id|>"}

First, as to the actual question presented, we agree that a risk disclosure is not misleading because it omits disclosure of an event that is immaterial because it risks no  business harm. The Ninth Circuit did not hold otherwise. Second, we agree that in addition to proving materiality, plaintiffs must also show  that the risk statement implies that the omitted event did not occur. We don't claim that every risk statement includes that implication. Our position is simply that they can and frequently do, and that ultimately depends on the facts and context of each case. Third, for that reason, the Court should reject Facebook's categorical rule that Item 105 statements are always agnostic about whether the risk has transpired in the past. Facebook admits that if a student tells his parents that there's a risk he may fail an exam when he's already done so, that is misleading because it implies it's impossible that he won't when that isn't true. The same is true of many risk factor statements, including the ones at issue in this case stating that the  -- describing an improper disclosure of user data as a hypothetical risk implied that it was possible it wouldn't occur. And that wasn't  possible because it already had. This does not mean that issuers must disclose every material occurrence of a risk. They simply must say enough to remove the false impression that the omitted event has not yet materialized, something they generally can do, as Facebook did here with respect to hacking, by simply acknowledging that the risk has materialized in the past. Finally, the Ninth Circuit did not adopt any contrary categorical rule. The Court did not discuss whether these particular statements were agnostic about the past because Facebook never argued that they were. It elected instead to argue only that the warned-of risks had not transpired because it viewed the warned -of risks as speaking only to hacking events and business harm. Because Facebook does not challenge the Ninth Circuit's fact-bound rejection of those claims in this Court, this Court should provide any necessary guidance for future cases in the course of affirming the judgment.

The Ninth Circuit did not hold otherwise. Second, we agree that in addition to proving materiality, plaintiffs must also show  that the risk statement implies that the omitted event did not occur. We don't claim that every risk statement includes that implication. Our position is simply that they can and frequently do, and that ultimately depends on the facts and context of each case. Third, for that reason, the Court should reject Facebook's categorical rule that Item 105 statements are always agnostic about whether the risk has transpired in the past. Facebook admits that if a student tells his parents that there's a risk he may fail an exam when he's already done so, that is misleading because it implies it's impossible that he won't when that isn't true. The same is true of many risk factor statements, including the ones at issue in this case stating that the  -- describing an improper disclosure of user data as a hypothetical risk implied that it was possible it wouldn't occur. And that wasn't  possible because it already had. This does not mean that issuers must disclose every material occurrence of a risk. They simply must say enough to remove the false impression that the omitted event has not yet materialized, something they generally can do, as Facebook did here with respect to hacking, by simply acknowledging that the risk has materialized in the past. Finally, the Ninth Circuit did not adopt any contrary categorical rule. The Court did not discuss whether these particular statements were agnostic about the past because Facebook never argued that they were. It elected instead to argue only that the warned-of risks had not transpired because it viewed the warned -of risks as speaking only to hacking events and business harm. Because Facebook does not challenge the Ninth Circuit's fact-bound rejection of those claims in this Court, this Court should provide any necessary guidance for future cases in the course of affirming the judgment. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>\n\n        ### Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nA list of questions that Justice Sonia Sotomayor is likely to ask:\n<START_Q> Mr. Russell, I think you're going to have to help me with this, because I think there's a little bit of confusion. I don't understand your answer to Justice Thomas's question. I don't know that it's a yes or no, but I don't understand the \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. I'm going to try to articulate it. I think what you're saying is that there is a difference between a statement that says \"we might do this\" and \"we might have done this.\" And so, if you say \"we might do this,\" then you don't have to disclose that you've already done it, but if you say \"we might have done this,\" then you do have to disclose that you've already done it. Is that a correct articulation of your position?</END_Q>\n<START_Q> Well, I think that's a little bit of an oversimplification, but it's close enough for me to work with.</END_Q>\n<START_Q> So explain it to me.</END_Q>\n<START_Q> So I think that the -- the statement that you're describing, that says \"we might do this,\" that's a statement that says something like \"we might have a data breach,\" or \"we might have a cyber attack.\" And that statement, as I read the Ninth Circuit, does not say anything about whether a breach or a cyber attack has occurred in the past. It's focused on the future. And so it doesn't say anything about whether it has happened in the past. It doesn't say it hasn't happened in the past, but it doesn't say it has happened in the past. And that's the kind of statement that the Ninth Circuit said was not misleading because it was focused on the future. And then the Ninth Circuit contrasted that with the statements in this case, which said \"we might have a data breach\" or \"we might have a cyber attack.\" And the Ninth Circuit said those statements, because they're focused on the past, do say something about whether the risk has materialized in the past. And so, if the risk has materialized in the past, that statement is misleading because it says that the risk is just hypothetical, that it hasn't occurred yet. And that's why the Ninth Circuit found that those statements were misleading.</END_Q>\n<START_Q> So, if you say \"we might have a cyber attack,\" that's different than saying \"we might have a cyber attack in the future\"?</END_Q>\n<START_Q> Well, I think that the --</END_Q>\n<START_Q> Why is that different?</END_Q>\n<START_Q> -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the

Nothing in 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 makes clear that it was meant to preempt neutral jurisdictional rules like the one at issue here. Petitioners' reliance on Patsy ignores the key difference between exhaustion rules created by Congress and exhaustion doctrines crafted by courts. The former may preempt, but the latter do not. They are judge-made timing rules, like ripeness and abstention, that do not add elements to a federal right but merely determine when a federal court is going to hear it. This Court's ripeness and abstention holdings do not apply to state courts. Nor does  its determination that federal courts generally should not send 1983 plaintiffs to the states. Precedent confirms that 1983 does not contain a categorical no -exhaustion element. In Johnson v. Fankell, the Court did not require immediate appellate review of a 1983 defense. In Ohio Civil Rights Commission v. Dayton Christian Schools from 1986, this Court applied Younger abstention to force a 1983 plaintiff back into state agency proceedings. These decisions show that deferring consideration of a federal right does not necessarily alter or defeat it. Thus, while some notice of claims rules, like the one in Felder, are preempted as obstacles to adjudication and liability, agency review is typically a means of adjudication and does not inherently conflict with 1983's remedial purpose. But, even if immediate judicial consideration were an unwritten element of 1983,  neutral jurisdictional rules like Alabama's are still a valid excuse for declining jurisdiction. Reading 1983 to preempt such laws would raise serious constitutional questions that are best avoided.

Blatt</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  For over a century, this Court has held that the default standard in civil cases is preponderance of the evidence. That default rule should resolve this case. Nothing in the text suggests that Congress intended a clear and convincing evidence standard to apply to the 34 exemptions under the Fair Labor Standard  -- Fair Labor Standards Act. Respondent  --Respondents argue that a heightened standard is appropriate because FLSA rights are important. But a preponderance standard applies to rights against race discrimination and disability discrimination and rights to organize and to workplace safety, all super-important rights. This Court has reserved the clear and convincing standard to deprivations by the government of critical rights that don't involve money damages. This Court has never allowed plaintiffs to use a clear and convincing  standard as a sword, and it certainly has never read a clear and convincing standard into a statute for money damages. Respondents also argue that overtime rights aren't waivable. But waivability and standards of proof are unrelated and don't go hand in hand. Waivability goes to who owns the right, the government or the individual, and the standard of proof goes to how hard it is to prove that the right attaches in the first place. Thus, the preponderance of the evidence standard governs non-waivable rights, such as those under the NLRA and OSHA, and heightened standards govern waivable rights, such as those in criminal trials and deportation hearings. Because the court below applied only the clear and convincing standard, we think this Court should remand for the application of the preponderance standard. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>\n\n        ### Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nA list of questions that Justice Sonia Sotomayor is likely to ask:\n<START_Q>Ms. Blatt, I -- I have a problem with your argument that this is a question of waiver. I think that the question of whether a claim is waivable or not is a question of whether a party can contract out of the statute. And that's not what's at issue here. This is a question of whether a party can release claims that have already been violated. And I think that's a different question. So, if we go to the purpose of the FLSA, which is to protect workers, it seems to me that a release of claims that have already been violated is different than a contract that says, I will not be entitled to anything, even though I'm entitled to it. And that's the question that's before us. So how do we get from your waiver argument to this question of release?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Ms. Blatt, you -- you said something that I want to follow up on, and that is that this is a question of the government's right or the individual's right. And I think that's an important question. But, in the context of the FLSA, the question is, who is the government? Is it the Secretary of Labor or is it the court? Because the FLSA says that the Secretary of Labor can come in and bring an action. And the Secretary of Labor, in its brief, says that it doesn't care about these kinds of cases. It's not interested in them. It's interested in the big cases, the systemic cases, the ones that have a big impact. So, if we're talking about the government's right, the government has said, we don't care about this. So why should we care?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Ms. Blatt, I'm sorry. I'm going to stop you there. I don't think the question is whether it's a collective action or an individual action. I think the question is whether the FLSA permits an individual to release a claim that has already been violated. And the government says it doesn't. And I don't know that that's the same question as whether it's a collective action or an individual action. So how do we get from one to the other?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Ms. Blatt, can I ask you this? What would be the effect of a ruling that an individual who has already been paid overtime can't release the claim? What would be the effect of that on collective actions? Because I'm not sure that I understand that. I mean, the Secretary of Labor doesn't care about these cases. They're not interested in them. They want the big cases. So what would be the effect of that?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Ms. Blatt, I'm sorry, I'm going to interrupt you. But I think the question is not whether it's a collective action or not. I think the question is, can an individual who has already been paid overtime release the claim? And the government says no. And I don't know that that's the same question as whether it's a collective action or not. So how do we get from one to the other?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Ms. Blatt, I'm sorry, I'm going to interrupt you. But I think the question is not whether it's a collective action or not. I think the question is, can an individual who has already been paid overtime release the claim? And the government says no.

These questions should reflect the justice\u2019s known priorities, jurisprudence, and typical questioning style, and they should be directly relevant to the arguments presented in the opening statement.\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Carefully analyze the opening statement to identify key arguments, assumptions, or ambiguities.\n        2. Generate questions that the specified justice might ask. Limit to 15 or less questions. Do not repeat questions.\n        3. Format each question with specific start and end tags for easier parsing:\n           - Use `<START_Q>` at the beginning of each question.\n           - Use `<END_Q>` at the end of each question.\n\n        ### Example:\n        ### Your Task:\n        Justice: {justice_name}\n        Opening Statement: {opening_statement}\n\n        ### Output:\n        A list of questions that {justice_name} is likely to ask:\n        <START_Q> text of question one <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> text of question two <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> text of question three <END_Q><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Your Task:\n        Justice: Justice Sonia Sotomayor\n        Opening Statement: <speaker>Tejinder Singh</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  When Wisconsin Bell requests E-rate funds, the government provides the money. The administrator pays on the government's behalf using money the government collects and controls  to advance a federal program that the government created. FCC mandates, which the administrator must follow, specify who must be paid and how much they must be paid. So, when the administrator paid Wisconsin Bell, that was the government providing money through its agent. Indeed, many government programs, including most notably Medicare, use private claims administrators to provide billions of dollars to beneficiaries of government programs. As Justice Kagan's soup hypothetical, Justice Barrett's proctor hypothetical illustrate, when an entity like the government provides money through agents, we credit the principal in that situation. So, when Wisconsin Bell  receives money, claims money, from the E-rate program, we credit the government with providing it. FCC mandates also  determine carriers' obligations to contribute to the Universal Service Fund. Those mandates are how the government provided funds to this program, and  it doesn't matter that the government routed the funds directly from the carriers to the  Universal Service Fund instead of requiring an unnecessary detour through federal Treasury accounts because the False Claims Act's applicability doesn't turn on bookkeeping conventions, which is also a point Ms. Ho made, I think, quite well. The point is not exactly how did the money move through a bureaucracy, was it routed efficiently or less efficiently. The point is who is really making the money move, and it is the government. The government is the only relevant decision-maker at all stages of creating, funding, and then controlling the distributions from this program. The administrator merely does what the government wants. Under the plain meaning of the word \"provide,\" the government therefore provides the money Wisconsin Bell claims. That's true of all the money and especially the hundred million  that was discussed more -- earlier. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>\n\n        ### Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nA list of questions that Justice Sonia Sotomayor is likely to ask:\n<START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Mr. Singh, you're -- you're saying it's the government providing it, but, in fact, you're not suing the government.

So how is it that you're suing the company when you say the government is providing the money?</END_Q>\n<START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Justice Sotomayor:  Well, it's the government that's providing the money, but the government is not the one who's making the false claim.

The Generic Prohibitions revive the very \"cause or contribute\" standard Congress repealed. And they do not function as discharge limitations. As the Second Circuit recognized, they add nothing that tells a permitholder how  to control its discharges. EPA claims it uses the Generic Prohibitions as a backstop, an insurance policy against changing circumstances. But the Clean  Water Act already gives EPA all the tools it needs to address uncertainty. EPA can reopen, modify, or terminate a permit when conditions change, and it can exercise its statutory authority to protect public welfare in emergencies. What EPA cannot do is expose permitholders to liability based on receiving water conditions it cannot control. The Generic Prohibitions are also inconsistent with the Act's permit shield. The shield protects permitholders from liability as long as they comply with their permit terms. But, by imposing indeterminate requirements, the Generic Prohibitions prevent permitholders from relying on the shield's protections. San Francisco is therefore exposed to crushing criminal and civil penalties even when it otherwise complies with its 300-page permit.

Steeley</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Section 301(b)(1)(C) of the Clean Water Act assigns EPA the job of setting the effluent limitations necessary to meet and implement water quality standards. The water quality standards are not the limitations themselves. Instead, they set the goals for the water body. EPA must translate those goals into discharge limitations. The Generic Prohibitions fail this task. As Judge Collins explained below, the Generic Prohibitions erase the distinction between water quality standards and discharge limitations, making them one and the same. The Generic Prohibitions revive the very \"cause or contribute\" standard Congress repealed. And they do not function as discharge limitations. As the Second Circuit recognized, they add nothing that tells a permitholder how  to control its discharges. EPA claims it uses the Generic Prohibitions as a backstop, an insurance policy against changing circumstances. But the Clean  Water Act already gives EPA all the tools it needs to address uncertainty. EPA can reopen, modify, or terminate a permit when conditions change, and it can exercise its statutory authority to protect public welfare in emergencies.

Why isn't it a one-size-fits-all?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if I understand you correctly, you're saying that if the EPA were to say, as it did here, we're going to have a zero discharge requirement, we're not going to have any other requirements, that would be fine?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if I understand you, you're saying that the EPA can set a zero discharge standard as long as it sets some other standards that it has to meet, correct?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So it can't do it alone, but it can do it with something else, correct?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So it can't do it alone, but it can do it with something else, correct?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right.  So what's the difference between that and what they did here?  They said, if you're in compliance with the permit, you're in compliance, but we're also going to have this additional requirement, correct?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if I understand you, the EPA can't do this, but the EPA can do what you just told me it could do, correct?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And what's the difference between the two?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's what you said, that it could set a zero discharge standard as long as it has some other standard, correct?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right.  So let's go to the other point, which is, is it -- is it -- is it clear that this permit is a zero discharge permit?  The district court said that it was a zero discharge permit, but the Ninth Circuit said no, it wasn't, correct?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if I understand you, you're saying that this is a zero discharge permit, correct?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if it's not, then what is it?  What does it say?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right.  So, if it's not a zero discharge permit, then what is it?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what is it?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what is it?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right.  So let's go to the other point, which is, if we're not sure what this permit says, why isn't that a reason to grant cert?  Because I think that's a big part of the dispute between the parties, correct?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why isn't that a reason to grant cert?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia

So why don't we look at the original claim?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Why -- why isn't that the original claim?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And then, once you've done that, why do we look at the amended complaint?  Why isn't that the end of the analysis?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what you're saying is that the removal statute is an independent jurisdictional basis, and so, even though the district court doesn't have original jurisdiction, it has removal jurisdiction?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So now you're saying that the removal jurisdiction is not an original jurisdiction. It's a separate jurisdiction. So, if it's a separate jurisdiction, how does 1367 apply to it?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So 1367 applies to the original jurisdiction. But the original jurisdiction is over the claims that are stated in the complaint. So, if the original jurisdiction is over the claims that are stated in the complaint, why do we look at the amended complaint?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if we look at the amended complaint, why don't we look at the amended complaint after the remand?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm not sure I understand your answer. I thought you were saying that 1367 applied to the original jurisdiction. If it's the original jurisdiction, then it's the original complaint. If it's the removal jurisdiction, then it's the amended complaint. Which is it?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So you're saying that the original jurisdiction is the removal jurisdiction?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So the original jurisdiction is the removal jurisdiction. So then the question is, is the original jurisdiction the original complaint or the amended complaint?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I don't understand why you're looking at the amended complaint. 1367 talks about original jurisdiction. The original jurisdiction is the complaint that was filed. If it's the removal jurisdiction, then you're looking at the amended complaint. But, if it's the original jurisdiction, it's the original complaint.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm sorry. I'm not following you. If the original jurisdiction is the removal jurisdiction, then you're looking at the amended complaint. If the original jurisdiction is the original jurisdiction, then you're looking at the original complaint. So what are we looking at?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So we're looking at the original complaint. So, if we're looking at the original complaint, why are we looking at the amended complaint?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Why are we looking at the amended complaint?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I thought you said that 1367 applies to the original jurisdiction.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So the original jurisdiction is the removal jurisdiction?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So then you're looking at the amended complaint.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So you're looking at the amended complaint. So why isn't the amended complaint the amended complaint after remand?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if we're looking at the amended complaint, why isn't the amended complaint the amended complaint after remand?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So you're looking at the original complaint. So why are you looking at the amended complaint?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm sorry. I'm not following you. You're saying that 1367 applies to the original jurisdiction, but the original jurisdiction is the removal jurisdiction. So then you're looking at the amended complaint.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why isn't the amended complaint the amended complaint after remand?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So the amended complaint after remand is the amended complaint that you're looking at.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if you're looking at the amended complaint after remand, then why isn't that the end of the analysis?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why isn't that the end of the analysis?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why isn't that the end of the analysis?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why isn't that the end of the

In context, that requirement applies not just to the day of approval but to the next day as well.

If Congress believed you shouldn't get that piece of paper saying that you're eligible when you've been in a sham marriage, then -- then the agency has to take it away when it determines that you're not, in fact, eligible.

Yet it identifies no circumstance in which it has ever or would ever exercise that purported discretion. Nor does it explain what purpose such discretion could serve if, as the government appears to believe, it's not actually allowed to give the beneficiary a green card. The discretion appears to simply be the discretion to allow a person to hold on to a now meaningless piece of paper that has been drained of all of its value. That cannot be the kind  of discretion that Congress sought to protect. The government's view also layers one anomaly on top of another. Most significantly, it creates a disparity in review between an initial decision and a reconsideration of that same decision based on the same criteria.

In context, that requirement applies not just to the day of approval but to the next day as well. In other words, the petition cannot remain approved if the agency reconsiders its initial decision and concludes that there was a sham marriage. That's because an approved visa petition confers no substantive benefits. It is simply a piece of paper signifying that a beneficiary is eligible to apply for a green card. If Congress believed you shouldn't get that piece of paper saying that you're eligible when you've been in a sham marriage, then -- then the agency has to take it away when it determines that you're not, in fact, eligible. That resolves this case. Because the revocation here was non-discretionary, it is reviewable. The government seeks to shield  itself from judicial review by claiming it has discretion to not revoke the petition even after a sham -marriage finding. Yet it identifies no circumstance in which it has ever or would ever exercise that purported discretion. Nor does it explain what purpose such discretion could serve if, as the government appears to believe, it's not actually allowed to give the beneficiary a green card. The discretion appears to simply be the discretion to allow a person to hold on to a now meaningless piece of paper that has been drained of all of its value. That cannot be the kind  of discretion that Congress sought to protect. The government's view also layers one anomaly on top of another. Most significantly, it creates a disparity in review between an initial decision and a reconsideration of that same decision based on the same criteria. And the government concedes that a person could obtain review if they filed a new -- a new petition and had it denied. But that gives the game away. That is the exact same non-discretionary decision  that the government claims needs to be shielded from review. The only difference is years of  additional delay where families and children live under constant fear that they will be separated. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>\n\n        ### Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nA list of questions that Justice Sonia Sotomayor is likely to ask:\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, what's the purpose of this provision?  It's -- it's not the only one that has this kind of language.  But, in the context of immigration, why would Congress have wanted to give the government the discretion to not revoke a petition, even if it finds out that there's been a sham marriage?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you, but I'm not quite sure I understand your answer.  What do you mean by \"it's not really a green card\"?  It's a petition that's been approved.  It's a -- it's a -- it's a green card application that's been approved.  And, normally, when we think of discretion, we think of a decision that's not based on a law, that's based on the exercise of some kind of judgment.  And it's not clear to me that that's what this is.  This is a -- a decision based on a finding of fact, which is that there was a sham marriage.  So I don't understand why the government would have discretion not to revoke a petition that it has determined was based on a sham marriage.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's not what the government is saying.  The government is saying that it has discretion to not revoke the petition.  And I'm asking you, what is the purpose of that discretion?  What would be the purpose of Congress giving the government the discretion to say, I'm not going to revoke this petition, even though I know there's a sham marriage?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what is the purpose of the discretion?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, I think that's the question.  Why would Congress have wanted to give the government the discretion to do something that seems to be a legal determination?  And that's the question that I'm asking you.  And if you don't have an answer to that, that's fine.  But I'm just not quite sure that I understand why Congress would have wanted to give the government that kind of discretion.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Thank you.</END_Q><|eot_id|>"}

It's not like Medicare. It's not like Medicaid. It's not like Social Security. Those are programs. You get a card, you get a number, you're entitled to benefits. And so I'm a little concerned that we're going to have to do a lot of work to understand what you mean by the SSI program, because, in fact, the SSI program is not like that. It's a benefit. It's a cash benefit, and it's a cash benefit that's paid to people who are needy, who are disabled, who are elderly, and who are blind. And so I'm not quite sure what you mean by the SSI program, because, as I read the statute, there's no such thing as an SSI program. There's a benefit that is paid to people who meet the criteria. So help me out.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Ms. Sherry, I'm sorry, but I'm still a little confused.

Bostwick</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  In Gilbert, one of its earliest decisions, the newly created Veterans Court recognized both the importance of the benefit-of-the -doubt principle and the difference between reviewing findings of fact for clear error and reviewing VA's application of the approximate balance standard of proof as a matter of law, but the Veterans Court soon strayed from that understanding, and by 2001, the court had declared that the agency's approximate balance assessment can be reviewed only under the deferential clear error standard of 7261(a)(4). Congress responded by changing the statute. It directed the Veterans Court to take  due account of the Secretary's application of Section 5107(b), the benefit-of-the -doubt statute, and that new statutory command, unique in administrative review, directed to a specialized Article I tribunal reviewing a uniquely pro-claimant agency process, must be given effect. Petitioners have provided an account of Section 7261(b)(1)'s plain text that gives effect to all parts of the statute and allows for the meaningful and independent judicial scrutiny that Congress intended. Yet the government insists that the statute not only requires nothing that wasn't already required by Section (a) before 2002 but also requires the one thing we know Congress didn't want. Under its view, the Veterans Court does not even look at the agency's benefit-of-the -doubt rulings unless a -- so long as no factual finding specifically challenged by the veteran is infected with clear error. That is also what the Veterans Court and the Federal Circuit held in these cases. Their decisions render Congress's statutory amendment entirely superfluous. They mean that  a uniquely generous standard of proof is reviewed in a uniquely ungenerous way. And, if  upheld, they will allow the agency's non-compliance with its statutory mandate to continue unchecked. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>\n\n        ### Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nA list of questions that Justice Sonia Sotomayor is likely to ask:\n<START_Q>Ms. Bostwick, I'm a little bit concerned about the language that you're using. You keep saying \"approximate balance of positive and negative evidence.\"  I'm not sure that that's the right way to look at it. I think of it more as a preponderance of the evidence. If you have 50 percent of the evidence for you, 50 percent against you, you win. That's the way I've always understood the benefit of the doubt rule. Am I wrong?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Ms. Bostwick, I'm sorry. Let me just -- let me just make sure I understand your answer. I'm not sure I understand the difference between the two standards. The benefit of the doubt, to me, means that if the evidence is 50/50, you win. And if it's more than 50/50 against you, you lose. And if it's more than 50/50 for you, you win. And so, if you're saying that it's not the same thing, what is it?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Ms. Bostwick, if I could just go back to something you said earlier, which is that the 2002 amendment changed the standard of review, and it's not clear error. And I think that's what I was getting at with my earlier question. What is the standard of review that you think the court is supposed to apply to the benefit of the doubt?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Ms. Bostwick, I don't want to interrupt you, but I'm not sure I understand the answer to my question. So, if you look at the statute, the statute says \"due account.\" What does that mean to you?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Ms. Bostwick, I'm sorry. I -- I'm not sure I understand your answer. So, if the -- if the statute says \"due account,\" what does that mean to you? Does it mean that the court is supposed to look at the evidence, all of the evidence, and decide whether the agency was correct or not?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Ms. Bostwick, I'm sorry. I don't understand your answer. So, if I look at the statute, it says \"due account.\" What does that mean to you?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Ms. Bostwick, I -- I'm sorry. I don't understand your answer.

It takes due account of the Secretary's application of it, and it does so in making the determinations under subsection (a).

That is, the Veterans Cour t reviews legal aspects of the Secretary's application of 5107(b) de novo and factual aspects deferentially, here, for clear error.

And so that leaves subsection (b)(1) with no additional work to do. But, when Congress enacted (b)(1) in 2002, it took what was implicit or just generally covered in (a) and made it explicit and specific. It put an exclamation point on it. That's not nothing. Think of the Tenth Amendment, for example. But, even if you think that our interpretation renders (b)(1) largely redundant, it's still better than the alternative that Petitioners offer you. Petitioners say that the approximate balance finding should be reviewed de novo. But  that creates needless contradictions in the text. It conflicts with the express standard of review Congress supplied in (a)(4). It's in  serious tension with the prohibition on trial de novo in subsection (c). It's a real divergence from standard principles of judicial review generally and judicial review of agency decisions more specifically. And it's even inconsistent with the way other factual issues under (b)(1) are reviewed, as my friend mentioned this morning, like the in-service connection or existence of a disability. If Congress intended that highly irregular result, I think the language in (b)(1) is an awfully cryptic way of going about it. So, as between two interpretations, one that's sort of consistent, coherent, with a little bit of redundancy, and one that eliminates the redundancy at the cost of a statute at war with itself, I think you should pick the former over the latter.

The text differentiates the injury from racketeering and the damages sustained from that injury, thus showing that injury and damages are distinct.

Respondent argues that every economic loss is its own RICO injury but not to worry because RICO still bars non-pecuniary damages. But that view conflates injury and damages by treating RICO's exclusion of personal injuries as just excluding a narrow type of damages: pain and suffering and emotional distress. Respondent's rule also leaves the personal exclusion toothless since virtually all personal injuries result in monetary loss. It is utterly implausible that Congress federalized every slip and fall involving RICO predicates.

We know that from the rest of the U.S. Code, the syntax of the sentence, and the plain meaning of the word \"damages.\"  So rest of  the U.S. Code, that locution, \"damages sustained,\" appears some three dozen times in the U.S. Code. It always means compensatory damages. So we point you to the example of 18 U.S.C. 2255, where victims of crime choose between liquidated damages and damages sustained. You can't choose between liquidated damages and harm. Those have to be two measures of compensation. Syntax of the rest of the sentence. The sentence says:  Recover the damages sustained. If it meant harm, you would expect it to say \"recover for the damages sustained.\" You recover for harm. You don't recover the harm.

And, finally, the plain meaning of \"damages.\"  Every dictionary will tell you  damages is a measure of compensation, including the treatise that Petitioners cite at page 15 of their opening brief.

This isn't a forfeiture or a unjust enrichment statute, right?  It's not worded that way. She said:  Look to directness. As Justice Kagan explained, that's a proximate cause problem. We recognize we have a heavy burden on remand, but that's not the argument before you. And she said:  Look at what is trying to be redressed.

Alito, Jr. is likely to ask:\n<START_Q>Well, Ms. Anand, there are a number of things that are not clear to me, and I'd like to ask you about them. First, I'd like to know whether you think that there are any RICO claims that can be brought by private parties that are not based on the violation of a legal right. And, if so, how do you distinguish between those and the ones that are based on the violation of a legal right? And, if not, then what is the basis for your argument that the RICO claim in this case is based on the violation of a legal right?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think it's clear that a legal right is the right not to be harmed by reason of the predicate acts. And so --</END_Q>\n<START_Q>And so, in the case of the RICO claim that's based on a violation of a legal right, the legal right is the right not to be harmed by reason of the predicate acts, and the harm is the loss of money?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, it's the loss of money as a result of the predicate acts. I think that's a fair way to put it.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>And so, in the case of the RICO claim that's not based on the violation of a legal right, the harm is not the loss of money?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think, in the case of a RICO claim that's not based on the violation of a legal right, the harm is not the loss of money. I think that's a fair way to put it.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, why -- why is that?  I mean, why is it that when you're talking about a violation of a legal right, the harm is the loss of money, but when you're talking about a RICO claim that's not based on the violation of a legal right, the harm is not the loss of money?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think that's because the legal right is the right not to be harmed by reason of the predicate acts. And so, when you're talking about a legal right, you're talking about the right not to be harmed by reason of the predicate acts, and that's a right to money.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, then, in a RICO claim that's not based on the violation of a legal right, the harm is what?  Is it the loss of a legal right?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think, in a RICO claim that's not based on the violation of a legal right, the harm is the harm that's caused by the predicate acts.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, what is that?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think that's the harm that's caused by the predicate acts. And so, in the human trafficking case, it's the harm that's caused by the human trafficking.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>But the harm caused by the human trafficking is the loss of money, isn't it?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think, in the human trafficking case, it's not the loss of money. It's the harm that's caused by the human trafficking.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, what is that?  I mean, you're saying that it's not the loss of money, but what is it?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think, in the human trafficking case, it's the harm that's caused by the human trafficking. I think that's a fair way to put it.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, how do you distinguish between the two?  I mean, I'm really not understanding the distinction.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think the distinction is that, in a RICO claim that's based on a violation of a legal right, the harm is the loss of money as a result of the predicate acts, and in a RICO claim that's not based on a violation of a legal right, the harm is the harm that's caused by the predicate acts.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, how do you distinguish between the two?  I mean, that's the question. I'm not understanding how you distinguish between the two.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think the way to distinguish between the two is to look at the legal right. And so, if the legal right is the right not to be harmed by reason of the predicate acts, then the harm is the loss of money as a result of the predicate acts. And if the legal right is not the right not to be harmed by reason of the predicate acts, then the harm is the harm that's caused by the predicate acts.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, what is the legal right that's violated in the human trafficking case?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think the legal right that's violated in the human trafficking case is the right not to be harmed by reason of the predicate acts.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, what is that?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think the right not to be harmed by reason of the predicate acts is the right not to be harmed by reason of the human trafficking.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, what is that?  I mean, what is the right that is violated?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think the right that's violated is the right not to be harmed by reason of the human trafficking.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, what is that?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think that's the right not to be harmed by reason of the human trafficking.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, how do you distinguish between that and the right that is violated in this case?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think the right that's violated in this case is the right not to be harmed by reason of the predicate acts.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, what is that?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think that's the right not to be harmed by reason of the predicate acts.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, what is that?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think that's the right not to be harmed by reason of the predicate acts.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, how do you distinguish between that and the right that's violated in the human trafficking case?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think the

Alito, Jr.\n        Opening Statement: <speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Gun Control Act imposes straightforward but essential requirements. Firearms sellers and manufacturers must mark their products with serial numbers, maintain sales records, and conduct background checks. The industry has followed those conditions without difficulty for more than half a century, and those basic requirements are crucial to solving gun crimes and keeping guns out of the hands of minors, felons, and domestic abusers. But, in recent years, companies like the Respondents here have tried to circumvent those requirements. They've begun selling firearms as easy -to-assemble kits and frames and receivers that require minimal work to be made functional. They've advertised the products, in their words, as \"ridiculously easy to assemble and dummy-proof\" and touted that you can go from opening the mail to have a fully functional gun  in as little as 15 minutes, no serial number, background check, or records required. Those untraceable guns are attractive to people who can't lawfully purchase them or  who plan to use them in crimes. As a result, our nation has seen an explosion in crimes committed with ghost guns. In the face of that public safety crisis, ATF promulgated this rule to underscore two points about the Gun Control Act's plain text. First, a weapon parts kit that can readily be converted to function as a gun with common tools, often in under an hour, is a covered firearm. Second, a product is a frame or receiver under the Act even if the buyer must drill a few holes or remove a few superfluous pieces of plastic to make it functional. Both of those points are consistent with how ATF has interpreted and implemented the Act across five decades and 11 different presidential administrations. Respondents now seek a sea change in the Act's scope. They claim that if a firearm isn't a hundred percent functional, if it's  missing just one hole that could be drilled in seconds and immediately assembled into a working gun, that product can be sold to anyone online  with no background check, no records, and no serial number. That contradicts the Act's plain text, and it also contradicts common sense. This Court should make clear that the Act regulates these products as what they are, firearms and frames and receivers of firearms.

First, Congress altered the common understanding of \"firearm\" to include other  weapons that may readily be converted to firearms. Second, in a departure from prior federal law, Congress decided to regulate only a  single part of a firearm, the frame or receiver, and Congress did not alter the common understanding of a \"frame or receiver.\"  ATF has now exceeded its authority by operating outside of the bounds set by Congress. One, ATF has expanded the definition of \"frame or receiver\" to include items that may readily be converted to a frame or receiver. And, two, ATF has expanded the definition of \"firearm\" to include collections of parts that are not weapons and that do not include a frame or receiver. Some concern has been raised about circumvention, but, of course, complying with a statute is not circumventing it. And as this Court said in Abramski, which has already been referenced, Congress, in the Gun Control Act,  did not seek to pursue its purposes of controlling access to firearms to the nth degree. And, notably, Congress did not regulate the secondary market for firearms, and that secondary market is a much bigger source of firearms for criminals than privately made firearms. There also has been questions raised about the agency's prior practice. There definitely has been a sea change by the agency here. The agency projected that its rule would put 42 out of 43 unlicensed manufacturers out of business. And what the agency said in the Syracuse litigation was they said:  \"An unfinished frame or receiver does not meet the statutory definition of 'firearm' simply because it can be designed to or can readily be converted into a frame or receiver.\"  That's the exact standard t hey've now adopted. Instead, what they looked at was whether critical machining operations had taken place. And, to be clear, we have no quarrel with that prior practice. We have raised as alternatives, one, something has to be  completely machined, or, two, the critical machining operation test. And the -- the latter, we submit, is more consistent with the statutory language and solves the machine gun problem because, if you say, in the machine gun provision, a frame or receiver is also regulated, and if one hole is all that separates a semi-automatic receiver from a machine gun receiver, it's hard to see how the \"readily\" standard would not also be applied there.

The Ninth Circuit held that a risk disclosure can be misleading  simply because a company does not disclose that the specified triggering event for the risk had occurred in the past. That holding was incorrect. A risk disclosure warrants that a type of event may cause harm in the future. It usually makes no representation that the event had never previously occurred. The Ninth Circuit's approach would trigger serious concerns about over-disclosure and fraud by hindsight, and this Court should reject it. Instead, the Court should adopt a similar approach to the one it took for statements of opinion in Omnicare. There, the Court held that statements of opinion were  ordinarily not actionable as false statements, but the Court recognized that a statement of opinion could be misleading based on an embedded representation about how the speaker formed the opinion. So too here, depending on the content of the statement, a forward-looking risk disclosure can be misleading based on an embedded premise about the current state of affairs. But just as a statement that the road may be flooded if it rains cannot be misleading simply because it rained yesterday, a typical risk disclosure cannot be misleading simply because the triggering event had occurred in the past. Under the correct approach, this case is an easy one. Meta's warnings that business harm could result in the event of data misuse did not imply that Meta had never previously suffered such misuse. But, in any event, the  initial misuse of the data had been publicly reported by the time Meta made the statements at  issue, and Respondents have abandoned any claim based on the continued misuse of the data. And  far from being virtually certain to cause a risk of harm to Meta's business, the initial misuse of the data did not result in any harm when it was publicly reported.

Alito, Jr.\n        Opening Statement: <speaker>Kevin K. Russell</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start by making clear our position. First, as to the actual question presented, we agree that a risk disclosure is not misleading because it omits disclosure of an event that is immaterial because it risks no  business harm. The Ninth Circuit did not hold otherwise. Second, we agree that in addition to proving materiality, plaintiffs must also show  that the risk statement implies that the omitted event did not occur. We don't claim that every risk statement includes that implication. Our position is simply that they can and frequently do, and that ultimately depends on the facts and context of each case. Third, for that reason, the Court should reject Facebook's categorical rule that Item 105 statements are always agnostic about whether the risk has transpired in the past. Facebook admits that if a student tells his parents that there's a risk he may fail an exam when he's already done so, that is misleading because it implies it's impossible that he won't when that isn't true. The same is true of many risk factor statements, including the ones at issue in this case stating that the  -- describing an improper disclosure of user data as a hypothetical risk implied that it was possible it wouldn't occur. And that wasn't  possible because it already had. This does not mean that issuers must disclose every material occurrence of a risk. They simply must say enough to remove the false impression that the omitted event has not yet materialized, something they generally can do, as Facebook did here with respect to hacking, by simply acknowledging that the risk has materialized in the past. Finally, the Ninth Circuit did not adopt any contrary categorical rule. The Court did not discuss whether these particular statements were agnostic about the past because Facebook never argued that they were. It elected instead to argue only that the warned-of risks had not transpired because it viewed the warned -of risks as speaking only to hacking events and business harm. Because Facebook does not challenge the Ninth Circuit's fact-bound rejection of those claims in this Court, this Court should provide any necessary guidance for future cases in the course of affirming the judgment.

Reading 1983 to preempt such laws would raise serious constitutional questions that are best avoided. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>\n\n        ### Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nA list of questions that Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. is likely to ask:\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So you think that the state could have a rule that says that if you have a claim against a state official, you have to go to a state agency and then the agency can say, well, we're going to take two years to decide this?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And then, if the agency says, we're not going to do anything about it, you have to go to the state supreme court and then the state supreme court can take two more years and then, if you're still unhappy, you can go to federal court?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  You think that that's okay?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  I mean, the idea is that there's some kind of a time limit, isn't that right?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So what is the time limit?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I mean, that's a pretty long time. I mean, that's a long time. It's longer than the time that it takes to go through the entire federal process.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So you're saying that's okay?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So, if you have a claim against a state official and you go to the state agency and they say, well, we're going to take two years to decide this, you can go to federal court, right?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Okay. So the rule that you're defending is the rule that was applied here, right?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And you're saying that that rule is okay?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Okay. All right. Now, if that rule is okay, what would be wrong with the rule that I described?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So what's the difference?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  I don't understand that.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So you're saying that the state agency can take two years to decide this, but, if it takes two years, you can go to federal court?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So you're saying that's okay?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Okay. So, if that's okay, why isn't it okay for the state to say, you know, we're going to take two years to decide this, but you can't go to federal court until we've finished?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  But you just said that's okay.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  But you just said that's okay.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Justice Samuel A.

Alito, Jr. is likely to ask:\n<START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  The FLSA is a remedial statute, and so the question is, what is the remedy that Congress had in mind? And, in the case of an individual who is entitled to back wages, it's not a question of the government taking away something that the person has. It's a question of the government giving something to the person, namely, the back wages. So why isn't that a case where clear and convincing evidence is appropriate?</START_Q>\n<START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I'm not talking about the government taking away something that the person has. I'm talking about the government giving something to the person. And, in the case of the government giving something to the person, isn't the question, what is the remedy that Congress had in mind? And, in this case, the remedy is a payment of back wages. And so, if you have a case where you have a person who is entitled to back wages, isn't it a question of the government giving that person something, rather than the government taking something away from the person?</START_Q>\n<START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I mean, you -- you can look at it that way, but, if you look at it that way, then you have to ask the question, what is the remedy that Congress had in mind? And, in this case, the remedy is the payment of back wages. And so it's a question of the government giving something to the person, not the government taking away something that the person has.</START_Q>\n<START_Q> Justice Samuel A.

The FCA protects government funds by defining a claim as a request for money the government provides or that's presented to a government agent. As a result of political branch choices, E-rate reimbursement requests check neither box. The program could have been funded with public money and administered by a government agency, but the political branches chose private funding and a private administrator to prevent E-rate money from being used to mask budget shortfalls and to avoid the Government Corporation Control Act. The consequence of those choices is that E-rate reimbursement requests aren't FCA claims. First, the government doesn't provide any money in the E-rate program. Text, context, structure, and history all confirm that the government provides money for FCA purposes only if it supplies money from its own funds, putting  the public fisc at risk. That never happened here. The government doesn't provide money by making one private party pay another private party, and the government doesn't provide money by collecting debts owed to a private party and in which the government has no financial stake. Second, the program's private administrator, the Administrative Company, isn't a government agent. By design, it lacks power to bind the government, which in turn lacks control over what matters here:  grants of E-rate reimbursement requests.

Alito, Jr.\n        Opening Statement: <speaker>Allyson N. Ho</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The False Claims Act, which casts its shadow over every aspect of the administrative state, has always been trained on guarding the public fisc. The FCA protects government funds by defining a claim as a request for money the government provides or that's presented to a government agent. As a result of political branch choices, E-rate reimbursement requests check neither box. The program could have been funded with public money and administered by a government agency, but the political branches chose private funding and a private administrator to prevent E-rate money from being used to mask budget shortfalls and to avoid the Government Corporation Control Act. The consequence of those choices is that E-rate reimbursement requests aren't FCA claims. First, the government doesn't provide any money in the E-rate program. Text, context, structure, and history all confirm that the government provides money for FCA purposes only if it supplies money from its own funds, putting  the public fisc at risk. That never happened here. The government doesn't provide money by making one private party pay another private party, and the government doesn't provide money by collecting debts owed to a private party and in which the government has no financial stake. Second, the program's private administrator, the Administrative Company, isn't a government agent. By design, it lacks power to bind the government, which in turn lacks control over what matters here:  grants of E-rate reimbursement requests. In fact, we know the company can't be a government agent because, if it were, it would violate the Government Corporation Control Act. Choices have consequences, and the choices made by the political branches to insulate the E-rate program from the public fisc foreclose applying the FCA.

So, when the administrator paid Wisconsin Bell, that was the government providing money through its agent. Indeed, many government programs, including most notably Medicare, use private claims administrators to provide billions of dollars to beneficiaries of government programs. As Justice Kagan's soup hypothetical, Justice Barrett's proctor hypothetical illustrate, when an entity like the government provides money through agents, we credit the principal in that situation. So, when Wisconsin Bell  receives money, claims money, from the E-rate program, we credit the government with providing it. FCC mandates also  determine carriers' obligations to contribute to the Universal Service Fund. Those mandates are how the government provided funds to this program, and  it doesn't matter that the government routed the funds directly from the carriers to the  Universal Service Fund instead of requiring an unnecessary detour through federal Treasury accounts because the False Claims Act's applicability doesn't turn on bookkeeping conventions, which is also a point Ms. Ho made, I think, quite well. The point is not exactly how did the money move through a bureaucracy, was it routed efficiently or less efficiently. The point is who is really making the money move, and it is the government. The government is the only relevant decision-maker at all stages of creating, funding, and then controlling the distributions from this program. The administrator merely does what the government wants. Under the plain meaning of the word \"provide,\" the government therefore provides the money Wisconsin Bell claims. That's true of all the money and especially the hundred million  that was discussed more -- earlier. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>\n\n        ### Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nA list of questions that Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. is likely to ask:\n<START_Q> Mr. Singh, this is the first time that the government has come in and said that it is providing the money. What is the explanation for that?</END_Q>\n<START_Q> Well, I -- I don't know that that's the first time. I think that the government has long taken the position that the money is provided by the government, and I think that's also reflected in the statutory language that the government is responsible for providing the money. But I think, Justice Alito, you're getting at the question of why the government has taken the position that it has. And I think the reason for that is that it's -- it's -- it's very clear from the text and the statutory language that the government is providing the money here. And so the government has taken the position that it has, and we think that's the correct position.</END_Q>\n<START_Q> Well, if you're right about that, then the government has been -- has been paying out millions and millions of dollars in the past that it should not have paid out. Is that your position?</END_Q>\n<START_Q> No, Justice Alito. And, you know, I think, you know, the government is not the only one that has taken the position that the money is provided by the government. I think, you know, the FCC has also taken that position. It's also the position that was taken by the court of appeals in the case that's before the Court now. And, you know, the reason why the government has taken the position that it has is that the statutory language is clear. And I think that's what's important here, is that the statutory language is clear, and it says that the government is responsible for providing the money. And I think that's what's important here. And I think that's why the government has taken the position that it has.</END_Q>\n<START_Q> Well, it's -- it's not just the government. It's not just the government. It's the FCC, it's the courts, it's the carriers, everybody has taken the position that the carriers are the ones that are providing the money. And, if you're right, that's all been a mistake. And the government has been paying out millions and millions of dollars that it should not have paid out. Is that your position?</END_Q>\n<START_Q> Justice Alito, I don't think that's the position. And I think that's not the position because, you know, the government has taken the position that it has, and the government has been paying out the money. And I think that's what's important here. And I think that's why the government has taken the position that it has. And I think that's why the court of appeals took the position that it did. And I think that's why the FCC has taken the position that it has. I think that's what's important here.</END_Q>\n<START_Q> Well, you -- you seem to be saying that it doesn't make any difference what the carriers thought they were doing when they were paying this money. It doesn't make any difference what the FCC thought it was doing when it was assessing this money. It doesn't make any difference what the courts thought they were doing when they were interpreting this statute. It doesn't make any difference what the government thought it was doing when it was paying out this money. Is that your position?</END_Q>\n<START_Q> Justice Alito, I don't think that's the position. I think the position is that the statutory language is clear. And I think that's what's important here. And I think that's why the government has taken the position that it has. And I think that's why the court of appeals took the position that it did. And I think that's why the FCC has taken the position that it has. And I think that's what's important here.</END_Q>\n<START_Q> Well, if you're right, then there are two different programs. There's the program that everybody thought they were operating, and then there's the program that you think you are operating. Is that your position?</END_Q>\n<START_Q> No, Justice Alito. I think the statutory language is clear, and I think that's what's important here. And I think that's why the government has taken the position that it has. And I think that's why the court of appeals took the position that it did. And I think that's why the FCC has taken the position that it has. And I think that's what's important here.</END_Q>\n<START_Q> Well, if you're right, then there are two different programs.

The water quality standards are not the limitations themselves. Instead, they set the goals for the water body. EPA must translate those goals into discharge limitations. The Generic Prohibitions fail this task. As Judge Collins explained below, the Generic Prohibitions erase the distinction between water quality standards and discharge limitations, making them one and the same. The Generic Prohibitions revive the very \"cause or contribute\" standard Congress repealed. And they do not function as discharge limitations. As the Second Circuit recognized, they add nothing that tells a permitholder how  to control its discharges. EPA claims it uses the Generic Prohibitions as a backstop, an insurance policy against changing circumstances. But the Clean  Water Act already gives EPA all the tools it needs to address uncertainty. EPA can reopen, modify, or terminate a permit when conditions change, and it can exercise its statutory authority to protect public welfare in emergencies. What EPA cannot do is expose permitholders to liability based on receiving water conditions it cannot control. The Generic Prohibitions are also inconsistent with the Act's permit shield. The shield protects permitholders from liability as long as they comply with their permit terms. But, by imposing indeterminate requirements, the Generic Prohibitions prevent permitholders from relying on the shield's protections. San Francisco is therefore exposed to crushing criminal and civil penalties even when it otherwise complies with its 300-page permit.

Alito, Jr. is likely to ask:\n<START_Q>Ms. Steeley, you -- you have a lot of arguments. You're saying that this is not an effluent limitation. You're saying it's too vague. You're saying it's inconsistent with the permit shield. You're saying that the EPA has the authority to do something else. But, if we were to rule in your favor, what would be the consequence? What would happen? What would be the effect on the environment? Would there be a significant adverse effect on the environment?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, Your Honor, I think the first thing that would happen is that the EPA would have to go back and do the work that Congress told it to do, which is to set effluent limitations that are necessary to meet and implement water quality standards. And it could do that in a number of ways. It could do it through permits, it could do it through rulemaking, it could do it through standards of performance, but it would have to set those limits in a way that's consistent with the statute. And, you know, the EPA has done this work before. It's done it successfully. It's done it in the context of the Clean Water Act, it's done it in the context of the Clean Air Act. It's done it in the context of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. And so it could do it here. It could do it through a combination of those tools, and it could do it in a way that's consistent with the statute and consistent with the Constitution.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, you're saying it could do it, but what would be the consequence? Would there be a significant adverse effect on the environment?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, Your Honor, I think the -- the consequence would be that the EPA would have to do the work that Congress told it to do. And, you know, I think, if you look at the statute, the statute gives the EPA a lot of tools to address the uncertainty that it's concerned about. So, for example, it could reopen, modify, or terminate a permit. It could exercise its statutory authority to protect public welfare in emergencies. It could do that through rulemaking. It could do that through standards of performance. It could do it through permits. And it could do it in a way that's consistent with the statute and consistent with the Constitution. So I think that's the consequence that would follow from a ruling in our favor.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, you know, it's -- it's -- it's -- it's -- it's hard to figure out exactly what you're saying, but it seems to me that what you're saying is that this is a very significant case, that it's a very important case, and that if we were to rule in your favor, it would have a significant effect on the environment. Is that what you're saying?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>No, Your Honor. I think, if you look at the statute, the statute gives the EPA all the tools it needs to address uncertainty. And so I think that the consequence of a ruling in our favor would be that the EPA would have to do the work that Congress told it to do. It would have to set effluent limitations that are necessary to meet and implement water quality standards. And it could do that in a way that's consistent with the statute and consistent with the Constitution.

It would have to set effluent limitations that are necessary to meet and implement water quality standards. And it could do that in a way that's consistent with the statute and consistent with the Constitution.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, you know, you're not answering my question. I'm asking you, what would be the consequence?

And I think that the EPA has all the tools it needs to address the uncertainty that it's concerned about.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I mean, you know, this is a very important case. It's a very significant case. It's a very important case. And I'm trying to figure out what the consequence would be, and you're not answering my question. So I'm going to ask you one more time. Would there be a significant adverse effect on the environment if we were to rule in your favor?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, Your Honor, I think that the EPA has all the tools it needs to address the uncertainty that it's concerned about.

And Congress expressly provided otherwise in 1447.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, the -- the statute -- the statute that we're dealing with here, 1447, refers to original jurisdiction. And the original jurisdiction is jurisdiction over the claim that was asserted in the state court, right?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, Your Honor, I think that the -- the -- the original jurisdiction that the statute refers to is the original jurisdiction that the district court has over the case. And that's how this Court has interpreted it in St. Paul Mercury and in Carnegie Mellon.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, let's assume that the -- that the -- the claim that was asserted in state court was not within the original jurisdiction of the federal court. Then the federal court has no jurisdiction over that claim, right?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>That's correct, Your Honor.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>And then the question is, does the federal court have jurisdiction over the supplemental claims?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>That's correct, Your Honor.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>And the answer to that question is yes, right?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>That's correct, Your Honor.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>So the federal court has jurisdiction over the supplemental claims, but not over the original claim?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>That's correct, Your Honor.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, how can that be? I mean, what is the original jurisdiction that the federal court has in that situation?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, Your Honor, I think that the original jurisdiction that the district court has in that situation is the original jurisdiction that it has over the case, which is the supplemental claims. And I think that's how this Court has interpreted it in St. Paul Mercury and in Carnegie Mellon. And I think that the text of Section 1367 is clear on that point.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, the text of 1367, the text of 1367 refers to original jurisdiction, and it says that if the court has original jurisdiction, then it has supplemental jurisdiction. So the original jurisdiction refers to the claim that was asserted in state court, right?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>No, Your Honor. I think the original jurisdiction that it refers to is the original jurisdiction that the district court has over the case, which is the supplemental claims.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, if the federal court has no jurisdiction over the original claim, then the federal court has no jurisdiction over the case, right?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, Your Honor, I think that the district court has jurisdiction over the case, which is the supplemental claims. And I think that's the original jurisdiction that it refers to in Section 1367.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, if you -- if you're saying that the federal court has no jurisdiction over the original claim, then it has no jurisdiction over the case, right?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, Your Honor, I think that the district court has jurisdiction over the case, which is the supplemental claims. And I think that's the original jurisdiction that it refers to in Section 1367.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, how can that be? I mean, what is the original jurisdiction that the federal court has if it has no jurisdiction over the original claim?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, Your Honor, I think that the original jurisdiction that it refers to in Section 1367 is the original jurisdiction that it has over the supplemental claims.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, if the federal court has no jurisdiction over the original claim, then it has no jurisdiction over the case, right?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, Your Honor, I think that the district court has jurisdiction over the case, which is the supplemental claims. And I think that's the original jurisdiction that it refers to in Section 1367.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, if you say that the federal court has no jurisdiction over the original claim, then it has no jurisdiction over the case, right?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, Your Honor, I think that the district court has jurisdiction over the case, which is the supplemental claims.

Alito, Jr. is likely to ask:\n<START_Q>Ms. Keller, you say that the Eighth Circuit should be affirmed, but that's not the only way to affirm. And I think you have to argue that the Eighth Circuit was correct on the merits. And, if that's the case, then I don't understand your argument. If the Eighth Circuit was correct on the merits, then the case was properly removed to federal court and it was properly in federal court. And then, if the federal claims are dismissed, then, under 1367, the state law claims can remain. So what's the problem?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, Justice Alito, the problem is that this is a case where the federal issue was never properly in federal court, and so the federal issue was never properly in the action. And so, when it gets dismissed, there's nothing left in the action, and the case must be dismissed.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, but the federal issue was in federal court because it was properly removed, and the state law claims were properly in federal court because they were properly removed.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think that that's the -- that's the question, Justice Alito, whether they were properly removed. And I think that the text of 1441 tells us that they were not. And the reason is that 1441 says that the federal issue must be in the action, and the federal issue was not in the action because it was never properly in federal court. It was never properly in federal court because it was never properly in state court, and it was never properly in state court because it was never properly in the action. And so, if we look at the text of 1441, we see that it requires the federal issue to be in the action. And so, if the federal issue is not in the action, then the case was not properly removed. And, if the case was not properly removed, then the case must be dismissed.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, but the federal issue was in the action because it was properly removed. And the state law claims were properly in the action because they were properly removed.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think, Justice Alito, that that's -- that that's the question, and that's the question that we're asking the Court to resolve. And I think that the text of 1441 tells us that the federal issue was not properly in the action. And so, if we look at the text of 1441, it says that the federal issue must be in the action. And so, if the federal issue is not in the action, then the case was not properly removed. And, if the case was not properly removed, then the case must be dismissed. And I think that that's what the text of 1441 tells us, and that's what the text of 1367 tells us as well.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I'm not sure I understand your argument. You say that the federal issue was never properly in the action because it was never properly in federal court, and it was never properly in federal court because it was never properly in state court. But why was it not properly in state court?  It was properly in state court because it was properly removed. So that's the argument.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think that that's the question, Justice Alito, and that's the question that we're asking the Court to resolve. And I think that the text of 1441 tells us that the federal issue was not properly in the action. And so, if we look at the text of 1441, it says that the federal issue must be in the action. And so, if the federal issue is not in the action, then the case was not properly removed. And, if the case was not properly removed, then the case must be dismissed. And I think that that's what the text of 1441 tells us, and that's what the text of 1367 tells us as well.</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, what is the problem with the -- with the argument that I've just outlined?</END_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think that the problem with the argument that you've just outlined, Justice Alito, is that it ignores the text of 1441.

In context, that requirement applies not just to the day of approval but to the next day as well. In other words, the petition cannot remain approved if the agency reconsiders its initial decision and concludes that there was a sham marriage. That's because an approved visa petition confers no substantive benefits. It is simply a piece of paper signifying that a beneficiary is eligible to apply for a green card. If Congress believed you shouldn't get that piece of paper saying that you're eligible when you've been in a sham marriage, then -- then the agency has to take it away when it determines that you're not, in fact, eligible. That resolves this case. Because the revocation here was non-discretionary, it is reviewable. The government seeks to shield  itself from judicial review by claiming it has discretion to not revoke the petition even after a sham -marriage finding. Yet it identifies no circumstance in which it has ever or would ever exercise that purported discretion. Nor does it explain what purpose such discretion could serve if, as the government appears to believe, it's not actually allowed to give the beneficiary a green card. The discretion appears to simply be the discretion to allow a person to hold on to a now meaningless piece of paper that has been drained of all of its value. That cannot be the kind  of discretion that Congress sought to protect. The government's view also layers one anomaly on top of another. Most significantly, it creates a disparity in review between an initial decision and a reconsideration of that same decision based on the same criteria. And the government concedes that a person could obtain review if they filed a new -- a new petition and had it denied. But that gives the game away.

Alito, Jr. is likely to ask:\n<START_Q>Ms. Sinzdak, I -- I -- I -- I'm not sure I understand your answer to my question, but I'll ask another one. Suppose that -- that the -- the -- the agency -- the Secretary makes a determination that a marriage is a sham, and then the Secretary decides not to revoke the petition. Is that reviewable?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, it's not reviewable under 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), but it is reviewable under 1252(a)(2)(D), and so, in that circumstance, the agency would have to give a reason for not revoking the petition, and the reason would be subject to review under 1252(a)(2)(D).</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, what if the agency says, well, we think that the marriage is a sham, but, you know, we -- we're not going to revoke the petition, but we're going to -- we're going to tell the couple that they can't live together in the same house?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think, in that circumstance, that would be a decision that would be subject to review under 1252(a)(2)(D) because it would be an action that's outside of the Secretary's discretionary authority.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, that's not discretionary?  I mean, you're saying that the Secretary has discretion to decide whether to revoke or not to revoke, but the Secretary doesn't have discretion to do anything else?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, the Secretary has discretion to do other things. The Secretary has discretion to investigate, for example. But, here, we're talking about the revocation decision itself, and that is the decision that Congress made discretionary in Section 1155, and that's the decision that's covered by the judicial review bar.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, if the Secretary has discretion to do things other than revoke, then why wouldn't the Secretary have discretion to revoke or not to revoke?  I mean, that's --</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think --</START_Q>\n<START_Q>That's -- that's -- that's the whole point.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think that the Secretary does have discretion to revoke or not to revoke. And the question is whether that discretion is subject to judicial review, and I think that the answer to that is no.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, why -- why is it discretionary to revoke or not to revoke but not discretionary to do other things?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think that it's discretionary to do other things as well. And so, for example, the Secretary can investigate a sham marriage. And the question is whether the Secretary's decision to do that is subject to judicial review. And, here, I think that the answer to that is no because the Secretary is acting pursuant to his discretionary authority.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, what if the Secretary decides to revoke the petition and says, we're revoking the petition because we think that the marriage is a sham, but we're going to give the couple a year to get a divorce?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, I think that that would be a decision that would be covered by the judicial review bar in 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) because that's a decision that's made pursuant to the Secretary's discretionary authority to revoke the petition.</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, but it's not a revocation.

Alito, Jr. is likely to ask:\n<START_Q>Ms. Sherry, I -- I understand your argument, but it's not that simple, is it, because the phrase \"entitled to benefits under SSI\" is not used in the statute. It's \"entitled to SSI benefits.\" And the statute also says that the Secretary shall make a determination of the number of patients who are entitled to SSI benefits. And it seems to me that the entitlement to SSI benefits is the entitlement to the cash benefit, not the entitlement to the other benefits that are available to SSI recipients. So, if you're right about the meaning of \"entitled to benefits under SSI,\" then why doesn't it also mean that the Secretary has to make a determination of the number of patients who are entitled to the other benefits that are available to SSI recipients?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>But, Ms. Sherry, you -- you -- you're not -- you're not suggesting that the hospital has to make an individual determination of the entitlement of each patient, are you?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, let's -- let's say that the hospital has a patient who is eligible for SSI, but the patient has not applied for SSI. Is that person entitled to SSI benefits?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>And the same thing would be true if the patient is eligible for SSI but the patient has applied for SSI and the application is pending, correct?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>And the same thing would be true if the patient has applied for SSI and the application has been denied, but the patient is appealing the denial, correct?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>And, presumably, the same thing would be true if the patient has been denied SSI benefits, but the patient is seeking a rehearing, correct?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>And, presumably, the same thing would be true if the patient has been denied SSI benefits, the patient has sought a rehearing, and the rehearing has been denied, but the patient is seeking judicial review, correct?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>And, presumably, the same thing would be true if the patient has been denied SSI benefits, the patient has sought a rehearing, the rehearing has been denied, the patient has sought judicial review, and the judicial review has been denied, but the patient is seeking review by a court of appeals, correct?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>So that the -- the patient who is entitled to SSI benefits is not the patient who has actually received the SSI benefit, but the patient who would be eligible for the SSI benefit if the patient applied for it and if the patient's application were granted, correct?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, let's say that the patient is eligible for SSI, but the patient has not applied for SSI because the patient has been in the hospital for a long time, and the patient's application for SSI is pending, and the patient is waiting for the result of the application. Is that patient entitled to SSI benefits?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, let's say that the patient has applied for SSI, the patient is eligible for SSI, but the patient has not received the SSI benefit because the patient is in the hospital and the patient has not been able to get the check. Is that patient entitled to SSI benefits?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>And, presumably, the same thing would be true if the patient has applied for SSI, the patient is eligible for SSI, the patient has received the SSI benefit, but the patient has not been able to cash the check because the patient is in the hospital, correct?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, let's say that the patient has applied for SSI, the patient is eligible for SSI, the patient has received the SSI benefit, the patient has cashed the check, but the patient has not been able to spend the money because the patient is in the hospital. Is that patient entitled to SSI benefits?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, let's say that the patient has applied for SSI, the patient is eligible for SSI, the patient has received the SSI benefit, the patient has cashed the check, the patient has spent the money, but the patient is still in the hospital. Is that patient entitled to SSI benefits?</START_Q>\n<START_Q>Well, let's say that the patient has applied for SSI, the patient is eligible for SSI, the patient has received the SSI benefit, the patient has cashed the check, the patient has spent the money, the patient has been discharged from the hospital, but the patient has not been able to get a job because the patient is disabled.

And in the Medicare fraction, Congress used a patient's entitlement to SSI benefits as a proxy for determining whether the patient is low income. SSI benefits are monthly cash payments made by SSA when a person meets eligibility requirements in a particular month, including the requirement of having low income in that month. Thus, as HHS has consistently recognized since Congress enacted the Medicare fraction, a person is entitled to SSI benefits only when he satisfies the requirements for a cash payment during the month of his hospital stay. That interpretation is fully consistent with the one this Court upheld in Empire Health. The Medica re fraction uses two distinct phrases, \"entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A\" and \"entitled to SSI benefits under Title XVI.\"  And while the word \"entitled\" means the same thing within both phrases, benefits under Medicare Part A are fundamentally distinct from SSI benefits under Title XVI. Petitioners claim that a person is entitled to SSI benefits even if he is not owed a cash payment during the month of his hospital  stay so long as he received at least a single cash payment sometime within the year prior to his hospital stay. But SSI benefits are monthly cash paymen ts. So, if a person is not entitled to the cash payment in a particular month, he's simply not entitled to SSI benefits in that month. Petitioners also claim that SSI benefits under Title XVI include not only cash payments but also certain non-cash benefits. But those non-cash benefits are not supplemental security income benefits because they are not cash payments made by SSA, nor are they provided under Title XVI. Ultimately, Petitioners would routinely count patients as low income even though they are earning too much income to be entitled to an SSI benefit.

It takes due account of the Secretary's application of it, and it does so in making the determinations under subsection (a). Those textual clues point to standard principles of judicial review of agency action. That is, the Veterans Cour t reviews legal aspects of the Secretary's application of 5107(b) de novo and factual aspects deferentially, here, for clear error. The Secretary's determination that all the evidence in the record on a particular issue is or is not an approximate balance is itself factual or predominantly factual and  so should be reviewed for clear error.

And so that leaves subsection (b)(1) with no additional work to do. But, when Congress enacted (b)(1) in 2002, it took what was implicit or just generally covered in (a) and made it explicit and specific. It put an exclamation point on it. That's not nothing. Think of the Tenth Amendment, for example. But, even if you think that our interpretation renders (b)(1) largely redundant, it's still better than the alternative that Petitioners offer you. Petitioners say that the approximate balance finding should be reviewed de novo. But  that creates needless contradictions in the text. It conflicts with the express standard of review Congress supplied in (a)(4). It's in  serious tension with the prohibition on trial de novo in subsection (c). It's a real divergence from standard principles of judicial review generally and judicial review of agency decisions more specifically. And it's even inconsistent with the way other factual issues under (b)(1) are reviewed, as my friend mentioned this morning, like the in-service connection or existence of a disability. If Congress intended that highly irregular result, I think the language in (b)(1) is an awfully cryptic way of going about it. So, as between two interpretations, one that's sort of consistent, coherent, with a little bit of redundancy, and one that eliminates the redundancy at the cost of a statute at war with itself, I think you should pick the former over the latter.
