Mr. Keisler's second argument in his brief, which is his lead argument today, the argument that the extension, the word \"extension\" is temporal but does not have to be continuous, just to set up how I'm thinking about this and then get your response, you know, you -- you admit it's not an unambiguous word. I think Congress uses \"extension\" sometimes even when something's lapsed. We have the examples -- COVID and other examples. You make a big deal about ordinary usage, but I'll give you three instances in my life where ordinary usage goes the other way from what you -- what you say. So sometimes one that you're teaching and you have a 5:00 p.m. due date for a paper, you know, after the due date, you will get an e-mail entitled Extension Request, you grant a paper extension afterwards. Or when a -- you use a sports contract example in your brief, but oftentimes, if the contract ends at the end of the season, in the off-season, the player signs a new contract. That will be described by most people as player extends for two more years. Or, if you let your print newspaper subscription lapse for a time and then you start it up again, you'll tell your family member or friend, oh, I extended the paper subscription. So I -- I think ordinary usage also, like congressional usage, in my experience at least doesn't tell us exactly. So how do we break this? And the two things he emphasizes are \"at any time\" and that that's -- there's no sunset date. So I want to get your responses to that. And then also on the purpose and context, if we get to that, to help break what -- I don't want to say tie, but to figure out what Congress was thinking about with the word or what it was doing with the word \"extension,\" your position is that Congress wanted small fine -- refineries to have no outlet at all, to essentially go out of business, whereas the other side's position is simply that EPA would have authority, as a matter of separation of powers, authority to grant an exemption if a small refinery had -- had a -- had a problem, and it really seems quite implausible to think Congress wanted refineries in that circumstance to go out of business. So, if I can get your response on the \"at any time,\" no sunset date, and the implausibility of Congress wanting small refineries to go out of business rather than EPA having authority.</turn>\n<turn>Christopher G. Michel: Thanks, Justice Kavanaugh. And I think I can maybe fold in a little bit of your first question too or your comment. You know, I think \"at any time\" means exactly what it says, which is that a small refinery can ask for an extension of the exemption at any time, but that doesn't define what an extension of the exemption is. So, in Justice Kagan's example, I think, if that renter originally had a lease that said you can extend your lease at any time, I don't think it would work to come back five years later and ask for an extension. I think, as my friend said, the landlord would still scratch his or her head. So I think, although I take your point that --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M.

I said before, and I think Justice Kavanaugh is right to be more precise about this, so this is kind of a random crime, but it's random because of the facts of the case and it was a misdemeanor. So, you know, jaywalking, the example in Nieves for the exception, I mean, jaywalking, I think everybody agrees that absent some circumstance, you know, where you endangered someone or darted in front of a car, jaywalking is not serious. Does it matter at all?  I mean, do we look at the facts?  Do we look at the crime?

I don't think it necessarily matters what crime or what level of seriousness of crime was listed on  the warrant or was listed on, you know, the officer's notes. So I do think it's a  conduct-based comparison. I don't think the Court needs to address the seriousness question here necessarily because this is a misdemeanor crime, but we would have no objection to the Court drawing a felony/misdemeanor distinction and just saying that Nieves doesn't apply outside of that, and I think that's because -- and that could be appropriate because Nieves did seem to be concerned about endemic crimes that are infrequently prosecuted, where there's a large amount of discretion. And from the federal government's perspective, where we see the most types of problematic and potentially retaliatory arrests are in situations like unlawful assembly, blocking a sidewalk, disorderly conduct, trespassing on government property, and those things tend to be low-level endemic offenses where there's a lot of discretion.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  That's true, although the line between misdemeanor and felony is drawn in different places in different jurisdictions, and it would be pretty hard, I think, to -- to hold that as a consistent line.

The first is Congress's use of the phrase \"impose a reduced sentence.\" We think that that's a clear textual indication that what Congress wanted courts to do is to apply the Section 3553(a) factors, the factors that courts consider when they impose a sentence more generally. And many of those factors incorporate consideration of intervening legal and factual developments because they go to things like the history and characteristics of the defendant and the severity of the defense -- of the offense. The alternative textual basis we would say for the \"must consider\" rule is that Section 404 clearly sets up a statutory scheme where district courts are supposed to exercise their discretion. And in the sentencing context, courts, of course, must be reasonable in exercising their discretion, and the way that Congress has established for courts to be reasonable is to apply the 3553(a) factors.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Clarence Thomas: Don't -- do you think that your discretionary or \"may\" permissive argument is a better -- stronger argument than the \"mandatory\" argument?</turn>\n<turn>Charles L.

I guess the one advantage I would say that the \"must consider\" argument has is that we think it would be more predictable for district courts because the parties will know that the court is going to pay attention to arguments about intervening developments. And I think the same is probably true for appellate courts. They will have the hook of the 3553(a) factors when they review the case. But just to be clear, Your Honor, we would be perfectly happy with an opinion that said courts may consider these developments. That's certainly better than the First Circuit's rule.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Clarence Thomas: Thank you.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: I don't really understand, either through your presentation or the government's, what this \"may\" argument is.

Judge -- judges now do that all the time. And I understand the argument that you can't look at the things and change it, but what is -- what is the \"may\"? You've already got the \"may\" in the \"must\" part. You have to consider it, but you don't have to do anything. It -- it sounds to me like we're delegating to -- or Congress or somebody's delegating to individual district judges the authority to determine what the law is. It's like a police officer -- you know, you can't park here or you pay -- you have to pay, you know, $20. You know, it's one thing to say, yeah, the officer can say, you know, I'm not going to give you a ticket, I see you're coming down the street or whatever it is. Doesn't have to, you know, enforce whatever discretion he has. But the officer can't say I think people ought to be able to park here, so I'm never going to give anybody a ticket for that. What is -- what is this \"may\" argument?</turn>\n<turn>Charles L. McCloud: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think it stems from the fact that Congress clearly has set up a discretionary scheme in this statute. Courts have discretion to decide whether to impose a reduced sentence or not. And so, when they're making that decision, we don't see anything in the text of the statute or in sentencing practice more generally that would suggest that courts are required to put certain information off limits.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, right, but what you're saying is Congress passed this discretionary rule, but the people in this \"may\" category are saying I'm not going to exercise my discretion, I am never going to give a -- a reduction to the sentence. Is that all right? That's -- that's -- I don't think that would be something that we would accept in any other area of the law where people have discretion. You would say, yes, in this particular case, you don't have to give a discretion -- an adjustment. You have discretion not to do that. But the idea for somebody to decide I -- I am not going to exercise discretion, I'm just not going to look at it, I don't understand what -- where that authority comes from.</turn>\n<turn>Charles L.

And I think the same is probably true for appellate courts. They will have the hook of the 3553(a) factors when they review the case. But just to be clear, Your Honor, we would be perfectly happy with an opinion that said courts may consider these developments. That's certainly better than the First Circuit's rule.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Clarence Thomas: Thank you.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: I don't really understand, either through your presentation or the government's, what this \"may\" argument is. I understand the idea that you must consider the different things, and at the end of the day, you can come out and say, well, I'm not going to change anything. Judge -- judges now do that all the time. And I understand the argument that you can't look at the things and change it, but what is -- what is the \"may\"? You've already got the \"may\" in the \"must\" part. You have to consider it, but you don't have to do anything. It -- it sounds to me like we're delegating to -- or Congress or somebody's delegating to individual district judges the authority to determine what the law is. It's like a police officer -- you know, you can't park here or you pay -- you have to pay, you know, $20. You know, it's one thing to say, yeah, the officer can say, you know, I'm not going to give you a ticket, I see you're coming down the street or whatever it is. Doesn't have to, you know, enforce whatever discretion he has. But the officer can't say I think people ought to be able to park here, so I'm never going to give anybody a ticket for that. What is -- what is this \"may\" argument?</turn>\n<turn>Charles L. McCloud: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think it stems from the fact that Congress clearly has set up a discretionary scheme in this statute. Courts have discretion to decide whether to impose a reduced sentence or not. And so, when they're making that decision, we don't see anything in the text of the statute or in sentencing practice more generally that would suggest that courts are required to put certain information off limits.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, right, but what you're saying is Congress passed this discretionary rule, but the people in this \"may\" category are saying I'm not going to exercise my discretion, I am never going to give a -- a reduction to the sentence. Is that all right? That's -- that's -- I don't think that would be something that we would accept in any other area of the law where people have discretion. You would say, yes, in this particular case, you don't have to give a discretion -- an adjustment. You have discretion not to do that. But the idea for somebody to decide I -- I am not going to exercise discretion, I'm just not going to look at it, I don't understand what -- where that authority comes from.</turn>\n<turn>Charles L. McCloud: So, Mr. Chief Justice, I would agree with you that district courts do not have that authority. I think that courts could not erect categorical rules that they would never look at intervening developments or that they would never reduce a sentence under the First Step Act. I think it has to be an individualized defendant-by-defendant determination that may --</turn>\n</context>\n<justice>Justice Neil Gorsuch</justice>\nGenerate a question that Justice Neil Gorsuch is likely to ask next.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch: Counsel, I'm not sure I understood your answer to the Chief Justice.

But the reading that you have suggested assumes that Congress didn't know what it was... the scope of the prohibition it enacted in Section 717(a) and was effectively saying: Here are some remedies; we don't know whether they apply or not, but if they do, go ahead and use them. And I submit that is an improper assumption about congressional understanding of its own legislation. The proper assumption is that Congress understood 717(a) to bar retaliation. That's why it provided a retaliation remedy, and that assumption is buttressed by the fact that, as this Court explained in the Brown v. GSA case, Congress adopted Title VII precisely because it found that fear of reprisal had made the old scheme ineffective. So it makes perfect sense that it would want to prohibit retaliation under Title VII in the Federal sector because reprisals had rendered the old protections useless.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: --Well, could you proceed with that? That is, a very simple way of thinking of this as one possible way of reading it is that Congress says: When private employers discriminate, there can be whistleblower's, and they need protection; so let's put some in. When State officials discriminate, say, on the basis of race, there can be some whistleblower's. Maybe they protect them in some States; maybe they don't protect them in others. We better put some in. When Federal Government officials discriminate against on the basis of race, whistleblower's should be protected. But we have a whole system here to protect them.

Roberts, Jr.: Justice Kavanaugh?</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Earlier, in response to Justice Jackson's question about the legislative history, you said you had four responses. You got out one and two about the Cherokee, Seminole, and then the placement does not equal membership. I was interested in what three and four are, if you remember the question.</turn>\n<turn>Matthew D. McGill: MR. McGILL: I think I do, Justice Kavanaugh. The third point is that the -- that the placement -- to the extent we're talking about tribal self-government, which is to say the ability of tribes to make their own laws, the ability under Williams, reservation Indians, to make their own laws and be ruled by them, the placement preferences do not even suggest that any Indian child has to live on or near a reservation. And the fourth point, which is the most fundamental point, which is that embedded in this argument is that tribes have a proprietary interest in these -- in these children. And they are human beings. They are citizens of the United States and the states in which they reside. They are persons within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. And they have liberty interests that the tribe cannot override simply by unilaterally enrolling them.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: On the equal protection issue, it'll be important for us to figure out the scope and limits of Mancari. And I'm going to ask two hypotheticals and then ask you to explain what I think will be your answer. So, one, would Mancari justify a hiring preference for American Indians in other agencies beyond the BIA, such as the Treasury Department or the Justice Department, for example, in your view?</turn>\n<turn>Matthew D. McGill: MR. McGILL: No, because, one, Mancari itself casts doubt on that possibility. And, two, there would be no tether to Indian self-government.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Second, would Mancari alone justify a federally mandated preference for state universities, college admissions for American Indians, in your view?</turn>\n<turn>Matthew D. McGill: MR. McGILL: No, Your Honor.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: And why not?</turn>\n<turn>Matthew D. McGill: MR. McGILL: Again, because it would have no tether to Indian self-government. I think part of the flaw of the -- you know, the arguments on the other side here is that it -- it reduces to anything that is good for Indians, that could be characterized in that way or that the government in its paternalistic judgment thinks might be good for Indians can be -- is permissible under their view.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Well, wouldn't that be good for Indian self-government in the sense of ensuring additional, better education for American Indians? Why wouldn't that justification link up with tribal self-government?</turn>\n<turn>Matthew D. McGill: MR. McGILL: It's too attenuated, Your Honor. Rice, I think, explains this.

So that provision requires the parties seeking to effect a foster care placement or termination of parental rights to satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitation programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family. And the government says, well, this applies to both private parties and state agencies. And so it's not directed at the state agencies in compelling government action, in compelling the state to take steps. How does this work?

So I think there's an aspect of your Article I argument that really boils down to a fundamental question that comes up in the law a lot, which is who decides. Who decides whether regulation in this area counts for Indian self-government, promotes Indian self-government, has a sufficient tether? I keep hearing you say in response to many of my colleagues' questions that you think that regulation related to family affairs does not have a sufficient connection to Indian self-government. But, in the actual legislative history of this -- of ICWA -- and I'm reading from the Federal Register -- Congress says that -- it indicates that ICWA reflects its \"concern about preserving the integrity of tribes as self-governing sovereign entities and ensuring that tribes could survive both culturally and politically.\" That's 81 Fed. Reg. -- Federal Register 38,781. So it seems to me that Congress has made a decision that regulating in this area is important for preserving the integrity of tribes as self-governing sovereign entities, and, therefore, I don't think it's sufficient for you to say to us that you think that that's not true.

Roberts, Jr.: Justice Kavanaugh?</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Earlier, in response to Justice Jackson's question about the legislative history, you said you had four responses. You got out one and two about the Cherokee, Seminole, and then the placement does not equal membership. I was interested in what three and four are, if you remember the question.</turn>\n<turn>Matthew D. McGill: MR. McGILL: I think I do, Justice Kavanaugh. The third point is that the -- that the placement -- to the extent we're talking about tribal self-government, which is to say the ability of tribes to make their own laws, the ability under Williams, reservation Indians, to make their own laws and be ruled by them, the placement preferences do not even suggest that any Indian child has to live on or near a reservation. And the fourth point, which is the most fundamental point, which is that embedded in this argument is that tribes have a proprietary interest in these -- in these children. And they are human beings. They are citizens of the United States and the states in which they reside. They are persons within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. And they have liberty interests that the tribe cannot override simply by unilaterally enrolling them.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: On the equal protection issue, it'll be important for us to figure out the scope and limits of Mancari. And I'm going to ask two hypotheticals and then ask you to explain what I think will be your answer. So, one, would Mancari justify a hiring preference for American Indians in other agencies beyond the BIA, such as the Treasury Department or the Justice Department, for example, in your view?</turn>\n<turn>Matthew D. McGill: MR. McGILL: No, because, one, Mancari itself casts doubt on that possibility. And, two, there would be no tether to Indian self-government.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Second, would Mancari alone justify a federally mandated preference for state universities, college admissions for American Indians, in your view?</turn>\n<turn>Matthew D. McGill: MR. McGILL: No, Your Honor.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: And why not?</turn>\n<turn>Matthew D. McGill: MR. McGILL: Again, because it would have no tether to Indian self-government. I think part of the flaw of the -- you know, the arguments on the other side here is that it -- it reduces to anything that is good for Indians, that could be characterized in that way or that the government in its paternalistic judgment thinks might be good for Indians can be -- is permissible under their view.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Well, wouldn't that be good for Indian self-government in the sense of ensuring additional, better education for American Indians? Why wouldn't that justification link up with tribal self-government?</turn>\n<turn>Matthew D. McGill: MR. McGILL: It's too attenuated, Your Honor. Rice, I think, explains this. Rice draws this line between regulation of the tribes' internal affairs and the use of tribal classifications there and the use of tribal classifications in the affairs of the state. In your hypothetical, we're talking about the affairs of the state. And I think that, you know, the important point about Rice is that there -- there -- in that case, there was a -- not just a plausible, a fairly direct tie to self-government of the indigenous people. But the Court said Mancari could not be extended to that new context because Mancari was a limited exception based on the \"sui generis\" role of the BIA in regulating Indian tribes.

How did it affect him? He was, right before the homicides, at the house of a friend in an erratic state, saying he had a message from God, brandishing a knife and putting it into the door.

Roberts, Jr.: We will hear argument first this morning in Case Number 21-869, Andy Warhol Foundation versus Goldsmith. Mr. Martinez.</turn>\n<turn>Roman Martinez: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Both courts below agreed and Goldsmith doesn't dispute that Warhol's Prince Series can reasonably be perceived to convey a fundamentally different meaning or message from Goldsmith's photograph. The question in this case is whether that different meaning or message should play a role, any role, in the fair use analysis. Our answer is yes. Warhol's transformative meaning puts points on the board under Factor 1 of the four-factor balancing test. Goldsmith and the Second Circuit say no. Warhol's new meaning is categorically irrelevant and can't be considered as part of Factor 1 or any other factor. I want to emphasize three points. First, the precedent supports us. Campbell unambiguously requires an examination of meaning or message. Google reaffirms that test and cites Warhol's Soup Cans as a paradigmatic example of when it's satisfied. Goldsmith's test is at odds with both cases. Second, our approach, unlike Goldsmith's, maintains a balance between protecting artists' rights to monetize their works and encouraging new and important follow-on expression. We give follow-on artists credit for innovation at Factor 1 while recognizing that Factor 4 and the other factors will sometimes cut decisively the other way. Goldsmith's necessity test, by contrast, upends that balance. It banishes transformative meaning from the equation altogether, and by doing so, it violates 107's text, contradicts precedent, and undermines copyright's key goal, promoting creativity for the public good. Finally, the stakes for artistic expression in this case are high. A ruling for Goldsmith would strip protection not just from the Prince Series but from countless works of modern and contemporary art. It would make it illegal for artists, museums, galleries, and collectors to display, sell, profit from, maybe even possess a significant quantity of works. It would also chill the creation of new art by established and up-and-coming artists alike. These results are repugnant to copyright and to the First Amendment. You should reject them. We ask you to reaffirm Campbell and reverse the decision below.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Clarence Thomas: Could you give us an example of any follow-on work that fails your test?</turn>\n<turn>Roman Martinez: Sure.

I think, if you -- if someone were to, you know, try to do that, I think that the -- the original creator, the author of the book, could very easily assert that that was not fair use and would have a winning case under Factor 4 and probably also under Factor 1. And, certainly, that would be a kind of classic example of a follow-on work that would not count.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Why? I mean, derivative works are generally in a different medium, and almost all of them, even a dramatization on -- on theater or even a motion picture or a sequel, they add something new according to your definition in your brief. So why shouldn't they be protected as well according to your theory?</turn>\n<turn>Roman Martinez: Yeah, I think -- I think there's a Factor 4 issue and a Factor 1 issue.

Campbell unambiguously requires an examination of meaning or message. Google reaffirms that test and cites Warhol's Soup Cans as a paradigmatic example of when it's satisfied. Goldsmith's test is at odds with both cases. Second, our approach, unlike Goldsmith's, maintains a balance between protecting artists' rights to monetize their works and encouraging new and important follow-on expression. We give follow-on artists credit for innovation at Factor 1 while recognizing that Factor 4 and the other factors will sometimes cut decisively the other way. Goldsmith's necessity test, by contrast, upends that balance. It banishes transformative meaning from the equation altogether, and by doing so, it violates 107's text, contradicts precedent, and undermines copyright's key goal, promoting creativity for the public good. Finally, the stakes for artistic expression in this case are high. A ruling for Goldsmith would strip protection not just from the Prince Series but from countless works of modern and contemporary art. It would make it illegal for artists, museums, galleries, and collectors to display, sell, profit from, maybe even possess a significant quantity of works. It would also chill the creation of new art by established and up-and-coming artists alike. These results are repugnant to copyright and to the First Amendment. You should reject them. We ask you to reaffirm Campbell and reverse the decision below.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Clarence Thomas: Could you give us an example of any follow-on work that fails your test?</turn>\n<turn>Roman Martinez: Sure. I think a classic example would be a -- a book-to-movie adaptation. I think that would be a follow-on work. It would be a derivative work. I think, if you -- if someone were to, you know, try to do that, I think that the -- the original creator, the author of the book, could very easily assert that that was not fair use and would have a winning case under Factor 4 and probably also under Factor 1. And, certainly, that would be a kind of classic example of a follow-on work that would not count.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Why? I mean, derivative works are generally in a different medium, and almost all of them, even a dramatization on -- on theater or even a motion picture or a sequel, they add something new according to your definition in your brief. So why shouldn't they be protected as well according to your theory?</turn>\n<turn>Roman Martinez: Yeah, I think -- I think there's a Factor 4 issue and a Factor 1 issue. I think the most obvious problem would be a Factor 4 problem for the person who's trying to copy or -- or create the movie adaptation.</turn>\n</context>\n<justice>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</justice>\nGenerate a question that Justice Sonia Sotomayor is likely to ask next.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor: Well, I don't know how you can have a Factor 4 problem if you're creating a different medium.

Do you want to say anything in response to this question? (Laughter.)</turn>\n<turn>Frederick R. Yarger: Justice Breyer, I understand what you're struggling with. We -- we struggle with it as well, but the -- the law in Colorado supported by decisions of this Court and others in the 1800s and early 1900s suggests that this is a question of whether the State has decided to provide this kind of compensation. And if the Court rules that this is a matter of substantive procedural -- or excuse me, substantive right under the Constitution, I think you do encounter very significant problems about why compensation isn't awarded for the serious deprivation of liberty that occurs --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Why does it -- why does it matter who owns this money at this time under Colorado law? This was the defendants' money and it was taken away from them. So if -- at -- you say that at some point it ceased to be their money and it became the state's money. But then you have to show that it was taken away pursuant to due process, and consistent with due process.</turn>\n<turn>Frederick R. Yarger: Yes, and the due process is, as -- as Petitioners admit, and they did so below in their petitions for rehearing to the Colorado supreme court. They said that the -- the depravations of their liberty and their property comported with due process because a conviction supported the imposition of costs, fees, and restitution. I believe my friend Mr. Banner said it again today, so that is the due process that lead to the deprivation.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, how can the conviction -- how -- how can the conviction have been reversed if -- if they were convicted consistent with due process?</turn>\n<turn>Frederick R. Yarger: Your Honor, there were errors -- there were errors in these trials, but the question is whether there was process sufficient to allow the conviction to attach, and certainly Petitioners don't argue otherwise. If there were defects sufficient enough that this was a wrongful deprivation of liberty, for example, like the Manuel v. City of Joliet case this Court encountered. There would be a claim for compensation due to a wrongful defect in the due process in the procedures that led to that deprivation. But the question here, there was no wrongful conduct that occurred, there was an error that occurred.

Breyer: You have a corporate criminal defendant, you can't put him in jail, and -- and so what they do is they fine the corporation $15 million. And then the State says, by the way, why appeal? If you win, we're not going to give you the money back as the Chief Justice said. We'll assert sovereign immunity. Now, there's something wrong with that. I'm trying to put my finger on it. (Laughter.)</turn>\n<turn>Frederick R. Yarger: Justice Breyer, if there's something wrong with that, then there was something wrong with those long -- the cases decided previously. And this is --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: Maybe they were right in 1832 and then they went off on a wrong track. (Laughter.)</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: Maybe those cases were wrong. I don't -- I don't know. I have to go read them and figure it out. But -- but it can't be that there's no point to an appeal. Because we're not going to give you back the fine.</turn>\n<turn>Frederick R. Yarger: Well --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: Now -- now, that, I stop right there and then I'm asking -- I don't know what your -- I have to ask him, and that's why his brief has several different arguments, because it's hard to figure out, but there's -- okay. Do you want to say anything in response to this question? (Laughter.)</turn>\n<turn>Frederick R. Yarger: Justice Breyer, I understand what you're struggling with. We -- we struggle with it as well, but the -- the law in Colorado supported by decisions of this Court and others in the 1800s and early 1900s suggests that this is a question of whether the State has decided to provide this kind of compensation. And if the Court rules that this is a matter of substantive procedural -- or excuse me, substantive right under the Constitution, I think you do encounter very significant problems about why compensation isn't awarded for the serious deprivation of liberty that occurs --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Why does it -- why does it matter who owns this money at this time under Colorado law? This was the defendants' money and it was taken away from them. So if -- at -- you say that at some point it ceased to be their money and it became the state's money. But then you have to show that it was taken away pursuant to due process, and consistent with due process.</turn>\n<turn>Frederick R. Yarger: Yes, and the due process is, as -- as Petitioners admit, and they did so below in their petitions for rehearing to the Colorado supreme court. They said that the -- the depravations of their liberty and their property comported with due process because a conviction supported the imposition of costs, fees, and restitution. I believe my friend Mr. Banner said it again today, so that is the due process that lead to the deprivation.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, how can the conviction -- how -- how can the conviction have been reversed if -- if they were convicted consistent with due process?</turn>\n<turn>Frederick R. Yarger: Your Honor, there were errors -- there were errors in these trials, but the question is whether there was process sufficient to allow the conviction to attach, and certainly Petitioners don't argue otherwise. If there were defects sufficient enough that this was a wrongful deprivation of liberty, for example, like the Manuel v. City of Joliet case this Court encountered. There would be a claim for compensation due to a wrongful defect in the due process in the procedures that led to that deprivation. But the question here, there was no wrongful conduct that occurred, there was an error that occurred. And the way that this Court's precedents have treated that is not as a return for property but as a claim for compensation.</turn>\n</context>\n<justice>Justice John G.

Roberts, Jr.: We will hear argument first this morning in Case 20-472, HollyFrontier Cheyenne Refining versus Renewable Fuels Association. Mr. Keisler.</turn>\n<turn>Peter D. Keisler: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The statute establishing the Renewable Fuel Standard exempted all small refineries from its requirements for the first years of the program and authorizes them individually to seek extensions of that exemption at any time based on hardship. The question here is whether it prohibits EPA from granting a hardship exemption to a small refinery that hasn't been continuously exempt for all prior years. Respondents claim it does. Under their view, a small refinery can receive exemptions indefinitely but only if it's never able to comply without hardship. If there's even one year in which it can comply without hardship, it's then disqualified for all future years. Nothing in the statute's text imposes this unique prohibition. Respondents' argument rests on the word \"extension,\" which they contend should be read temporally here to mean an increase in a length of time. But even if \"extension\" is read in its temporal sense, that does not require continuity. No dictionary defines \"extension\" to require continuity. And Congress has used the term elsewhere when it's specifically authorizing the temporal resumption of a benefit after a lapse. And where Congress has wanted to limit the term in the way Respondents urge, it's added limiting words, like \"successive\" or \"consecutive,\" which it didn't do here. A continuity requirement would also be contrary to this statute's purposes. The statutory design is to impose burdens that escalate dramatically over time. As the Department of Energy explained in 2011, some small refineries will face inherent and disproportionate hardships that will only arise or that will increase as those mandates grow. Driving those small refineries out of the market would undermine the statute's energy independence goals, and that's one of the reasons Congress authorized them to petition at any time based on hardship. I welcome the Court's questions.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Mr. Keisler, under your reading, which -- \"extend\" means to grant, you know, you extend an offer or extend condolences, could an entirely new refinery apply for an extension to it of a hardship -- hardship exemption? In other words, coming onto the scene for the first time, they would, under your view, I think, have to ask for an extension?</turn>\n<turn>Peter D. Keisler: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. If the Court adopted the make-available meaning of \"extension,\" then, yes, a completely new refinery that came into existence after the initial period would still be able to seek an extension of the exemption. But the Court could also construe \"extension\" in the temporal sense without requiring continuity, and in that case, it's certainly arguable that a new entrant would not be able to get an extension of the initial exemption, because it didn't have one, without there being any requirement that the extensions have been continuously enjoyed by others.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, which of those two readings of \"extension,\" I guess, each one of which you embrace, do you think is the right one?</turn>\n<turn>Peter D. Keisler: If we were forced to choose, Your Honor, we would acknowledge that reading \"extension\" in that temporal sense without continuity would enable the Court to avoid having to decide whether this is one of those instances in which the same word has different meanings within the same statute, and so, for that reason perhaps, that might be a preferred reading. But even in that circumstance, our key point would be that even the temporal meaning of \"extension\" does not require continuity. Congress has used it in exactly the other way multiple times, and no dictionary says that the temporal meaning of \"extension\" requires continuity.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, it seems like your sort of \"any port in a storm\" reading of this statute -- I'm not sure that -- I'm not sure that's the strongest position.</turn>\n<turn>Peter D. Keisler: Well, then, Your Honor, we would be happy to rely on the other construction of \"extension\" as well because \"extension\" is often used when there is some preexisting stat -- separately authorized benefit and it is being extended or made available to a different setting or time period or set of recipients, just like in 2015 when Congress enacted what it called an extension of Privacy Act remedies to citizens of certain foreign countries. It is a word that Congress often use when it is enlarging or extending the scope of a preexisting benefit. And we'd, of course, be happy with that reading here as well.

Kavanaugh: You -- you said -- you said, I think, to Justice Gorsuch, and I'm sorry to interrupt his question, but you said to Justice Gorsuch, I think, that the benefit for former slaves was not race-based. If that's correct, then the benefit for descendants of former slaves is also not race-based. There -- you can make other arguments if you want about that, but it does not seem to be race-based under what you said to Justice Gorsuch, correct?</turn>\n<turn>Cameron T. Norris: Well, not correct. I think there's a difference between the former slaves themselves getting a benefit versus generations later. I think that's the classification on the basis of ancestry, which is still problematic under this Court's precedents. And even if it's not directly race-based, I would assume that universities are -- are -- and it would depend on the record, but universities are drawing that classification as a proxy for race in ways that the Reconstruction Congress was not.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Okay. If I might just finish up. The Freedmen's Bureau is on the federal side. We have briefs before us that also talk about practice on the state side. Now we know that shortly after the Civil War there were a lot of race-based statutes passed by states, and most of them were Jim Crow laws that invidiously discriminated on the basis of race, but your friend on the other side cites two that he says are not, one from Kentucky and one from South Carolina. Could you address those?</turn>\n<turn>Cameron T. Norris: Yes. So we -- we cite a book full of statutes from the same era from states that were purely color blind, but they do cite two examples, one from South Carolina which I believe banned racial discrimination by government-licensed entities, and there was a finding by that legislature that our government-licensed entities were continuing to discriminate on the basis of race. I think it was a directly remedial measure and it made sense in light of, you know, the end of the war and the massive racial discrimination that was still ongoing. Now the Kentucky statute is even clearer. It gave benefits -- it wasn't a racial classification, but it gave benefits to a group of people in Mercer County, Kentucky, who had no property, were so injured they could no longer work, had no income. I mean -- I mean, I think that what the statute was talking about were the people -- the recently freed slaves in Mercer County to which there were many.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: And then I have one final question about this. There's also a question of whether we should pay attention to state practices given the language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which doesn't pertain to -- whether we should pay attention to federal side, sorry, given that the language of the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't purport to bar remedial measures or classifications by Congress, which at that time was in full Reconstruction efforts, but that the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment were especially concerned about racial classifications at the state level because so many of them, everyone knew, would be used, as Jim Crow laws were, to discriminate against African Americans.</turn>\n<turn>Cameron T. Norris: I think there's something to that, Justice Gorsuch. Justice Scalia recounted some of that history I think in Croson and maybe Adarand, where he said there's no reason to think that the same distrust of the federal government would have been there at the time. But I -- I -- I don't think any of these federal statutes are even particularly hard if you assume the equal protection principle binds the federal government because they are all plainly remedial.

I think I worry about it, because I'm worried about the woman's cooperative in India, I'm worried about the Chinese development, I'm worried about development everywhere.

Roberts, Jr.: Justice Kavanaugh.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Ms. Waggoner. I want to pick up on Justice Sotomayor's questions and try to figure out what's really at stake on this issue. Judge Jacobs in the Second Circuit opinion in Amato and Judge Henry in the Tenth Circuit opinion in Utah Animal Rights, their separate opinions, both suggested, as the government does here, that there's not much at stake because a defendant can always surrender to the judgment on the nominal damages claims when no other claims remain, and the district court simply enters judgment without adjudicating the merits.

Isn't that exactly right?</turn>\n<turn>Kristen Kellie Waggoner: I don't think that there's -- I don't think that it's right in the sense that there isn't much at stake for someone like Chike, who is silenced on his campus, or someone subject to an unlawful announce -- knock and announce or a graduation speaker --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M.

Isn't that correct?</turn>\n<turn>Kristen Kellie Waggoner: I think that that's an open question before this Court, and how it would apply in a nominal damages situation would be something that the Court would want to consider. But, certainly, if the Court --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Okay. And then --</turn>\n<turn>Kristen Kellie Waggoner: -- held that that was full redress, then -- then that -- that would be acceptable, but full redress would need to be provided. And Georgia's offered --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: And then --</turn>\n<turn>Kristen Kellie Waggoner: -- absolutely nothing.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: -- and then, in that instance, what -- what's the attorney's fee situation? Because that may be what's really at stake here. What -- what's the attorney's fee situation, in your view, with a nominal -- successful nominal damages claim?</turn>\n<turn>Kristen Kellie Waggoner: I think the Court has discretion to determine what the attorney's fees are. Under Farrar, the Court said that they would be a prevailing party. But most courts at the lower levels have applied the Justice O'Connor factors to look at various aspects of the case, what was asked for, and the significance of the issue that was decided.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Barrett.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Counsel, I want to go back to Justice Kagan's question. When she asked you if nominal damages were a form of compensatory damages, you said no. And, I mean, I -- I understand that they are not compensatory damages, you know, that they -- they are distinct categories and you can't prove them with specificity, can't prove nominal damages, I mean. But I would have thought that your argument depended on nominal damages being retrospective. I -- I took your argument to be that they were compensation for a hard-to- quantify or impossible-to-quantify harm. So can you explain a little bit more why you are not describing to Justice Kagan that nominal damages are backward-looking relief?</turn>\n<turn>Kristen Kellie Waggoner: All damages are backward-looking relief. And I -- I think, in terms of the compensatory nature of the damages, they're compensatory in that they're redressing a harm that has occurred. They're the same pedigree as compensatory damages, as well as statutory or liquidated damages.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: So it is your position that they are compensating for a -- an unquantifiable harm?</turn>\n<turn>Kristen Kellie Waggoner: Absolutely. As this Court articulated in Carey and Stachura, it's just that it's not a quantifiable harm. And so that's the distinction I was making.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Okay. Now I want to go back to your colloquy with Justice Breyer, and he was talking to you about Bradford's claim and asking why that wouldn't be moot. Can you identify any situation in which a case would be moot if the plaintiff also sought nominal damages? Putting aside Bradford's particular one, is there any case that would be moot if nominal damages were attached?</turn>\n<turn>Kristen Kellie Waggoner: No. This Court has held that damages can't be mooted, but prospective relief can be mooted. But that doesn't mean that everyone who asserts a nominal damages claim would prevail. There are many reasons why nominal --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: But -- but why not?</turn>\n<turn>Kristen Kellie Waggoner: -- damages can't be looking forward.</turn>\n</context>\n<justice>Justice Amy Coney Barrett</justice>\nGenerate a question that Justice Amy Coney Barrett is likely to ask next.", "output": "Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Why not?

Kavanaugh: -- and then, in that instance, what -- what's the attorney's fee situation? Because that may be what's really at stake here. What -- what's the attorney's fee situation, in your view, with a nominal -- successful nominal damages claim?</turn>\n<turn>Kristen Kellie Waggoner: I think the Court has discretion to determine what the attorney's fees are. Under Farrar, the Court said that they would be a prevailing party. But most courts at the lower levels have applied the Justice O'Connor factors to look at various aspects of the case, what was asked for, and the significance of the issue that was decided.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Barrett.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Counsel, I want to go back to Justice Kagan's question. When she asked you if nominal damages were a form of compensatory damages, you said no. And, I mean, I -- I understand that they are not compensatory damages, you know, that they -- they are distinct categories and you can't prove them with specificity, can't prove nominal damages, I mean. But I would have thought that your argument depended on nominal damages being retrospective. I -- I took your argument to be that they were compensation for a hard-to- quantify or impossible-to-quantify harm. So can you explain a little bit more why you are not describing to Justice Kagan that nominal damages are backward-looking relief?</turn>\n<turn>Kristen Kellie Waggoner: All damages are backward-looking relief. And I -- I think, in terms of the compensatory nature of the damages, they're compensatory in that they're redressing a harm that has occurred. They're the same pedigree as compensatory damages, as well as statutory or liquidated damages.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: So it is your position that they are compensating for a -- an unquantifiable harm?</turn>\n<turn>Kristen Kellie Waggoner: Absolutely. As this Court articulated in Carey and Stachura, it's just that it's not a quantifiable harm. And so that's the distinction I was making.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Okay. Now I want to go back to your colloquy with Justice Breyer, and he was talking to you about Bradford's claim and asking why that wouldn't be moot. Can you identify any situation in which a case would be moot if the plaintiff also sought nominal damages? Putting aside Bradford's particular one, is there any case that would be moot if nominal damages were attached?</turn>\n<turn>Kristen Kellie Waggoner: No. This Court has held that damages can't be mooted, but prospective relief can be mooted. But that doesn't mean that everyone who asserts a nominal damages claim would prevail. There are many reasons why nominal --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: But -- but why not?</turn>\n<turn>Kristen Kellie Waggoner: -- damages can't be looking forward.</turn>\n</context>\n<justice>Justice Amy Coney Barrett</justice>\nGenerate a question that Justice Amy Coney Barrett is likely to ask next.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett: But -- but why not?

And if you accept this interpretation that the district court adopted, and then the court of appeals said: Well, we will just give it deferential review; we won't even give it de novo review, it's -- it's, you know, one reasonable interpretation among many--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: Are you saying it's -- and these categories don't often help us. Is this a question of law? A mixed question of law and fact?</turn>\n<turn>Robert A. Long, Jr.: --Well, I think, in terms of whether this is a reasonable interpretation of the terms of the plan, it is a question of law. And I think it is unreasonable -- I mean, certainly, looking at the plan language, there is plan language that does speak to this, and then also, I mean, this--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: The court of appeals said it's just an application of equitable principles--</turn>\n<turn>Robert A. Long, Jr.: --Well, but--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: --not an interpretation of the plan.</turn>\n<turn>Robert A. Long, Jr.: --But it's a claim for benefits due under the terms of the plan.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Yes, yes.</turn>\n<turn>Robert A. Long, Jr.: You know, I read you the language. \"Accrued benefit\" is a defined term in the plan.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: And that's the statutory term? \"Benefits due under the terms of the plan. \" is a statutory term?</turn>\n<turn>Robert A. Long, Jr.: Yes. So, that -- that's what we're talking about. The Solicitor General agrees with us that if you're talking about the terms of the plan, even if you're trying to fashion a remedy for a violation of ERISA, that is still a de novo review question, and there would be terrible problems with uniformity of plan interpretation if you said, oh, well, you know, it's just a discretionary kind of review; let's let every district court interpret this plan in its own fashion. But -- but the notion of having -- essentially, what the district court's interpretation does is to say we're going to have a zero interest rate, which is -- I mean, the chief actuary's brief says they have never in their entire careers, none of them, have ever seen an ERISA plan that does that.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G.

It says the purposes are to transfer the enumerated set of services from IHS to the tribe. That's the purpose.

Unikowsky:  Okay. So the purposes of the contract -- I'll get to \"general\" -- the modifier \"general\" in just one second. The  purposes of the contract are laid out in the self-determination agreement -- contract itself. And that's part of the model agreement. It says the purposes are to transfer the enumerated set of services from IHS to the tribe. That's the purpose. So, in terms of what \"general purpose\" means, I think that gives the tribe a little bit of discretion. Just as one example, tribes have generally construed \"general purposes\" to open the door to building facilities at which the services will be offered. So, for instance, if, you know, the responsibility for dental services is transferred, tribes have construed that language to say you can build a clinic.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, is  -- are the -- could you give me a simpler answer or maybe it doesn't lend itself to a simpler answer?  Are the general purposes of the contract simply to further Indian health?</turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky:  No. I think it's narrower than that  --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  No?</turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky:  -- Your Honor.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Okay. In  -- in what way is it narrower?</turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky:  I think it's -- the general  purpose is you look at the purpose of the contract as laid out in the contract itself, and I think the word \"general\" modifier requires that at least it be related to those purposes, right, not just anything to do with Indian health. I just want to make one other point about that.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan:  So it's easier to say</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  But I still don't understand the -- could you just tell me what it means?</turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky:  Yeah. So  --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  What does it not mean? Suppose  -- suppose the tribe wants to set up a scholarship program for tribal members or Indians to go to medical school. Does that fall within the general purposes of the contract?</turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky:  I probably would say no. This question has never come up. It's never been litigated a single time for a practical reason.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah. Well, now it's being litigated.</turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky:  No, it's not, Your Honor, because there's no disputes in this case that we satisfy the general purposes provision. The reason that this generally has not --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  But we have to sa y what \"general purposes\" means.</turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky:  I don't think so, Your Honor. I think --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  No?</turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky:  -- that you should hold that, as long as that is satisfied, as long as the tribe are adhering to that contractual obligation, then it's -- it's acting pursuant to the contract. The reason this has not -- never been litigated, what \"general purposes\" means, is that the amount of money that the tribe gets is the sum of these two funding streams, and Congress understands that that sum is necessary just to serve the services under the contract. Like  --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Mr. Unikowsky?</turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky:  Yes?</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  There's not so much money here that the tribes are spending this on frolics and detours, right?  I mean  --</turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky:  That's correct, Your Honor. There's not even close to enough money.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  -- I mean, there's not even enough money to provide healthcare to the Indians on the reservations, and you're -- you're -- you're operating out of decrepit old buildings in many cases. And -- and that's what we're really talking about. Nor are Indian -- Indian Healthcare Services providing massive benefits to non-Indians all across America. We're talking about a reservation in central Wyoming with an incredibly poor population of Native Americans. And general purposes of the contract, you'd agree it has to be Indians?</turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky:  One hundred percent I agree, Your Honor.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  And in your contract, in terms of what's enumerated as the general purposes, include outpatient ambulatory  medical care and primary care, nursing, mental health, the clinical medical laboratory, radiology, physical therapy, the pharmacy, optometry, dental care, and community health.

And -- and I understand your answers to some of the questions, especially to Justice Alito, to be anything more than you would otherwise pay, even if it's $1 an hour, to the Amazon person, under Hardison, it's your understanding that that's a premium wage because it's more than they would otherwise receive.</turn>\n<turn>Elizabeth B.

We think this is the simplest route. You would simply extend Town of Greece rule for religious speech to symbolic speech and it would provide, in a situation where the chances for coercion and proselytization are much less than in the communal prayer --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Mr. Carvin, could you explain -- you have this coercion theory that you think you're urging us to adopt. But, if that's what the Establishment Clause prohibits, only coercion, how does this offer -- how does this office differ from the Free Exercise Clause? That is, can you suggest a practice that would be unconstitutionally coercive under the Establishment Clause and yet be inoffensive under the Free Exercise Clause?</turn>\n<turn>Michael A. Carvin: Yes, Your Honor, forcing us to pay threepence to a minister. That would violate my negative liberty not to support a church I don't want to, but it wouldn't violate any religious tenets or my ability to pursue the religion I do want to. So it creates a negative liberty not to support coercively religions which you do not support. I would also point out that this standard is completely the correct one under the text and history of the Establishment Clause because, when they were discussing all the hallmarks of establishment, what they were talking about was tangible interference. It also extends to proselytizing under this Court's decisions in both Town of Greece and the Allegheny County dissent, which is what we're asking the Court to adopt.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: What -- what counts as proselytizing? I think I understand what coercion means better than what proselytizing means.</turn>\n<turn>Michael A. Carvin: Well, I think it's actually very straightforward.

Carvin: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: While the Peace Cross should be upheld under any sensible Establishment Clause analysis, we submit the Court should analyze it under the Town of Greece coercion test, which prohibits tangible interference with religious liberty, as well as proselytizing, for a number of reasons. We think this is the simplest route. You would simply extend Town of Greece rule for religious speech to symbolic speech and it would provide, in a situation where the chances for coercion and proselytization are much less than in the communal prayer --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Mr. Carvin, could you explain -- you have this coercion theory that you think you're urging us to adopt. But, if that's what the Establishment Clause prohibits, only coercion, how does this offer -- how does this office differ from the Free Exercise Clause? That is, can you suggest a practice that would be unconstitutionally coercive under the Establishment Clause and yet be inoffensive under the Free Exercise Clause?</turn>\n<turn>Michael A. Carvin: Yes, Your Honor, forcing us to pay threepence to a minister. That would violate my negative liberty not to support a church I don't want to, but it wouldn't violate any religious tenets or my ability to pursue the religion I do want to. So it creates a negative liberty not to support coercively religions which you do not support. I would also point out that this standard is completely the correct one under the text and history of the Establishment Clause because, when they were discussing all the hallmarks of establishment, what they were talking about was tangible interference. It also extends to proselytizing under this Court's decisions in both Town of Greece and the Allegheny County dissent, which is what we're asking the Court to adopt.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: What -- what counts as proselytizing? I think I understand what coercion means better than what proselytizing means.</turn>\n<turn>Michael A. Carvin: Well, I think it's actually very straightforward. The definition is preaching conversion.

Yang:  You know, I'm not really sure where that standard comes from except unless you are drawing from Article III. We don't really object, I think, to the outcome of having some direct effect. Whether you're adversely affected, though, you don't  --I think it's the wrong question.

So going back to the pre-code Bankruptcy Act, and  --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan:  And -- sorry.</turn>\n<turn>Anthony A. Yang:  Sure.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan:  If I could just follow up. You -- you too -- and this is just like Ms. Ho  -- said at the outset this is --</turn>\n<turn>Anthony A. Yang:  Yeah.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan:  What if you don't really know whether your  --you have any interest in this until the middle of the thing? I mean, I can imagine many -- many events taking place, including there's now a plan on the table and now you look at the plan on the table and you think:  Oh, my gosh, I could be affected. It just seems a strange thing in a bankruptcy proceeding, which is fluid and has many twists and turns, that you would say do this at the outset and -- and apparently only at the outset.</turn>\n<turn>Anthony A. Yang:  Let me answer that, and I think it's easiest to answer it in the context  of executory contracts and creditors, right? Execut ory contracts, they're always going to have potentially some effect. Maybe you just, you know, don't know what the effect is going to be, and a lot of people who could be parties in interest, just because it doesn't fit into the -- it doesn't make rational economic sense, they don't participate, right?  They just don't participate until  --they have a right to, but they don't until it becomes relevant. The pre-Bankruptcy Act -- Code Act labels executory contractors as parties in interest. Why?  It's because they had to get advance notice of rejection. And there's a case called King versus Barrett in the Tenth Circuit, 1973, it explains that you're given notice in a hearing so that you can be heard. Currently, the current code says that the counterparty can seek an order to set a period to assume or reject. That's 365(d)(2). Other parties in interest may similarly set that  same period, but they can only do so in the context of status conferences. That's 105(d)(2)(A). All of this is showing that parties in interest  -- that --that executory counter  -- contract counterparties are parties in interest. Now there's a few things that I'd like to address. One is there's a question about having a voice and not a vote. I think that goes to the question of being impaired. Impaired is what the plan under Section 1124 proposes. But there are other requirements for a plan. For instance, a plan needs to be feasible. So, if you're a creditor and the plan proposes satisfying everything, but it satisfies it in a way that's not likely to end up being implemented, you can object under 1129(a), I think it's (a)(11), that the plan's not feasible. So the impairment just talks about the separate requirement that the classes vote. It doesn't address your right to be heard, which, by the way, is not only a right to be heard to object, but it's a right to be heard to support the plan, right?  If you're not impaired, you  may well want to come in and support the plan. The floodgates question, it largely turns, I think, on the question of any issue, not the problem of party in interest. Lik e take, for instance, the vending contractor that  -- that everyone's talking about. The problem is not that a vending contractor gets to come in and be a party in interest and participate with respect to the vending contract, whether it's assumed or rejected or interpreted in a way it doesn't like. The concern is that it's also heard on any issue. But the text of 1109(b) and its history, the evolution of expanding those groups that can speak on any issue, foreclose any real textual ability to say, oh, you can only participate on certain issues. \"Any issue\" means what it says. Secondly, the concerns about floodgates, I think, are totally overstated. Litigants make rational economic choices where they have a stake in reasonable arguments. The right to be heard doesn't impose on the court any burden to -- to speak at length if it doesn't think there's much to say about the issue. And the court has to decide the question anyway in terms of confirmation because this Court, in United Student Aid Funds, determined that the court has to decide whether  the plan complies with the code even if no one objects. And, finally, sanctions deters any kind of bad-faith conduct. Ultimately, this is a balancing question, does it make sense to bring everybody in, we're going to weigh it against maybe some burden of having their voices heard, we're going to balance it against the waste of resources of trying to decide who gets to  be heard, and Congress struck that choice in 1109(b).</turn>\n</context>\n<justice>Justice Brett M.

Bond: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At the heart of this case are two code provisions that are unambiguous and a third whose scope is disputed. The first clear provision is the Anti-Injunction Act, which bars a suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax. That text and this Court's decisions make clear that a suit cannot proceed if the relief it seeks would legally bar the IRS from collecting a tax, regardless of the plaintiff's objective or motive for bringing suit, as I understand Petitioner now to acknowledge. The second unambiguous provision is 6671, which provides that penalties imposed in subchapter 68(b) are treated as taxes. And by far, the most important consequence of that provision is that 68(b) penalties are subject to the AIA, which precludes pre-enforcement review and instead channels disputes to refund suits. Together, those two provisions resolve this case because Petitioner's complaint on its face at page 16 seeks to enjoin the enforcement of reporting requirements that are enforced by 68(b) penalties. Petitioner leans heavily on a third provision, Section 7203, which makes certain willful violations a misdemeanor and which it says requires committing a crime to obtain judicial review. But Petitioner misreads that provision, which does not criminalize the very avenue of review this Court commended 93 years ago in Sullivan and has reaffirmed since, of filing a timely return that asserts a good faith objection to reporting certain information in order to obtain review. Petitioner can do that by incurring the penalty, paying it, and suing for a refund. But even if 7203's application were ambiguous, the way to harmonize all three provisions is to hold that Congress meant what it said unambiguously in 6671 and the AIA, that these penalties are treated as taxes that must be litigated in refund suits, and resolve any lingering dispute about \"willfully\" to preserve Congress's choice. Petitioner's approach of leveraging one disputed word in another provision to override the clear text of 6671 and the AIA has things backwards.

If that relief would legally bar the collection of a tax, then, yes, Congress made the determination to channel that dispute to refund suits. It's not eliminating review. It's simply channeling it to a different forum.

And we know that that review is real because that's been the case throughout the AIA's history, going back to Bailey versus George, that the same day that the Court held the pre-enforcement suit barred, the Court reached the merits in a refund suit.

I mean, the jury had only two choices, death or life without parole. And nobody seemed to have appreciated at the time of Malvo's convictions that there was any discretion. And the -- and the piece of information I'd like to have, has any Virginia judge ever reduced a juvenile life without parole to life with parole or a term of years?</turn>\n<turn>Toby J. Heytens: Justice Ginsburg, I'm not aware of any Virginia judge ever reducing a juvenile life without parole sentence for a person convicted of capital murder, which was the offense that Malvo is convicted of. I -- I believe that's factually true, that I'm not aware of an example. There have been examples of Virginia courts considering whether to do so, although those long pre-date Malvo's sentence -- I -- I acknowledge that those post-date Malvo's sentence. To go to your question about what the jury was instructed, that is what the jury was instructed, but Virginia law is extremely clear that the sentencer is not the jury. The sentencer is the judge. And under the Supreme Court of Virginia's holding in Jones II, which Malvo does not and cannot challenge, this trial judge had the authority to suspend the sentence as a matter of state law and not only had the authority to do it but had the authority to do it at the time of Malvo's trial. That's the specific issue that the Supreme Court of Virginia addressed in Jones, and I think that's a binding holding as a matter of --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: But did the judge know he could, given that there was no history of doing it? I think that's -- that's the position of the SG in this case.

I mean, the jury had only two choices, death or life without parole. And nobody seemed to have appreciated at the time of Malvo's convictions that there was any discretion. And the -- and the piece of information I'd like to have, has any Virginia judge ever reduced a juvenile life without parole to life with parole or a term of years?</turn>\n<turn>Toby J. Heytens: Justice Ginsburg, I'm not aware of any Virginia judge ever reducing a juvenile life without parole sentence for a person convicted of capital murder, which was the offense that Malvo is convicted of. I -- I believe that's factually true, that I'm not aware of an example. There have been examples of Virginia courts considering whether to do so, although those long pre-date Malvo's sentence -- I -- I acknowledge that those post-date Malvo's sentence. To go to your question about what the jury was instructed, that is what the jury was instructed, but Virginia law is extremely clear that the sentencer is not the jury. The sentencer is the judge. And under the Supreme Court of Virginia's holding in Jones II, which Malvo does not and cannot challenge, this trial judge had the authority to suspend the sentence as a matter of state law and not only had the authority to do it but had the authority to do it at the time of Malvo's trial. That's the specific issue that the Supreme Court of Virginia addressed in Jones, and I think that's a binding holding as a matter of --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: But did the judge know he could, given that there was no history of doing it?

Section 853(a)(1) makes the forfeitable proceeds the tainted property or tainted proceeds the forfeitable property.

And that's what the government has to seize, and that's what's forfeitable under 853(a)(1). And in that circumstance, I didn't say they are both liable for the forfeiture. The government doesn't have to prove which of them is responsible for the cash.

Given a transcript excerpt and a Justice's name, generate the Justice's next question in response to the conversation history.", "instruction": "<context>\n<turn>Andrew Rozynski: Sure. Two things. One, in 1986, Congress ratified and said that in terms of remedies, remedies at law and at equity would be available. So this, we would say, is a little bit higher than when Congress hasn't spoken to it at all. And as to -- this Court has already said that compensatory damages are available. And if you look to statutes, such as the Fair Housing Act or 1983, those statutes don't specifically say emotional distress damages are available. They say compense -- the Court has said that these statutes actually allow for compensatory damages and emotional -- and, therefore, uncapped emotional distress damages. And so, if you look to when Congress hasn't specifically carved out saying either emotional distress damages are not available, like the Prison Litigation Reform Act, or if you look at Title VII, when Congress specifically spoke to the issue and says they're available, but they're capped. Usually, what we see in all the statutes that, if compensatory damages are available for discrimination, they are not capped and they are available for emotional distress. So --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Well, not in Title VII, you said, right?</turn>\n<turn>Andrew Rozynski: Because Congress has specifically spoken to the issue and has limited it. But, when they are actually -- when Congress doesn't limit it in, say, the Fair Housing Act and in 1983 claims, they have been available uncapped. And those statutes don't specifically say emotional distress damages are available.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Does it matter --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Some of --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Oh, sorry, go ahead.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Some of the amici point to very large recoveries, and I think that that's what Justice Kavanaugh is referring to. And so what he's concerned about is that under Title VII there's limits for discrimination. If we recognize emotional distress damages here, there are no limits. So there would be a disparity between Title VII and discrimination here. Why should we accept that disparity? I think that that's the essence of his question, and he can always correct me.</turn>\n<turn>Andrew Rozynski: Sure. So the -- the interesting thing about this case is that the courts almost uniformly have allowed emotional distress damages or left them undisturbed. This Court, four times in the past, in awards of emotional distress damages, have left it undisturbed. And so, if this Court were to reverse, it would just be leaving the status quo of what's been going on for the last 30 years. And what we find is that the damages have not been outrageous or very high. They have to go to -- they have to go to other statutes, like 1983 and Title VII, and -- and most of those involve state discrimination laws in which awards were high. But we have procedures and processes to cabin high awards, and we have remitter, we have -- we have jury instructions to show to the jury that we -- that it must be supported by competent evidence. And there's a good reason why Respondent doesn't actually cite to any Title VI -- VI cases when they try to show these huge, huge awards, is because there -- for the past 30 years, there haven't been any.

Two things. One, in 1986, Congress ratified and said that in terms of remedies, remedies at law and at equity would be available. So this, we would say, is a little bit higher than when Congress hasn't spoken to it at all. And as to -- this Court has already said that compensatory damages are available. And if you look to statutes, such as the Fair Housing Act or 1983, those statutes don't specifically say emotional distress damages are available. They say compense -- the Court has said that these statutes actually allow for compensatory damages and emotional -- and, therefore, uncapped emotional distress damages. And so, if you look to when Congress hasn't specifically carved out saying either emotional distress damages are not available, like the Prison Litigation Reform Act, or if you look at Title VII, when Congress specifically spoke to the issue and says they're available, but they're capped. Usually, what we see in all the statutes that, if compensatory damages are available for discrimination, they are not capped and they are available for emotional distress. So --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Well, not in Title VII, you said, right?</turn>\n<turn>Andrew Rozynski: Because Congress has specifically spoken to the issue and has limited it. But, when they are actually -- when Congress doesn't limit it in, say, the Fair Housing Act and in 1983 claims, they have been available uncapped. And those statutes don't specifically say emotional distress damages are available.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Does it matter --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Some of --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Oh, sorry, go ahead.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Some of the amici point to very large recoveries, and I think that that's what Justice Kavanaugh is referring to. And so what he's concerned about is that under Title VII there's limits for discrimination. If we recognize emotional distress damages here, there are no limits. So there would be a disparity between Title VII and discrimination here. Why should we accept that disparity? I think that that's the essence of his question, and he can always correct me.</turn>\n<turn>Andrew Rozynski: Sure. So the -- the interesting thing about this case is that the courts almost uniformly have allowed emotional distress damages or left them undisturbed. This Court, four times in the past, in awards of emotional distress damages, have left it undisturbed. And so, if this Court were to reverse, it would just be leaving the status quo of what's been going on for the last 30 years. And what we find is that the damages have not been outrageous or very high. They have to go to -- they have to go to other statutes, like 1983 and Title VII, and -- and most of those involve state discrimination laws in which awards were high. But we have procedures and processes to cabin high awards, and we have remitter, we have -- we have jury instructions to show to the jury that we -- that it must be supported by competent evidence. And there's a good reason why Respondent doesn't actually cite to any Title VI -- VI cases when they try to show these huge, huge awards, is because there -- for the past 30 years, there haven't been any. And so the Court has 30 years of evidence to show that these haven't been huge, untethered to actually the harm that was actually done.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

Do you have anything to add to the statutory language?</turn>\n<turn>Christina A. Swarns: You know, I don't think -- I -- I don't have additional language. I think this Court has made quite clear that it's a threshold application. What this case demonstrates is that the Fifth Circuit has not been, and as this Court has noted in previous decisions, that the Fifth Circuit has not scrupulously adhered to the application of the COA standard, and the data that we provided to this Court sort of amplifies and demonstrates that fact.

I think that, however, the heart of those -- that evidence was sort of the facts and circumstances of the instant crime, Mr. Buck's lack of remorse immediately after he was arrested for the instant crime, and the domestic violence incidents and the prior offenses. This Court has recognized that aggravated crimes like this, exactly like the kind we are talking about here, can and do trigger a racialized fear of violence that can yield arbitrary death sentencing decisions. That was your holding in Turner v. Murray. So the fact that we do face a case that does have very aggravated facts sort of compounds the risk of prejudice to Mr. Buck. And what we have here is a circumstance where not only do the terrible facts of the crime trigger that real risk of an arbitrary death sentencing decision, you have the expert stepping in and compounding that risk and putting it -- putting an expert scientific validity to this pernicious idea that Mr. Buck would be more likely to commit criminal acts of violence because he's black.

And so all of those things may be statutory arguments, Justice Scalia, but they are also constitutional arguments.

Farley: Well, the Kentucky Supreme Court's first prong of their test, and I believe it's in our petition appendix on page 26 -- I'm sorry. Their -- their discussion starts on page 44a and carries over to 46A. The first question of their test is whether or not the officers acted in bad faith in an attempt to purposefully evade the warrant requirements.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: That didn't -- that didn't apply in this case?</turn>\n<turn>Joshua D. Farley: That is correct. The second prong of the Kentucky Supreme Court's test is whether or not the actions of the Respondent in this case or the occupant of the home would have been foreseeable by the police officers before they knocked and announced their presence. Now, the problem with the foreseeability test--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Why is -- why is that subjective? Why isn't that, wouldn't it be foreseeable to a reasonable police officer similarly situated?</turn>\n<turn>Joshua D. Farley: --Well, Justice Ginsburg, it -- it isn't directly a subjective inquiry. However, police officers are trained to expect and foresee illegal activity so that they may carry out the duties of their job in protecting the citizens. So under a foreseeability test, a police officer will always foresee illegal activity in response to his actions. Be it walking down the street or knocking on your door, a reasonable officer will always foresee illegal activity, and for that reason, the Kentucky Supreme Court's test is completely unworkable. Several of the other circuits and the lower courts have adopted tests that also attempt to add an extra exception, an unwarranted closure of the exigent circumstances exception that narrows the use of that exception by police officers. The test that the Commonwealth would propose is a simple lawfulness test. Now, under this test, as long as an officer behaves lawfully, there should be no suppression of evidence seized after an otherwise reasonable search--</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: So, you have an apartment building where the police know from experience there is a lot of illegal activity, a lot of drugs, drug transactions. Every 2 weeks they walk through and knock on every door and wait for evidence of the destruction of -- of -- of drugs. Is that all right?</turn>\n<turn>Joshua D. Farley: --Well, there's -- I would say yes, if there is probable cause as well as--</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, the probable cause, of course, comes when they hear the, you know, flushing and, you know, the hiding or whatever behind the door.</turn>\n<turn>Joshua D. Farley: --Well, I would assert that there are -- there are two separate issues here. You must have probable cause separate from the existence of exigent circumstances. In this case there was probable cause due to the smell of marijuana.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: They go to the apartment building and they sniff at every door, and when they sniff, when a strong smell of marijuana emanates from the door, then they go through this routine, but they do it as a matter of every 2 weeks, as the Chief said, as a routine matter. They don't just knock on every door, but they knock on the doors where they smell marijuana, and they do that just as a routine, in all the buildings where they suspect there may be drug -- drugs being stashed.</turn>\n<turn>Joshua D.

Farley: Well, the Kentucky Supreme Court's first prong of their test, and I believe it's in our petition appendix on page 26 -- I'm sorry. Their -- their discussion starts on page 44a and carries over to 46A. The first question of their test is whether or not the officers acted in bad faith in an attempt to purposefully evade the warrant requirements.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: That didn't -- that didn't apply in this case?</turn>\n<turn>Joshua D. Farley: That is correct. The second prong of the Kentucky Supreme Court's test is whether or not the actions of the Respondent in this case or the occupant of the home would have been foreseeable by the police officers before they knocked and announced their presence. Now, the problem with the foreseeability test--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Why is -- why is that subjective? Why isn't that, wouldn't it be foreseeable to a reasonable police officer similarly situated?</turn>\n<turn>Joshua D. Farley: --Well, Justice Ginsburg, it -- it isn't directly a subjective inquiry. However, police officers are trained to expect and foresee illegal activity so that they may carry out the duties of their job in protecting the citizens. So under a foreseeability test, a police officer will always foresee illegal activity in response to his actions. Be it walking down the street or knocking on your door, a reasonable officer will always foresee illegal activity, and for that reason, the Kentucky Supreme Court's test is completely unworkable. Several of the other circuits and the lower courts have adopted tests that also attempt to add an extra exception, an unwarranted closure of the exigent circumstances exception that narrows the use of that exception by police officers. The test that the Commonwealth would propose is a simple lawfulness test. Now, under this test, as long as an officer behaves lawfully, there should be no suppression of evidence seized after an otherwise reasonable search--</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: So, you have an apartment building where the police know from experience there is a lot of illegal activity, a lot of drugs, drug transactions. Every 2 weeks they walk through and knock on every door and wait for evidence of the destruction of -- of -- of drugs. Is that all right?</turn>\n<turn>Joshua D. Farley: --Well, there's -- I would say yes, if there is probable cause as well as--</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, the probable cause, of course, comes when they hear the, you know, flushing and, you know, the hiding or whatever behind the door.</turn>\n<turn>Joshua D. Farley: --Well, I would assert that there are -- there are two separate issues here. You must have probable cause separate from the existence of exigent circumstances. In this case there was probable cause due to the smell of marijuana.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: They go to the apartment building and they sniff at every door, and when they sniff, when a strong smell of marijuana emanates from the door, then they go through this routine, but they do it as a matter of every 2 weeks, as the Chief said, as a routine matter. They don't just knock on every door, but they knock on the doors where they smell marijuana, and they do that just as a routine, in all the buildings where they suspect there may be drug -- drugs being stashed.</turn>\n<turn>Joshua D. Farley: Justice Ginsburg, under a simple lawfulness test, since the officers have not violated the Fourth Amendment prior to the exigency arising, there would be no need to suppress any evidence. That would be perfectly fine for the officers to do that. It may not be the most--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: --to the Chief Justice when he said -- and I think this was the Solicitor General's position -- that the police can routinely knock at a door and wait to see if they hear a toilet flushing. I -- I've taken it out of this case but -- because I don't know what noise means. But your answer would be yes?</turn>\n<turn>Joshua D. Farley: --Yes, if -- if probable cause exists.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Well, why -- why do you need the probable cause inquiry? What does it have to do with anything?</turn>\n<turn>Joshua D. Farley: Well, under the Fourth Amendment for a reasonable warrantless search to occur, a police officer must have--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Before they can go in--</turn>\n<turn>Joshua D. Farley: --Yes. The police officers must have--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: --because they have just heard the toilet flushing?</turn>\n<turn>Joshua D.

The most prominent discussion of the Elections Clause in the early republic occurred during Massachusetts' 1820 Constitutional Convention. Joseph Story, then a sitting Justice on this Court, explained that a proposed constitutional amendment requiring representatives to be elected in districts would violate the Elections Clause because that clause vested state legislatures \"with an unlimited discretion in the subject.\" Justice Story's view was an echo of Alexander Hamilton's father-in-law, Senator Philip Schuyler, who took the exact same position on behalf of the entire New York State Senate just one month after the ratification of the Constitution.

And we're comfortable with a rule saying that a defendant can point to additional evidence. We don't --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Wait, wait. If -- if I just understood you correctly, Mr. Snyder, you basically said that what you just -- what you said previously to Justice Alito, that you could be fine with that not being a part of our holding, that -- you know, basically, that this case involves only record evidence and would be different from a case that -- where the evidence was outside the record. Is that right?</turn>\n<turn>Benjamin W. Snyder: Yes, that is correct. If I could make one more, I think, related point, there's been a discussion -- this -- this discussion has sort of focused on the notion that Petitioner didn't have any basis for disputing knowledge of status in the district court proceedings, and he said he had no reason to dispute that at sentencing. With respect, I don't think that that's realistic. I mean, prior to Rehaif -- Rehaif, knowledge of status wasn't an element of the offense. But a -- a defendant had every reason to dispute his knowledge of status at sentencing because, if he -- if he had a genuine argument that he didn't know, that would be powerful evidence going to culpability and, therefore, relevant to the --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Thank you, Mr. Snyder.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

If we were to rule for you in this case, would we have to say that when a court conducts a 52(a) analysis, a harmless-error analysis, it's likewise not constricted to the trial court record and can look at other things in the -- in the district court record?</turn>\n<turn>Benjamin W.

{"system_prompt": "You are a Supreme Court Justice participating in oral arguments. Given a transcript excerpt and a Justice's name, generate the Justice's next question in response to the conversation history.", "instruction": "<context>\n<turn>Jean-Claude Andre: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In these three cases, each of the three petitioners filed administrative grievances with the Michigan Department of Corrections. The Michigan Department of Corrections conducted investigations and issued final decisions on the merits of petitioner's grievances. Nevertheless, a year and a half later, each of the petitioner's complaints was thrown out of federal court without leave to amend because petitioners failed to satisfy on of the Sixth Circuit's judge-made corollaries to the PLRA's exhaustion requirement. None of those three corollaries find any meaningful support in the Federal Rules of Procedure, in fact they contradict the federal rules. Nor do they find any support in administrative law or habeas law, the two areas of law to which this Court looks for guidance in interpreting administrative litigation and format. Finally, the overwhelming majority of the circuits that have considered these questions have rejected them all. I'd like to begin with the heightened pleading rule that the Sixth District applied here. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require a plaintiff to simply provide a short claim statement of the basis on which his or her claim will lie. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do enumerate certain kinds of allegations that a plaintiff must plead with specificity, those are enumerated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(c), but exhaustion is not one of them. Accordingly--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: Suppose the district court finds that in its experience, 80 percent of the claims are ones that are unexhausted, just assume that. And the district court said, the only way I can figure out the good 20 percent from the 80 percent that are going to ultimately be dismissed is to have a motion for a more definite, an order for a more definite statement, because I'll do it sua sponte under 12(e), I think. Can the district court do that?</turn>\n<turn>Jean-Claude Andre: --I think that would be correct, and that would be consistent with the Court's habeas jurisprudence.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: The court could ask for a pleading which set forth the facts of exhaustion?</turn>\n<turn>Jean-Claude Andre: I believe that's true.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: Then why isn't this... this is just the same if the court has said, you know, in order to make our screening function efficient, we just have to know about exhaustion.</turn>\n<turn>Jean-Claude Andre: Well, first of all, when Congress created the various screening provisions in the PLRA, it noticeably omitted exhaustion. It clearly had exhaustion in mind when it enacted the PLRA. The term 42 U.S.C. 1997--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: How about, what, if you concede the district court could do it in individual cases or in most cases, why can't the Sixth Circuit do it? That's my question.</turn>\n<turn>Jean-Claude Andre: --Well, what sets the Sixth Circuit's rule apart from I think the hypothetical you propose, and also from this Court's habeas jurisprudence is that in both of those scenarios the plaintiff, the prisoner, is given a chance to respond. In the Sixth Circuit, if they don't they don't satisfy the heightened pleading rule at the minute that they file their initial complaint, they are out. There is no leave to amend, and that's what happened in this case. In Petitioner Jones' case, he filed the complaint and he actually did allege that he exhausted his administrative remedies. He said: I exhausted my administrative remedies, I filed my step one grievance on this date, I received a denial on that date, and he went down the list through all three steps.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: The briefs point out that a number of district courts have form complaints that are often used in these cases and that these forms call on the prisoner-plaintiff to address the issue of exhaustion. Now, do you think there's something wrong with those forms, and if a prisoner fills out the form and reveals in filling it out that a claim was not exhausted, is it improper for the district court at the screening stage to dismiss the case?</turn>\n<turn>Jean-Claude Andre: With respect to the form, I don't think that the form is improper, but I think it would be improper for a court to dismiss the prisoner's case if the prisoner failed to fill out the section of the form that asks him about exhaustion because exhaustion is an affirmative defense in both administrative law and habeas, and there's no indication in this statute that Congress--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: If it's an affirmative defense, then why is it... why is it proper for a district court, for a district court, to have a form that calls on the plaintiff to negate the affirmative defense?</turn>\n<turn>Jean-Claude Andre: --I think the district court can ask the plaintiff pretty much whatever the district court likes. But whether the district court could, could dismiss a case for failure to comply, failure to respond to that question, that's another matter.</turn>\n</context>\n<justice>Justice John G.

The Michigan Department of Corrections conducted investigations and issued final decisions on the merits of petitioner's grievances. Nevertheless, a year and a half later, each of the petitioner's complaints was thrown out of federal court without leave to amend because petitioners failed to satisfy on of the Sixth Circuit's judge-made corollaries to the PLRA's exhaustion requirement. None of those three corollaries find any meaningful support in the Federal Rules of Procedure, in fact they contradict the federal rules. Nor do they find any support in administrative law or habeas law, the two areas of law to which this Court looks for guidance in interpreting administrative litigation and format. Finally, the overwhelming majority of the circuits that have considered these questions have rejected them all. I'd like to begin with the heightened pleading rule that the Sixth District applied here. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require a plaintiff to simply provide a short claim statement of the basis on which his or her claim will lie. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do enumerate certain kinds of allegations that a plaintiff must plead with specificity, those are enumerated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(c), but exhaustion is not one of them. Accordingly--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: Suppose the district court finds that in its experience, 80 percent of the claims are ones that are unexhausted, just assume that. And the district court said, the only way I can figure out the good 20 percent from the 80 percent that are going to ultimately be dismissed is to have a motion for a more definite, an order for a more definite statement, because I'll do it sua sponte under 12(e), I think. Can the district court do that?</turn>\n<turn>Jean-Claude Andre: --I think that would be correct, and that would be consistent with the Court's habeas jurisprudence.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: The court could ask for a pleading which set forth the facts of exhaustion?</turn>\n<turn>Jean-Claude Andre: I believe that's true.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: Then why isn't this... this is just the same if the court has said, you know, in order to make our screening function efficient, we just have to know about exhaustion.</turn>\n<turn>Jean-Claude Andre: Well, first of all, when Congress created the various screening provisions in the PLRA, it noticeably omitted exhaustion. It clearly had exhaustion in mind when it enacted the PLRA. The term 42 U.S.C. 1997--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: How about, what, if you concede the district court could do it in individual cases or in most cases, why can't the Sixth Circuit do it? That's my question.</turn>\n<turn>Jean-Claude Andre: --Well, what sets the Sixth Circuit's rule apart from I think the hypothetical you propose, and also from this Court's habeas jurisprudence is that in both of those scenarios the plaintiff, the prisoner, is given a chance to respond. In the Sixth Circuit, if they don't they don't satisfy the heightened pleading rule at the minute that they file their initial complaint, they are out. There is no leave to amend, and that's what happened in this case. In Petitioner Jones' case, he filed the complaint and he actually did allege that he exhausted his administrative remedies. He said: I exhausted my administrative remedies, I filed my step one grievance on this date, I received a denial on that date, and he went down the list through all three steps.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: The briefs point out that a number of district courts have form complaints that are often used in these cases and that these forms call on the prisoner-plaintiff to address the issue of exhaustion. Now, do you think there's something wrong with those forms, and if a prisoner fills out the form and reveals in filling it out that a claim was not exhausted, is it improper for the district court at the screening stage to dismiss the case?</turn>\n<turn>Jean-Claude Andre: With respect to the form, I don't think that the form is improper, but I think it would be improper for a court to dismiss the prisoner's case if the prisoner failed to fill out the section of the form that asks him about exhaustion because exhaustion is an affirmative defense in both administrative law and habeas, and there's no indication in this statute that Congress--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: If it's an affirmative defense, then why is it... why is it proper for a district court, for a district court, to have a form that calls on the plaintiff to negate the affirmative defense?</turn>\n<turn>Jean-Claude Andre: --I think the district court can ask the plaintiff pretty much whatever the district court likes. But whether the district court could, could dismiss a case for failure to comply, failure to respond to that question, that's another matter.</turn>\n</context>\n<justice>Justice John G.

We're talking about individuals who are hauled before administrative agencies, who ultimately want to present their claim to an Article III court. And the other difference, of course, is subject matter jurisdiction, although, you know, protected in -- in some respects under the Constitution, here, we're talking about constitutional violations. And this Court has -- has always, going back hundreds of years, recognized the historic role of district courts in being open to hear and redress government -- unconstitutional government action, particularly of the structural type.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: I'm still not sure why. I thought that the whole purpose of a special review scheme, especially one that puts review in an agency, is to consolidate rather than bifurcate review of agency action. And, here, as the government pointed out, when it did want a bifurcation with temporary cease-and-desist orders, Congress made an exception, sending back to the district court. So I think that really shows you that when Congress wants to send something else, it knows how to. That's what it did in the CSRA review scheme. So I don't -- unlike Elgin, I have a hard time thinking why the nature of the constitutional claim would deprive the parties and the -- or the district court of -- of clear guidance that that should go through the scheme.</turn>\n<turn>Gregory G.

Garre: In that case, the Court held that you didn't have to exhaust Appointments Clause challenges before administrative agencies, that you could bring that independent -- bring that in -- in Article III court. And because of the -- the -- the unique nature of structural constitutional claims among other considerations, but in discussing structural constitutional claims, the Court cited numerous cases of examples, including the Free Enterprise Fund case. In terms of why they're different, Your Honor, we're suffering by -- the mere fact of having to proceed before an unconstitutional agency decisionmaker inflicts what this Court called a here-and-now injury that exists wholly apart from the ultimate outcome of that proceeding. And that's different from almost any other type of preliminary challenge you could imagine --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: But, if there's a --</turn>\n<turn>Gregory G.

Garre: So I think this Court has recognized that structural constitutional claims are different in terms of how they inflict injury that's separate and unique. And the other point I would say is, in order to get meaningful redress of that injury, you need an injunction that stops the proceedings, forcing you -- that prevents you from having to undergo them again. And that's different from a case where, even if you've suffered a due process violation based on the particular application of a rule or a statute, you could get relief from that, getting relief from the order.

Garre: I think -- I mean, first of all, it -- you're before an Article III court. You're not before an administrative decisionmaker that is not independent, protected with the protections of Article III. And I think -- and that's -- that's important. We're talking about individuals who are hauled before administrative agencies, who ultimately want to present their claim to an Article III court. And the other difference, of course, is subject matter jurisdiction, although, you know, protected in -- in some respects under the Constitution, here, we're talking about constitutional violations. And this Court has -- has always, going back hundreds of years, recognized the historic role of district courts in being open to hear and redress government -- unconstitutional government action, particularly of the structural type.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: I'm still not sure why. I thought that the whole purpose of a special review scheme, especially one that puts review in an agency, is to consolidate rather than bifurcate review of agency action. And, here, as the government pointed out, when it did want a bifurcation with temporary cease-and-desist orders, Congress made an exception, sending back to the district court. So I think that really shows you that when Congress wants to send something else, it knows how to. That's what it did in the CSRA review scheme. So I don't -- unlike Elgin, I have a hard time thinking why the nature of the constitutional claim would deprive the parties and the -- or the district court of -- of clear guidance that that should go through the scheme.</turn>\n<turn>Gregory G. Garre: So I think --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: I still don't understand. Is there something special about structural constitutional claims? And I don't really know what they are because, for you, it's easy. It's removal. Okay? But your colleague, Mr. Clement, wants to go broader on what structural is.

We can -- we can disagree whether it's impermissibly retroactive, where it actually would be unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause to try that kind of remedy, but it is at least severely retroactive. And if it is, it would be extraordinary for this Court, I can't think of a single case where this Court has said in fashioning a remedy it can ignore the fact that the remedy that the Court itself would be unleashing through a judge-made order, it has to make up this judge-made remedy and then it has to make up that that same judge-made remedy applies retroactively, which is strongly disfavored in the law. So I -- so I think that's one major obstacle. A second major obstacle is that the government's suggestion of just sending out bills to debtors is simply wrong. That's not the way bankruptcy works. And, in fact, the government's proposal would violate multiple sections of the code. And they can't just wipe -- just waive away those violations. If Congress wants to set aside affirmative provisions of the United States Code and the Bankruptcy Code that bar the government's relief, then Congress can do that, but I don't think this Court can.

But, as I was sitting down, like, with my law clerk and we were debating this, we were trying to figure out, in many equal protection cases, which would be, you know, similar to the Uniformity Clause, where you're talking about discriminatory treatment, the kind of relief sought is just to end the disparity moving forward and it's equitable relief that's sought, which seems to me a possible distinction between citizenship and -- and those sorts of things.

Goldstein: So I -- the two I think that are -- are quite on point are the Huynh case and the Macias case that I gave, so the California Court of Appeals and the Washington Supreme Court. And I -- I do think I should, you know, to be fair to my friend, address the other examples. And so he gives the airplane, okay? So you -- you manufacture an airplane. It is -- a few things about that. First, airplanes actually do work without seats. You know, some -- if not, somebody better tell FedEx, which is shipping things all over the country. But at the very least, they work with lots of different kinds of seats. That's why some people fly Emirates and not Spirit, because some of the seats will be much, much closer in and have a much greater risk of injury for them. And that's why we don't say, as the court of appeals did here, that the airplane will only work in a situation in which you are going to be exposed to it. But I'll give you another airplane hypothetical that I would hope come out this way, and that is the airplane manufacturer attaches Rolls Royce engines. You know that working on the engine can expose you to terrible shock and being killed or gasoline will poor out of it or oil will pull out -- pour out of it. I hope that they -- we want the airplane manufacturer to warn about that because that -- that plane will not operate without those engines and you are going to be exposed to that risk in the course of maintaining that machine.

The ashtray does not actually contribute to your injury. What you have is you have a toxic product that you're making a choice to use that you are putting down. It would be like saying this -- and I think it's a great example for us because it highlights why we are not saying they're responsible for every harm from asbestos, including this asbestos. It would be like us saying: Your machine only works with asbestos; you're liable because I got sick because the storage room had the asbestos in it. We're not just saying kind of but-for causation that there was a relationship between them. You can put your cancer-causing cigarette down in the ashtray and not be liable for it, but if it is the case -- I'll give you an example. What if the ashtray is made of paper? Okay? If the ashtray is made of paper, so that if you put something lit in it, they will cause -- it will cause combustion and it will burn --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A.

And I -- I do think I should, you know, to be fair to my friend, address the other examples. And so he gives the airplane, okay? So you -- you manufacture an airplane. It is -- a few things about that. First, airplanes actually do work without seats. You know, some -- if not, somebody better tell FedEx, which is shipping things all over the country. But at the very least, they work with lots of different kinds of seats. That's why some people fly Emirates and not Spirit, because some of the seats will be much, much closer in and have a much greater risk of injury for them. And that's why we don't say, as the court of appeals did here, that the airplane will only work in a situation in which you are going to be exposed to it. But I'll give you another airplane hypothetical that I would hope come out this way, and that is the airplane manufacturer attaches Rolls Royce engines. You know that working on the engine can expose you to terrible shock and being killed or gasoline will poor out of it or oil will pull out -- pour out of it. I hope that they -- we want the airplane manufacturer to warn about that because that -- that plane will not operate without those engines and you are going to be exposed to that risk in the course of maintaining that machine. That's the much more analogous hypothetical of ours.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: What about the ashtray? You didn't answer the question.</turn>\n<turn>Thomas C. Goldstein: Oh, I'm sorry. I had said that the ashtray could be used for a lot of different things.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A.

Goldstein: No, I -- I just tried to give -- among the distinctions is certainly that. And so it wouldn't fit within the Third Circuit's --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: What if I don't think that's much of a distinction?</turn>\n<turn>Thomas C. Goldstein: Okay. Then there are -- there are others, and that is the ashtray does not give you cancer. Okay? The ashtray does not actually contribute to your injury. What you have is you have a toxic product that you're making a choice to use that you are putting down. It would be like saying this -- and I think it's a great example for us because it highlights why we are not saying they're responsible for every harm from asbestos, including this asbestos. It would be like us saying: Your machine only works with asbestos; you're liable because I got sick because the storage room had the asbestos in it. We're not just saying kind of but-for causation that there was a relationship between them. You can put your cancer-causing cigarette down in the ashtray and not be liable for it, but if it is the case -- I'll give you an example. What if the ashtray is made of paper? Okay? If the ashtray is made of paper, so that if you put something lit in it, they will cause -- it will cause combustion and it will burn --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: No, but that's different because then your product, the actual product that you're manufacturing, is dangerous.</turn>\n<turn>Thomas C.

Notwithstanding that the court had found grave risk, could it nonetheless say, yes, we're going to send the child back because there are sufficient ameliorative measures?

And I guess the second question is you -- you know the record better than I do, and you've read the various opinions more closely than I have. Do you think that the district court -- like, what do you think that the prospects are that the district court would want to do that?

In other words, if you want as much of the fetus intact and out as possible, why wait, stop it halfway? Wouldn't the safety argument suggest delivery of the fetus?</turn>\n<turn>Priscilla J.

That's the point, Your Honor, is that the fetus is obstructed and so the overt act that takes place is--</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: In the case of a vertex delivery, where is the obstruction?</turn>\n<turn>Priscilla J. Smith: --The obstruction would come from a distension of the abdomen, usually from a fetal anomaly like a sides, which is, this is a serious anomaly. It's lethal anomalies that I was talking about. And in those circumstances, an overt act would need to be performed that would in fact cause fetal demise before the fetus could be, the delivery could be continued.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M.

What, what the Court held in Stenberg in applying the appropriate medical judgment standard of Casey, was that there had to be a substantial body of medical opinion, an objective standard that in fact supports the use of that procedure. And that both, that balances concerns against protecting a woman's health with a concern of unfettered discretion, which the Court has rejected.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M.

Even if there is severability, there is still a Civil Investigative Demand that was issued by a director who at the time was unaccountable. And this Court's cases, Bowsher, Lucia, and others, make clear that when you have an action taken by an unaccountable official or an official who is, you know, either improperly appointed or is subject to an improper removal restriction, that action is void full stop.

But I think, second, to the extent that we're talking about Congress's goal here, there is abundant evidence that what Congress was trying to do was to create an agency that precisely, because of its desire to protect consumers, was insulated from political control to the fullest extent possible. As Elizabeth Warren, who was really the progenitor of the CFPB, said at the time, if Congress did not create an agency with functional independence, \"my second choice is no agency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left on the floor.\" And so, if this Court is considering what the hypothetical Congress -- what Congress would have hypothetically wanted at the time of the Dodd-Frank Act, I don't think that what Congress would have wanted was the creation of an agency that was fully subject to the President's control.</turn>\n</context>\n<justice>Justice John G.

(Laughter.)</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: That 230 years in this -- in this country's history, we have respected acquittals without looking into their substance and without looking into how they fit with other counts and said a jury is a check on judges, it's a check on prosecutors, it's a check on overreach, it's part of our democratic system, and we do not ever talk about whether they make sense to us. They may be products of compromise. They may be inconsistent with verdicts on other counts. We don't question them. And this is the first time this issue has arisen here. Shouldn't that tell us something?</turn>\n<turn>Stephen J. Petrany: I don't think so, Your Honor. As we point out in our briefs, the fact that Georgia has a different rule from other states -- and, again, I would hasten to add it's not clear that the rule is different so much as other states just haven't addressed this issue. In a lot of states, you might not have the same sort of defenses or states of mind that would so easily come into conflict, although, again, here, I think this is a rare circumstance. But, to get to your point, absolutely, a jury's general verdict of acquittal is one of the most sacrosanct things in American constitutional law, and we're not trying to undermine that at all. But I do think it's important to point out that that's simply not what happened here. They had the option to do that, and, instead, they gave completely contradictory answers about a single factual question.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Well, and -- and that raises the question about Missouri's brief, for example, and their concern seems to be within a single count that some states do that, the case I had, you know, where you just couldn't tell what the jury's verdict was on a count and send the jury back to figure it out.

It's not ordinary for a jury to issue special findings on a particular issue --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: I'm -- I'm -- I'm just --</turn>\n<turn>Stephen J. Petrany: -- going both ways, but, yes --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: -- generally speaking.</turn>\n<turn>Stephen J. Petrany: -- you are -- as far as I know, there's no --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: This is it?</turn>\n<turn>Stephen J. Petrany: -- other state that has addressed this issue at all.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Now shouldn't that tell us something? (Laughter.)</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: That 230 years in this -- in this country's history, we have respected acquittals without looking into their substance and without looking into how they fit with other counts and said a jury is a check on judges, it's a check on prosecutors, it's a check on overreach, it's part of our democratic system, and we do not ever talk about whether they make sense to us. They may be products of compromise. They may be inconsistent with verdicts on other counts. We don't question them. And this is the first time this issue has arisen here. Shouldn't that tell us something?</turn>\n<turn>Stephen J. Petrany: I don't think so, Your Honor. As we point out in our briefs, the fact that Georgia has a different rule from other states -- and, again, I would hasten to add it's not clear that the rule is different so much as other states just haven't addressed this issue. In a lot of states, you might not have the same sort of defenses or states of mind that would so easily come into conflict, although, again, here, I think this is a rare circumstance. But, to get to your point, absolutely, a jury's general verdict of acquittal is one of the most sacrosanct things in American constitutional law, and we're not trying to undermine that at all. But I do think it's important to point out that that's simply not what happened here. They had the option to do that, and, instead, they gave completely contradictory answers about a single factual question.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Well, and -- and that raises the question about Missouri's brief, for example, and their concern seems to be within a single count that some states do that, the case I had, you know, where you just couldn't tell what the jury's verdict was on a count and send the jury back to figure it out. None of that's at stake here, right?</turn>\n<turn>Stephen J. Petrany: Well, I think the principle of the matter arguably extends there. I mean, I --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: You'd have to extend it. But it isn't at issue here?</turn>\n<turn>Stephen J. Petrany: Well, I think -- I think the logic is the same. The only difference between here and --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: No, the logic isn't the same. I mean, I'm sorry, I just have to reject that. Assume I disagree with that --</turn>\n<turn>Stephen J. Petrany: Okay.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: -- because the logic for 230 years is a verdict on a count is sacrosanct, okay? Here, we're dealing with not -- not two counts, we're dealing with one count, and we cannot tell what the jury did. The judge doesn't know what to do. He doesn't have his instructions from the jury.</turn>\n<turn>Stephen J. Petrany: Well, Your Honor, I want to be clear about the 230 years. Every time the Court has talked about this and every time the Court has made rulings about this, it's always talking about a general verdict of acquittal. It's not talking about a circumstance where you have special findings that did not have the same sort of status, the same sort of --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Why does that make a difference? An acquittal is an acquittal is an acquittal --</turn>\n<turn>Stephen J.

And the district court's opinion on page 200 makes very clear that is an alternative theory of criminal liability. It's not just hiring the person; it was also the advice that was given.

It won't always be the case. It's the easiest thing in the world for a defendant to say, I just didn't know, or even if I did know at one point that my crime was punishable by more than one year, I forgot. Imagine a defendant who received a 10-month sentence.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: But juries don't --</turn>\n<turn>Allon Kedem: Despite --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M.

So -- so we're dealing with two classes of cases then if I understand your argument. One is it's going to be easy to prove in the mine run of cases. It's not going to a big deal. But there is a small but significant number of cases where, gee, it's really going to be a colorable question and, therefore, a burden on the government.</turn>\n<turn>Allon Kedem: Our point --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: It seems to me a double-edged sword, isn't it?</turn>\n<turn>Allon Kedem: So -- so our argument is not that it's a burden on the government. Sometimes it will be, but usually it won't. And, in any event, we're not asking for your sympathy. Our point is that you risk shifting the focus of all felon-in-possession trials out of -- out of a concern for a category of cases that, if they exist, is extraordinarily small.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: That does seem like you're asking for our sympathy, with all respect.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M.

And now we're left with these.</turn>\n<turn>Allon Kedem: So, again, the problem is not the burden on the government.

Roberts, Jr.: Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh?</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: On the least change point that you mentioned, my understanding, but I want to get your understanding of the record, was that Senator Campsen wanted Beaufort and Berkeley Counties to be kept whole, he wanted a stronger Republican tilt, and he wanted Representative Clyburn to represent some of Charleston County because of Representative Clyburn's clout in the -- in the Congress and with the administration. So, if you -- if those things are accurate -- and I just want your understanding of the record -- then doesn't that mean you couldn't draw the first district without some significant changes?</turn>\n<turn>Leah C. Aden: Those are generally the findings of the court, but the court recognized and detailed in its opinion that when Beaufort, when Berkeley, when Dorchester were brought in, they had Black neighbors, and those Black neighbors increased the BVAP in CD1 to a politically risky 20 percent and Black Charlestonians were offset. Black people were treated one-to-one, traded one in, one out. White voters, the Republican-leaning ones, were individualized and allowed to come into CD1, and white Democrats were even kept in or individualized and allowed to remain in CD1. It's only Black people in the design of this district that were treated with racial stereotyping, which is offensive to this -- the Constitution.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Right. I understand that principle, of course. But West Ashley was predominantly white and predominantly Democratic and then was moved out, right?</turn>\n<turn>Leah C. Aden: Yes, but there were significant, still heavily Black precincts --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Right.</turn>\n<turn>Leah C. Aden: -- that were moved out alongside of it. And the court addressed this matter --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Your point is there's a higher percentage then of Blacks than whites moved out?</turn>\n<turn>Leah C. Aden: And -- and that the court --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Is that right?</turn>\n<turn>Leah C. Aden: That is correct.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Because there were a lot of white people moved out of District 1 in West --</turn>\n<turn>Leah C. Aden: That is correct. And the court confronted the net effect argument in its opinion. And when you look at the paragraph about Deer Park, it talks about how you may have a precinct that has 10,000 white people in it and another precinct that has 8500 Black people in it, still a minority but still substantial, and the movement of those precincts would notwithstanding affect the overall BVAP of a district. And that's exactly what the court considered and confronted. This is not a new argument being raised. It was considered by the court and it was rejected in its racial gerrymandering finding.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: The other side makes a point that the original plan that came from Representative Clyburn's office actually had a lower Black voting population for District 1 than what ultimately emerged. I just want to get your response to that, the relevance of that in the overall record.</turn>\n<turn>Leah C. Aden: I think it's irrelevant because I don't think that his map determined the -- the sorting that was actually done by the key decisionmakers that the court acknowledged. But even more, if you look to the amici brief that Representative Clyburn's office offers in this case, they provided a partial map, and then, from there, the state drew out the -- a partial map of one district and, from there, drew out the other six districts. So we have no idea what the BVAP of CD1 would be based upon what the record reflects Representative Clyburn was seeking in CD6.

If we thought it didn't rang -- ring hollow, would that be a basis for clear error? Do I not understand what the clear error standard is?</turn>\n<turn>Leah C. Aden: I don't believe that you do.

Kavanaugh: On the least change point that you mentioned, my understanding, but I want to get your understanding of the record, was that Senator Campsen wanted Beaufort and Berkeley Counties to be kept whole, he wanted a stronger Republican tilt, and he wanted Representative Clyburn to represent some of Charleston County because of Representative Clyburn's clout in the -- in the Congress and with the administration. So, if you -- if those things are accurate -- and I just want your understanding of the record -- then doesn't that mean you couldn't draw the first district without some significant changes?</turn>\n<turn>Leah C. Aden: Those are generally the findings of the court, but the court recognized and detailed in its opinion that when Beaufort, when Berkeley, when Dorchester were brought in, they had Black neighbors, and those Black neighbors increased the BVAP in CD1 to a politically risky 20 percent and Black Charlestonians were offset. Black people were treated one-to-one, traded one in, one out. White voters, the Republican-leaning ones, were individualized and allowed to come into CD1, and white Democrats were even kept in or individualized and allowed to remain in CD1. It's only Black people in the design of this district that were treated with racial stereotyping, which is offensive to this -- the Constitution.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Right. I understand that principle, of course. But West Ashley was predominantly white and predominantly Democratic and then was moved out, right?</turn>\n<turn>Leah C. Aden: Yes, but there were significant, still heavily Black precincts --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Right.</turn>\n<turn>Leah C. Aden: -- that were moved out alongside of it. And the court addressed this matter --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Your point is there's a higher percentage then of Blacks than whites moved out?</turn>\n<turn>Leah C. Aden: And -- and that the court --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Is that right?</turn>\n<turn>Leah C. Aden: That is correct.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Because there were a lot of white people moved out of District 1 in West --</turn>\n<turn>Leah C. Aden: That is correct. And the court confronted the net effect argument in its opinion. And when you look at the paragraph about Deer Park, it talks about how you may have a precinct that has 10,000 white people in it and another precinct that has 8500 Black people in it, still a minority but still substantial, and the movement of those precincts would notwithstanding affect the overall BVAP of a district. And that's exactly what the court considered and confronted. This is not a new argument being raised. It was considered by the court and it was rejected in its racial gerrymandering finding.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: The other side makes a point that the original plan that came from Representative Clyburn's office actually had a lower Black voting population for District 1 than what ultimately emerged. I just want to get your response to that, the relevance of that in the overall record.</turn>\n<turn>Leah C. Aden: I think it's irrelevant because I don't think that his map determined the -- the sorting that was actually done by the key decisionmakers that the court acknowledged. But even more, if you look to the amici brief that Representative Clyburn's office offers in this case, they provided a partial map, and then, from there, the state drew out the -- a partial map of one district and, from there, drew out the other six districts. So we have no idea what the BVAP of CD1 would be based upon what the record reflects Representative Clyburn was seeking in CD6. And that is detailed in the amici brief that he submitted.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Yeah. Thank you.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Barrett? Justice Jackson?</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: So I guess I'm still struggling with this clear error standard and the application in this context. Justice Alito asked a number of questions about the reasons that the district court highlighted for why it did not credit Mr. Roberts' testimony. And I guess, consistent with what I understood the clear error standard to require of us, I didn't know that we were to evaluate whether we agreed or disagreed with each of their findings, whether we would have found -- you know, had a different takeaway from the fact that, you know, his testimony, the district court said it -- it rang hollow. If we thought it didn't rang -- ring hollow, would that be a basis for clear error? Do I not understand what the clear error standard is?</turn>\n<turn>Leah C. Aden: I don't believe that you do. I believe that the credibility determinations, the ability for the court, as in White v. Regester, as in Cooper, to have listened to the witnesses, is clearly given much deference by this Court, that the racial gerrymandering finding is a clear error finding and the subsidiary findings --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: Right, but -- and the subsidiary findings --</turn>\n<turn>Leah C.

But, when we're reviewing them, we're not supposed to be doing a do-over, right? We're not supposed to be saying, well, if I had been sitting there, I would have found that his testimony rang hollow, so I'm going to reverse. Isn't that the nature of clear error?<|eot_id|>"}

And that's the question he posed.</turn>\n<turn>David D.

There's two --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: If you wish to address it.</turn>\n<turn>David D. Cole: Two -- two -- two answers to that, Your Honor. First, on the question of judicial interpretation, we are not asking you to apply any meaning of sex other than the one that everybody agrees on as of 1964, which is sex assigned at birth or, as -- as they put it, biological sex. We're not asking you to rewrite it. Second --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: I agree with that.</turn>\n<turn>David D. Cole: Second --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: The question, though, again, and I'm sorry to pose it --</turn>\n<turn>David D. Cole: Yeah.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: -- but I'm going to give you one more shot.</turn>\n<turn>David D. Cole: Yeah.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Right? When a case is really close, really close, on the textual evidence, and I -- assume for the moment I'm --</turn>\n<turn>David D. Cole: Yeah.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: -- I'm with you on the textual evidence. It's close, okay? We're not talking about extra-textual stuff. We're -- we're talking about the text. It's close. The judge finds it very close. At the end of the day, should he or she take into consideration the massive social upheaval that would be entailed in such a decision, and the possibility that -- that Congress didn't think about it --</turn>\n<turn>David D. Cole: So --</turn>\n</context>\n<justice>Justice Neil Gorsuch</justice>\nGenerate a question that Justice Neil Gorsuch is likely to ask next.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch: -- and -- and -- and the fact that there are -- that there are competing interests on the other side, including the fact that there are transgendered people who prefer living according to the -- the -- the biological sex assigned at birth. And there are other arguments, one could make, about bathrooms, about locker rooms, about dress codes. Those are tough policy questions. And the other side says they're really important questions, and they're fair questions, and they should be left to Congress, and the courts should stay out of it, or at the very least recognize that it's a close question either way.<|eot_id|>"}

But let's put those aside for the moment and just look at the APA itself. Isn't it a little odd that -- that Section 706 governs the scope of review and proceeds to tell us to review questions of law de novo, and that's a whole other kettle of fish, whether we do that, but tells us to do that and then goes on and tells us, when we find an unlawful agency action, finding, or conclusion, we should set it aside. We don't think of negating or vacating or erasing findings or conclusions. We -- we -- we put them aside and go ahead and decide the case without them usually. Why -- why wouldn't the same apply to -- to errors of law under a de novo standard of review, especially when 703 does list all the remedial forms available in an APA action, declaratory judgment, injunctions? It -- it would seem like it would be a monster swallowing all of the other remedies that -- that sits in these five words, you know, hold unlawful and set aside. It's in a scope of review section. It's -- just on its face, putting aside our learned friends on the D.C. Circuit on the one hand and our learned friends from the Sixth and the Fourth on the other.</turn>\n<turn>Judd E. Stone, II: So I think the answer, Your Honor, is to look at both 703 and 706 together. I disagree with you that 703 provides remedies, and I think taken sentence by sentence, it's just that it doesn't --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Well, take a look at it again, counsel, and tell me if you really think that, because I look at it, and it talks about venue and forms of proceeding, and the forms of proceeding listed include injunctive relief and declaratory judgments. Those are classic remedial forms of relief or forms of proceeding.</turn>\n<turn>Judd E. Stone, II: Well, Your Honor, two points. First of all, I don't think anyone has ever thought that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 2, which provides one form of action -- and this is the same words you here used, form of proceeding -- and it specifies --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: That's different.</turn>\n<turn>Judd E. Stone, II: -- the applicable legal form of action. I don't think anyone thinks --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Forms of proceeding and it lists them as declaratory and injunctive.

So those are remedies, declaratory relief, injunctions. There they are in 703. So it's a little odd that there'd be those giant remedies that swallow the whole of 703 lurking over in 706. And then put -- put that aside too. What about 702, which limits the power of certain persons to come into court under the APA, limits them to aggrieved persons who have actually been personally and concretely injured? There, Congress is carefully respecting our standing rules at the front end. Wouldn't it be odd for it to blow a giant hole in our traditional remedial rules at the back end through five words in 706?</turn>\n<turn>Judd E. Stone, II: I don't think so, Your Honor. Two points, the first being this Court has recognized, I believe in Lujan in 1990, that the APA provides an especially generous sort -- form of judicial review.

In fact, this Court's decision in Bowles involved the extension for good cause. So the question here for the Secretary -- and, again, this is just a narrow question of good cause.

The State is in no way trying to take anything from the third party settlement proceeds that represents... that represents payment for anything other than what is necessary to reimburse the State for that amount of money.</turn>\n<turn>Justice David H. Souter: But you're... you're basing your argument on this statute.</turn>\n<turn>Lori Freno: Yes.</turn>\n<turn>Justice David H. Souter: And let me come back to my question. This statute simply says that she will assign her rights to recover for the medicals. She has done that. She has also given you the portion of the settlement which she and you agree is attributable to the medicals. Why isn't the statute satisfied if she simply says, you've got your assignment? If you want the difference between what I've given you and your out of pocket expense, sue. You have the assignment. You have the right. Go ahead and sue for it.</turn>\n<turn>Lori Freno: Because she assigned, Your Honor, her right to recover... or her right for payments from third parties, she no longer has the right to compromise the State's claim. Ms.... the respondent does not have--</turn>\n<turn>Justice David H. Souter: Well, it seems to me that that is an entirely different argument. The question is what does the statute require her to do and entitle you to do. And I don't see why, under the statute, the statute is not satisfied if you simply sue for the difference under... under your assignment of her rights.</turn>\n<turn>Lori Freno: --There's... under the statute, her assignment... she has a duty of cooperation, first of all, to cooperate with the State in receiving these recoveries. The assignment allows her to bring a lawsuit. It does not require her to bring a lawsuit. Primarily the obligation is on the State to sue--</turn>\n<turn>Justice David H. Souter: Doesn't the assignment allow you to bring a lawsuit?</turn>\n<turn>Lori Freno: --Yes, the assignment allows--</turn>\n<turn>Justice David H. Souter: Then why don't you bring it?

Suppose it's a very weak case and the litigant says I want to settle for 20 cents on the dollar. Are you saying that there's some kind of duty to notify the State and... and to consult with the State before this is done?</turn>\n<turn>Lori Freno: --Yes, Your Honor, and that is encompassed within State law.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: Okay. Suppose the... the State says, well, we... we don't... we don't agree with you. Then... then what happens? Then they're at loggerheads and you go to Justice Souter's position I suppose.</turn>\n<turn>Lori Freno: In that situation, then the... the case would just have to go forward to litigation. And yes, the State, if it wished to pursue--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: Would... would it... if... suppose in the instance I put they... the... the State has... has an objection, but the settlement is made, nonetheless, for 20 cents on the dollar.

I'm sorry.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: Assume that it's a very weak case. They settle for 20 cents on the dollar. Do you have the right, as you understand the law, to insist that you receive 100 percent of your payments from the gross settlement?</turn>\n<turn>Lori Freno: The... the Medicaid recipient can never compromise the claim of the State.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M.

That holding is wrong and should be reversed. A law is content-based on its face when the text of the law singles out specific subject matter for differential treatment. The law in Reed did that by distinguishing ideological, political, and directional signs. A rule regulating off-premises advertising does not.

I want to emphasize at the outset that we think that DHS is relying permissibly on its express statutory release authorities here. So it's the parole authority you mentioned in 1182(d)(5). It's also the authority to grant bond or conditional parole under Section 1226(a), which is a provision that Respondents largely ignore. So we think that the releases are consistent with those express authorities, and we think that the language in 1225(b)(2)(A), the \"shall be detained\" language that you referenced, should be interpreted against the backdrop of long-standing principles of enforcement discretion, in recognition that this is essentially a limited law enforcement resource. No one disputes that DHS does not have sufficient capacity to detain everyone who could be subject to detention under that provision. But I should say also that if you disagree with everything that I just said or think that there is more room for doubt about how DHS implements those detention and release authorities, still I don't think that provides any license to rewrite Section 1225(b)(2)(C) in contravention of its plain language.

And that's fine, I would say. You're -- one way to look at it is you're sort of taking away from yourself an option to comply with the statute.

Those provisions from the beginning have typically --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: These are the same shareholders as in Subpart F.</turn>\n<turn>Andrew M. Grossman: The difference is that those provisions have typically addressed things like passive income and related party transactions that are properly attributable to, say, a parent corporation. In other words, a parent corporation could own an income-generating asset itself, or it could simply shift that into a corporation, into a foreign corporation, and thereby avoid the income. And what the law has recognized is that just as in cases like Horst and Banks, that's effectively an assignment of income and that -- and that it can be attributed to the -- to the person who -- the parent corporation for that reason because the parent corporation is the one that controls the flow of the income as it's coming in. The MRT, by contrast, operates as a tax on property. It doesn't take account of any power that the shareholder had over the income as it was coming in the door to the corporation. It only takes account of the ownership in 2022.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: That seems to be an argument about timing. In other words, we have realization in this case. The entity realized income. The question then is attribution, and we've long held that Congress may attribute the income of the company to the shareholders or the partnership to the partners, and the only real wrinkle, I think, here is that it goes back and captures prior years' income.</turn>\n<turn>Andrew M. Grossman: I think there are two -- two wrinkles. One is that, with respect to those prior years, the statute doesn't require that the shareholders being taxed had any ability to control the disposition of the income in those years. That's a fundamental distinction. The second is that Subpart F --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: That's not true for the facts of this case, though, correct?</turn>\n<turn>Andrew M. Grossman: It is not true for the facts of this case, but -- but --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: But you're saying generally. Yeah.</turn>\n<turn>Andrew M. Grossman: Well, I think -- I think it just demonstrates that this is a tax on property. In other words, do you own something on a particular date, as opposed to what do you do with the past? Did you have that power in the past? But, second, the provisions --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: If it had been taxed year by year, would that have been permissible?</turn>\n<turn>Andrew M. Grossman: No, and that's the second wrinkle, so to speak. In this -- the -- the MRT is sort -- is the inverse of what -- of its press -- of its predecessors in the statutes. All the predecessors, like the foreign personal holding company provisions, as well as Subpart F, focus on categories of income. They're susceptible to being reassigned into the corporate form.

What's interesting is that Subpart F says you've captured the field, now let's get everything else, and the \"everything else\" is the active business income that's attributable solely to the foreign corporation's own legitimate business activities overseas. And so a -- the shareholder in a foreign corporation stands in no different position with respect to that income than a shareholder in, say, Microsoft or any other corporation.

I also want to address just the difficulties that the government's interpretation would raise with respect to the current Tax Code.

Grossman: It isn't. Those provisions from the beginning have typically --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: These are the same shareholders as in Subpart F.</turn>\n<turn>Andrew M. Grossman: The difference is that those provisions have typically addressed things like passive income and related party transactions that are properly attributable to, say, a parent corporation. In other words, a parent corporation could own an income-generating asset itself, or it could simply shift that into a corporation, into a foreign corporation, and thereby avoid the income. And what the law has recognized is that just as in cases like Horst and Banks, that's effectively an assignment of income and that -- and that it can be attributed to the -- to the person who -- the parent corporation for that reason because the parent corporation is the one that controls the flow of the income as it's coming in. The MRT, by contrast, operates as a tax on property. It doesn't take account of any power that the shareholder had over the income as it was coming in the door to the corporation. It only takes account of the ownership in 2022.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: That seems to be an argument about timing. In other words, we have realization in this case. The entity realized income. The question then is attribution, and we've long held that Congress may attribute the income of the company to the shareholders or the partnership to the partners, and the only real wrinkle, I think, here is that it goes back and captures prior years' income.</turn>\n<turn>Andrew M. Grossman: I think there are two -- two wrinkles. One is that, with respect to those prior years, the statute doesn't require that the shareholders being taxed had any ability to control the disposition of the income in those years. That's a fundamental distinction. The second is that Subpart F --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: That's not true for the facts of this case, though, correct?</turn>\n<turn>Andrew M. Grossman: It is not true for the facts of this case, but -- but --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: But you're saying generally. Yeah.</turn>\n<turn>Andrew M. Grossman: Well, I think -- I think it just demonstrates that this is a tax on property. In other words, do you own something on a particular date, as opposed to what do you do with the past? Did you have that power in the past? But, second, the provisions --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: If it had been taxed year by year, would that have been permissible?</turn>\n<turn>Andrew M. Grossman: No, and that's the second wrinkle, so to speak. In this -- the -- the MRT is sort -- is the inverse of what -- of its press -- of its predecessors in the statutes. All the predecessors, like the foreign personal holding company provisions, as well as Subpart F, focus on categories of income. They're susceptible to being reassigned into the corporate form. Congress has never reached so far as to tax shareholders of foreign corporations on the active business income of those corporations, but --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M.

And so you're just reading the word \"qualified\" out of the statute if you read it that way.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: \"Qualified\" is used in the -- in the lay sense of the term, it's not a technical term here.</turn>\n<turn>Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.: Well, I -- I think -- well, given the way it's defined, it's defined as a person who resides in the State. It excludes people out of State. It does that because the statute was quite clear that you weren't going to be allowed to shop for insurance policies across State lines because that would infringe on traditional State prerogatives regulating insurance. And it -- and with respect to prisoners, it doesn't make any sense to say that prisoners should be able to get insurance. Mr. Carvin says, yes, it does because they get out of prison. Well, there's a specific statutory provision that says when you face a changed-life circumstance, such as getting out of prison, you can sign up for insurance at that point. He makes the point about unlawfully present persons being both unqualified and not being able to be covered, but that's not -- that's not surplus, that's there for a very important reason, which is that someone can be in lawful status and, therefore, be eligible for health care, but then lose lawful status and at that point, they can no longer be covered. So, just none of that works for them. None of that works for them. And -- but to -- really, to get to the fundamental point here that both at the level of text, you have clear irresolvable conflicts so that the statute can't work if you read it Mr. Carvin's way.

And the question is how it's going to operate. And when you read it their way, you --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: Well, if it's -- if it's ambiguous, then we think about Chevron. But it seems to me a drastic step for us to say that the Department of Internal Revenue and its director can make this call one way or the other when there are, what, billions of dollars of subsidies involved here? Hundreds of millions?</turn>\n<turn>Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.: Yes, there are billions of dollars of subsidies involved here. But two points about that --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M.

But before you get to that, you can resolve and should resolve this statute and the statute's meaning in our favor even without resort to Chevron deference.

If you think there's a constitutional problem with the statute, it's what the doctrine of constitutional avoidance directs you to do. Now, with respect to Chevron, Section 36B(g) of the statute expressly delegates to the IRS the specific authority to make any decisions necessary to implement Section 36B. So you don't have any ambiguity. Congress said the IRS should do this. It is a big question, but as the Court said in City of Arlington two terms ago, Chevron applies to big questions as well as small. Your Honor raised this point about the need for clarity in -- in a tax deduction and IRS in the statutory reading of tax deductions, there is a learned treatise that describes that as a false notion.

But I can't square your position with Flores-Ortega because Flores-Ortega seemed to accept as a working proposition that given that there is even, in a guilty plea, there are waivers of some issues but not others, that the question of whether a defendant would have appealed takes into account the plea waiver at that stage, but once a defendant tells an attorney to appeal, that's his choice.

And --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Exactly. But -- but you're assuming the answer in the exact same way, aren't you? What is or is not a qualification sort of depends on this case. So I don't think that you can get rid of Mr. Lessig so easily as you would like to.</turn>\n<turn>Philip J.

Justice Gorsuch?</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Counsel, I'd like to continue the same line of questioning that Justice Kagan raised with you and -- and Mr. Lessig suggested. If -- if states enjoy plenary power to remove electors, what would prohibit them from passing a law to say -- for example, to say that -- that all electors have to -- have to vote for presidents -- presidential candidates who support certain positions or who have done certain things or who have visited the state. Now I understand your ex post argument; that is, states can't change the rules of the election after the election and have to provide voters notice. But, if they did it well in advance, what would prohibit them from doing so, if anything, on your view?</turn>\n<turn>Philip J. Weiser: Your Honor, I'm trying to square how this fits with a popular vote system because, if you give people the power to vote and they exercise the power, then our argument is you count their votes. What I believe you'd be getting at would then be a preclearance process where you'd have to preclear what electors could be on the ballot before people could vote on them. In that system --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Well --</turn>\n<turn>Philip J. Weiser: Yes.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: -- just to interrupt you, I'm sorry, counsel, but you've -- you've indicated it would be fine for people to have an advisory vote to 12 wise people who would then make the final decision. Why -- why couldn't you also have a system in which the people provide advice within certain parameters set by the legislature?</turn>\n<turn>Philip J. Weiser: Your Honor, I think that's the same context I had in mind, which is you would basically give people an advisory vote and then, after the fact, you'd have to ask whether the --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: No, not after the fact. They've been alerted prior to the fact, counsel. That's my hypothetical. I -- I -- I understand your point about after the fact. In advance, they've been notified that there are -- they are free to provide advice to -- to -- to -- to 12 electors, whatever the number may be, and their advice, though, is going to be bounded and there are certain things that the electors have to -- have to, because the legislature says, abide by or else they'll be removed. And those are, again, you know, has the presidential candidate visited the state, has he taken this or that position, has he or she, you know, turned over her tax returns? Whatever -- whatever the conditions may be. It's a bounded choice. You've been arguing that choice can be bounded. And this is just another bounds. What prohibits the State from doing that?</turn>\n<turn>Philip J. Weiser: In this situation, the State can add limitations as long as they comply with other constitutional provisions.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: And do those?</turn>\n<turn>Philip J. Weiser: The requirement to visit a state I don't believe clearly violates any constitutional provision.

I mean, it's obviously a pretty normal understanding of -- of what elections do. But, if you assume that these electors were meant to -- to use their own discretion, then the popular vote was not required and -- and it would be imposing a qualification.</turn>\n<turn>Philip J. Weiser: Your Honor, if you assume electors have this discretion, you've assumed the answer to this case. We would say they don't have that discretion at all. And --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Exactly. But -- but you're assuming the answer in the exact same way, aren't you? What is or is not a qualification sort of depends on this case. So I don't think that you can get rid of Mr. Lessig so easily as you would like to.</turn>\n<turn>Philip J. Weiser: Your Honor, our position is that the Constitution is silent on whether or not you can have electors representing how the public votes. That is inherent in this design, and, thus, we say what's inherent in the design couldn't be an additional qualification.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch?</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Counsel, I'd like to continue the same line of questioning that Justice Kagan raised with you and -- and Mr. Lessig suggested. If -- if states enjoy plenary power to remove electors, what would prohibit them from passing a law to say -- for example, to say that -- that all electors have to -- have to vote for presidents -- presidential candidates who support certain positions or who have done certain things or who have visited the state. Now I understand your ex post argument; that is, states can't change the rules of the election after the election and have to provide voters notice. But, if they did it well in advance, what would prohibit them from doing so, if anything, on your view?</turn>\n<turn>Philip J. Weiser: Your Honor, I'm trying to square how this fits with a popular vote system because, if you give people the power to vote and they exercise the power, then our argument is you count their votes. What I believe you'd be getting at would then be a preclearance process where you'd have to preclear what electors could be on the ballot before people could vote on them. In that system --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Well --</turn>\n<turn>Philip J. Weiser: Yes.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: -- just to interrupt you, I'm sorry, counsel, but you've -- you've indicated it would be fine for people to have an advisory vote to 12 wise people who would then make the final decision. Why -- why couldn't you also have a system in which the people provide advice within certain parameters set by the legislature?</turn>\n<turn>Philip J. Weiser: Your Honor, I think that's the same context I had in mind, which is you would basically give people an advisory vote and then, after the fact, you'd have to ask whether the --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: No, not after the fact. They've been alerted prior to the fact, counsel. That's my hypothetical. I -- I -- I understand your point about after the fact. In advance, they've been notified that there are -- they are free to provide advice to -- to -- to -- to 12 electors, whatever the number may be, and their advice, though, is going to be bounded and there are certain things that the electors have to -- have to, because the legislature says, abide by or else they'll be removed. And those are, again, you know, has the presidential candidate visited the state, has he taken this or that position, has he or she, you know, turned over her tax returns? Whatever -- whatever the conditions may be. It's a bounded choice. You've been arguing that choice can be bounded. And this is just another bounds. What prohibits the State from doing that?</turn>\n<turn>Philip J. Weiser: In this situation, the State can add limitations as long as they comply with other constitutional provisions.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: And do those?</turn>\n<turn>Philip J. Weiser: The requirement to visit a state I don't believe clearly violates any constitutional provision. The tax return issue, we've noted, raises a Qualification Clause question that could be a real concern. And the --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: So the presidential candidate is on the ballot. It's who the electors can vote for. Is that a qualifications problem in the State's view?</turn>\n<turn>Philip J.

The claim that isolated DNA is a human invention rests entirely on the fact that it is no longer connected at the molecular level to what surrounded it in the body. But allowing a patent on that basis would effectively preempt anyone else from using the gene itself for any medical or scientific purpose. That is not true about a patent on cDNA.

Assuming all the other factors in this case were present--</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Yes.</turn>\n<turn>Kent L. Richland: --That is, he is using his department-issued pager; he is a police officer and indeed a member of the high-profile SWAT team of the police department. He should be aware just by virtue of that fact that there is going to be litigation involving incidents that the SWAT team gets involved in where there will be requests for the communications that are made on that official department-issued pager. And, in addition, he should be aware of the fact -- and this is something that the dissenters to denial of en banc said below. He should be aware that there may be inquiries from boards of the police to determine whether the conduct of the police in a particular incident is appropriate.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Mr. Richland, a little earlier you referred us to page 152 and 156 of--</turn>\n<turn>Kent L.

That is the written policy, Justice Scalia. I'm sorry for the confusion.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, that's the written policy.</turn>\n<turn>Kent L.

Breyer: I'm not saying it's not a tax. I'm simply asking how do they get judicial review without paying the tax -- the penalty, which I'll call a tax, how do they get judicial review of the lawfulness of the order that says -- or the report that says give us the information? How do they do it?</turn>\n<turn>Jonathan C. Bond: They have to engage in the conduct that they say -- that they believe to be lawful. They simply know that the government disagrees with that. And until the Declaratory Judgment Act, that was the normal way litigation proceeded.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: No, I don't understand it. You'll have to do it more slowly. I'm sorry. They follow the report and give you the information. Okay, that's what you're saying?</turn>\n<turn>Jonathan C. Bond: No, Your Honor. What they do is they file their ordinary tax return or, in the case of a material advisor, they just send us a letter objecting to providing this information.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: And do they -- do they -- do they give you the information or not?</turn>\n<turn>Jonathan C. Bond: No, they withhold the information and would seek to --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: They withhold the information. Therefore, they have violated the reporting requirement. Therefore, they are subject to paying an enormous fine called a tax. That's what they don't want to do.</turn>\n<turn>Jonathan C. Bond: So I'd say two things, Your Honor. First, if they are right that their conduct is, in fact, lawful because they disagree with us about that, then, when they get their judicial determination, the result will be that they never violated the law. Our view is different, and they run that risk. But, if they are right about the underlying merits, they will --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: So that's the answer to my question.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Thank you. Justice -- Justice Alito.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: The code says that willfully failing to comply with the reporting requirement is a crime. So I really don't see how they can get review without committing a crime.</turn>\n<turn>Jonathan C. Bond: And I think the answer is in this Court's decisions in Sullivan and subsequently in Garner, where the Court said in -- in both the precursor of 7203 and 7203, that it is not a willful violation to file a return or to subject yourself to examination and assert your good-faith objection to providing the information.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, why is it not a willful violation? Under Cheek, it's certainly willful. They say, look, I understand that under this guidance and under IRS regulations I'm required to do this, but I sincerely believe that it's unlawful. Isn't that exactly the situation in Cheek, where somebody says I'm not going to file a tax return, although I know that the Internal Revenue Code requires me to file a tax return, but I sincerely believe that the Internal Revenue Code and the Internal Revenue Service are unconstitutional. I don't see the difference.</turn>\n<turn>Jonathan C. Bond: Well, I'd say a couple of things. First, Cheek -- Cheek in Footnote 10 expressly distinguished the kind of procedure that we're describing from Sullivan and later cases. It cites a case called Murdock that is to the same effect. The second, to the line you're drawing between -- you're suggesting between saying the action is unlawful versus I don't believe I'm actually required to do it, I don't think that line works in Petitioner's favor here. Petitioner's argument at bottom is that it is not required to provide this information because the statute only requires it to submit information covered by regulations. And, here, the IRS has not issued a valid regulation. I think Petitioner's argument falls on the first side of that line.

And I apologize, but this will -- this -- my time. Count this against my time. And it unduly read it -- it didn't read the statute as it's now written. It read it influenced by the background regulation and -- and to the point where it said even a judicial opinion doesn't qualify in these circumstances. Let's say we agree with you that, yes, that's a clear and unmistakable error. Wagner was one. All right. Fine.</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L.

Bostwick: Certainly. You could say that when you have a -- a regulation that contradicts a plain statute, that can be CUE. I think that it would also be natural for the Court to go on to say: And that's what we have here. The question whether that was, for example, outcome-determinative in Mr. George's case could be addressed on remand.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: Are you aware of any Supreme Court case or any case, because I can't think of one, but there must be some -- one somewhere where the legal error at issue was there's a statute and it says you get money or something good if A or B, and then the error that was made was the reg writer left out B? I can't think of a case like that, but there may be one, in which case how the Supreme Court would behave would be quite relevant because usually, you know, there is sort of two sides to the argument. But I don't know of an error that clear that I can think of.</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L. Bostwick: I'm not aware of one, Justice Breyer, that fits that exact scenario, but --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: The other side might be.</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L. Bostwick: But -- but, certainly, you know, it -- it is clear in this Court's cases going back to Manhattan General Equipment, to Dixon, that when the agency's regulation contradicts the statute, that clearly it is a legal nullity.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Counsel, can we go back to your point that this statute is not about adjudicator error, it's about error in the decision, and that's the language of the statute?</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L.

Bostwick: Correct, Your Honor.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: All right. Am I correct that the -- that the veterans -- that the regulations say that there is -- if there is a material new fact that wasn't before the adjudicator, that that could be grounds for a CUE?</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L.

Bostwick: That is a separate type of revision.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Right.</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L. Bostwick: It's a -- it's a -- a separate type of claim. That's not clear and unmistakable error precisely because the Board didn't have those facts before it at the time.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: But that can reopen a decision?</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L. Bostwick: It can reopen a decision. You -- you get prospective benefits --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: So, if a new material fact can reopen a decision, what you're saying is a new, not interpretation of the statute, but a new -- a -- a -- a decision that a statute says what it says is no different than a new material fact, correct?</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L. Bostwick: It's different in -- in the consequences. When you have a new and material fact, you bring a supplemental claim. That's not available when you have what we have here.

Bostwick: Yes.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Let's just posit for the moment that I -- I agree with you the Federal Circuit read CUE too narrowly. It --- unduly influenced by the regulation. And I apologize, but this will -- this -- my time. Count this against my time. And it unduly read it -- it didn't read the statute as it's now written. It read it influenced by the background regulation and -- and to the point where it said even a judicial opinion doesn't qualify in these circumstances. Let's say we agree with you that, yes, that's a clear and unmistakable error. Wagner was one. All right. Fine.</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L.

No, we -- we're not asking the Court to -- to reach that question. It certainly could.

Bostwick: But, no, we think a --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: -- we could say we're not sure if it's a clear and unmistakable error, but we're -- one thing we're sure about is that the Federal Circuit analyzed the question incorrectly.</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L. Bostwick: Certainly. You could say that when you have a -- a regulation that contradicts a plain statute, that can be CUE. I think that it would also be natural for the Court to go on to say: And that's what we have here. The question whether that was, for example, outcome-determinative in Mr. George's case could be addressed on remand.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: Are you aware of any Supreme Court case or any case, because I can't think of one, but there must be some -- one somewhere where the legal error at issue was there's a statute and it says you get money or something good if A or B, and then the error that was made was the reg writer left out B? I can't think of a case like that, but there may be one, in which case how the Supreme Court would behave would be quite relevant because usually, you know, there is sort of two sides to the argument. But I don't know of an error that clear that I can think of.</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L. Bostwick: I'm not aware of one, Justice Breyer, that fits that exact scenario, but --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: The other side might be.</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L. Bostwick: But -- but, certainly, you know, it -- it is clear in this Court's cases going back to Manhattan General Equipment, to Dixon, that when the agency's regulation contradicts the statute, that clearly it is a legal nullity.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Counsel, can we go back to your point that this statute is not about adjudicator error, it's about error in the decision, and that's the language of the statute?</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L. Bostwick: Yes.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: An error in a decision, not who was at fault for it, correct?</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L. Bostwick: Correct, Your Honor.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: All right. Am I correct that the -- that the veterans -- that the regulations say that there is -- if there is a material new fact that wasn't before the adjudicator, that that could be grounds for a CUE?</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L. Bostwick: No, Your Honor.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Ah.</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L. Bostwick: That is a separate type of revision.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Right.</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L. Bostwick: It's a -- it's a -- a separate type of claim. That's not clear and unmistakable error precisely because the Board didn't have those facts before it at the time.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: But that can reopen a decision?</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L. Bostwick: It can reopen a decision. You -- you get prospective benefits --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: So, if a new material fact can reopen a decision, what you're saying is a new, not interpretation of the statute, but a new -- a -- a -- a decision that a statute says what it says is no different than a new material fact, correct?</turn>\n<turn>Melanie L.

Theobald III: Well, I don't think that would factor in, Your Honor, with the qualified immunity analysis. The Seventh Circuit held and the district court held that your decision in Kimel acknowledged equal protection 1983 claims, and that's the issue in qualified immunity. They have not asked this Court to review the qualified immunity aspect of the Seventh Circuit's decision. Just the preclusion part.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A.

I -- I think that the court's -- the district court's decision held no qualified immunity. The Seventh Circuit cited this Court's decision in Kimel. The other cases before this Court, Gregory v.

The Seventh Circuit acknowledged the 1983 age discrimination equal protection claim in 1977 in Gault v. Garrison. This is a well-settled issue.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A.

Certainly, in a Section 922(g)(8) prosecution, an individual could challenge the adequacy of the notice or the hearing. And so, if the argument is I didn't actually receive the notice or I didn't have an opportunity to participate, that would be a defense because Section 922(g)(8) requires that.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.: Now the Petitioners were in on the ground floor with this corporation, but what if they had simply bought into the company the day before the MRT made taxes due? Wouldn't that look an awful lot like a tax on capital rather than a tax on income in any sense of the word?</turn>\n<turn>Elizabeth B. Prelogar: So I have three reactions to that. I think that the underlying nature of what's being taxed, which are the realized earnings of the corporation, wouldn't change. I do think that raises a harder attribution question because that taxpayer would have less of a direct relationship to the thing that's being taxed, and so maybe someone in that situation would have a better as-applied due process claim. As you mentioned, the Moores themselves aren't in that position. The second thing I would say is that if the Court is interested in exploring this as-applied due process issue, it's important to note that the MRT is not unique in this regard. There are other taxes in other contexts where the Court has recognized that someone can be taxed on gain in property that happened before the ownership stake was obtained. That was the holding in Taft versus Bowers, where the Court considered this issue with respect to the gift tax. It's also how Subpart F itself can operate. You can buy shares in the controlled foreign corporation and be taxed under Subpart F with respect to earnings that happened before you bought your stake. The third point I would make is that as a factual matter, this situation is unlikely to arise, and that's because Congress has enacted other provisions of the code that largely tie the gains to the person who owned the shares at the relevant time. This is 26 U.S.C. Section 1248, and it taxes gains at the time of sale. So, in your hypothetical, in -- in 2017, when the person is buying the -- the share in the company, it taxes gains to the seller as though they were paid out of the retained corporate earnings. And then there's a parallel provision for the buyer under the MRT, 26 U.S.C. 965(d)(2)(B), that ensures that the buyer doesn't have to include that in his income through a cross-reference to Section 959.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A.

You know, ultimately, we think that what carries the day here is the overwhelming history that demonstrates that Congress has long taxed income at the corporate level to shareholders. Hubbard upheld that exercise of authority, and so I think, if you're looking at the text of the Sixteenth Amendment and what those who drafted it would have in mind, they would have been well aware of this pass-through taxation and of the Hubbard precedent itself --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A.

It does not. In the Restoration Act, Congress codified the Cabazon Band framework and specifically foreclosed Texas's regulatory authority over the tribe's gaming activities. The plain language of the Act provides us with clear support for this interpretation. On the heels of this Court's decision in Cabazon, Congress changed the language of the Restoration Act to replicate the prohibitory/ regulatory dichotomy struck in Cabazon. Section 107(a) incorporates the Cabazon framework. It federalizes Texas law but only as to prohibited games. And bingo, in the State of Texas, is not a prohibited game. Section 107(b) clearly forecloses any interpretation of Section 107 in its entirety where Texas would have regulatory jurisdiction over tribal gaming. And Section 107(b) must have meaning in the Act. The problem with the State of Texas's interpretation and the Fifth Circuit's interpretation in Ysleta I is that it reads 107(b) out of the Act entirely. This interpretation is also consistent with Congress's extension of the Cabazon framework to IGRA. The two statutes are not in conflict, and you don't have to choose one over the other. And even if that were the case, and we don't think it is, the plain language of the Restoration Act allows my client to engage in non-prohibited gaming activities. In Sections 107(a) and 107(b), Congress was sending the clear signal that it was incorporating the prohibitory/regulatory construct from Cabazon into a test applicable to these tribes. The final text of the Restoration Act reflects the bargain that Congress struck. Each side got something but not everything.

This -- this Court, when it decides admiralty cases, takes a look at the law that exists out -- outside -- out in the real world and -- and tries to figure out, you know, what -- what is a sensible rule of law to apply in this case? And what I'm telling you is -- is the rule of law that the other side is seeking is -- is something that in the choice-of-law area you just don't see anywhere. And I think that's one of the reasons why the two leading choice-of-law law professors, even though they filed an amicus brief at -- at the same time as the other side's amicus brief in support of neither party, came out essentially the same way that we're urging --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Well, they did that -- the Coyle and Roosevelt brief, is that what you're talking about? They did that as a matter of federal common law. So they rejected your premises that -- and they concluded, if -- assuming there's a federal presumption of enforceability and that the exceptions are determined by federal common law, they -- they disagree with you on that. But then I want to ask you about that. Then they adopt -- they say we should adopt the Restatement as the federal exception. And the second one of the Restatement, the second provision, talks about the competing state interests in the -- in the matter. And the other side says don't do that because that Restatement provision was designed for interstate disputes, and this is maritime. To me, if we get to this, this will be really important, what we say about this, so I want to give you a chance to respond to that.</turn>\n<turn>Howard J. Bashman: Right. I -- I think that the reason that the law professors are correct that that Restatement section should be applied here, which, of course, is an argument that we also put forth in our brief --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Yeah, I agree with you, it was a backup backup argument there.</turn>\n<turn>Howard J. Bashman: Right.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: So, yeah.</turn>\n<turn>Howard J. Bashman: Is -- is that this case arises in the setting of -- of a conflict between the law of -- of two states. And that's what I referred to earlier as the horizontal choice-of-law conflict. The other side is trying to turn it into a vertical choice-of-law conflict. But -- but, if there was some federal policy that mattered, we don't dispute that that federal policy would control. That -- that's what Wilburn Boat says. But -- but, again, the other side is trying to pick these cases that arose outside of the maritime insurance context that say that ordinarily we will enforce a choice-of-law provision. Again, a showing of a smattering of federal appellate court decisions that Wilburn -- Wilburn Boat says is not enough to judicially establish it to begin with. And -- and they say let's use that as the main federal rule, and let's apply it to insurance cases too. Again, if -- if Wilburn Boat were so easy to evade, you know, it might make you wonder what -- what's the point of even having it. But, of course, the other side did not make that their issue --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Mr. Bashman, can I just clarify one thing about your answer to Justice Kavanaugh? When -- when you say -- and you said this in your brief too -- that if federal policy cared about it, if federal law cared about it, we would have a rule, are you talking about -- and I won't even try to say the Latin name -- the utmost good faith issue, or are you talking about the choice-of-law issue? Because it kind of sounded to me in your brief and today that you're talking about the utmost good faith issue, which is different.</turn>\n<turn>Howard J.

First of all, that -- that's -- Wilburn Boat weighed the federal interest in uniformity and said that in the maritime insurance area, it did not outweigh state regulation, which is obviously what this case involves, as -- as was alluded to when my friend was up here. Secondly, the type of uniformity that -- that Great Lakes argues in favor of is -- is not the sort of uniformity that this Court ordinarily speaks of in -- in the maritime -- the general maritime law context, where it's essentially a substantive rule. So, as was alluded to earlier, under the Dutra Group case, you can't get punitive damages on an unseaworthiness claim. This -- this case still allows any maritime insurer to pick whatever choice of law to apply -- choice of state law to apply in the absence of federal law.

Nielson:  Sure.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan:  -- usual case, suppose that a state violates Mr. McNamara's First Amendment rights.</turn>\n<turn>Aaron L. Nielson:  Yep.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan:  Could he bring a suit about that?</turn>\n<turn>Aaron L. Nielson:  Yes, Your Honor, for injunctive relief.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan:  Yes. And what Mr. McNamara, I believe, is saying is that -- that the usual distinction that we draw, you can bring a right for injunctive relief, but you can't -- you can bring a suit for injunctive relief, but you can't bring a suit for damages, that's the usual distinction. But it sort of falls apart in this case because the right is a right to be paid.</turn>\n<turn>Aaron L. Nielson:  Yes, Your Honor. And so I  -- I -- I come at this from maybe the other direction. Let's imagine that some government said, you know what, we're not going to pay. We're telling everybody now. Now you are on notice we are not paying. Well, then what happens?  Before they could do anything, you would rush to court and you would say:  Injunction. They can't do it. They've promised they're not going to pay. They're not going to provide that. And the Constitution says, if they don't, they're out -- they're violating their rights. That's Eastern  Enterprises v. Apfel, where if there's -- clear that there's not going to be a right to judicial -- to payment, there are no -- no monies coming, not  -- not judicial, but no payments coming, you can get that injunction right away.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan:  I mean, General, let me make the point another way.</turn>\n<turn>Aaron L. Nielson:  Sure.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan:  I mean, it's sort of backwards to say that Mr. McNamara's client can sue for an injunction, meaning like, you know, give me back my property. Actually, the state has a right to take his property or a prerogative to take  --</turn>\n<turn>Aaron L. Nielson:  Yeah.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan:  -- his property. If the state wants to use his property for a railroad, it doesn't really matter that the -- a person doesn't want to sell. The state has the ability to take -- the only thing that the state does not have the prerogative to do and the thing that the landowner has a right to have is payment.</turn>\n<turn>Aaron L. Nielson:  Yes, Your Honor.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan:  So to say, well, look, you can sue for an injunction but you can't sue for payment just doesn't understand the nature of this right.</turn>\n<turn>Aaron L. Nielson:  Well, so our first- line argument is, you know, the way the United States did it for a hundred years is correct. But, if the Court disagrees with that, if the Court says, you know what, actually --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan:  So, General, I kind of agree with that. Your best argument is like what happened between the time of the Constitution and, you know, someplace in the late 19th Century. But suppose that I'm not such an originalist and I don't really care about that. (Laughter.)</turn>\n<turn>Aaron L. Nielson:  Sure. All right. So that's the answer I'm going to say. So, if we -- if a court says, we read First English and it requires not just a substantive relief, it requires some sort of judicial proceeding, which  we don't think is consistent with the history, but let's assume, Texas does it. Texas provides  a cause of action for which they can bring a federal takings claim. So even if that is true, which we don't believe as our first -line argument is correct, Texas still wins. They --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  What if Texas didn't do it, though?</turn>\n<turn>Aaron L. Nielson:  So  -- so that's where we get interesting.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  But I'm not -- and I just want to be clear I'm not talking about the hypothetical you gave where Texas announces in advance  --</turn>\n<turn>Aaron L. Nielson:  Yeah.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  -- we're going to take and we're not going to pay. Let's say that Texas takes and just this one property owner can't get the money, the  --Texas is being intransigent about it.</turn>\n<turn>Aaron L.

So, you know, if a state goes rogue, that's how we're thinking about it, because we know from Knick all the states don't do that, but let's assume some state says, we're just not going to do that. Well, you have injunctive relief. I realize that might not be a perfect relief --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Doesn't work in this hypothetical.</turn>\n<turn>Aaron L.

It also applies to after-the-fact payments. And if I can just say one other thing because  you say on reward about \"corrupt,\" a thousand dollar bottle of wine.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  No, but that's a gratuity.</turn>\n<turn>Lisa S.

That's the plain language. And I think, in your view, you'd have to draw a line between the two-buck chuck at Trader Joe's and the wine that goes up to 500,000. And I don't know where the government's line is. There is no drop -down menu on Amazon for mens rea. People  -- there's just not  -- there is no gratuity  -- there are 13 gratuity statutes. None of them are like this. They have no mens rea because they're just prophylactic bright-line rules. You can't get that compensation, which is why that is the federal rule. You get even a dollar, it is a crime regardless of mens rea. And there are 11,000 pages of guidance to make sure that when you're a federal employee you don't go to jail for two years. I don't know what every single person  --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  So what is \"rewarded\" doing in this statute?  Because, basically, you've defined it as bribery. And we have \"intending to in\" -- \"to be influenced.\" So what is the work of \"rewarded\"?</turn>\n<turn>Lisa S. Blatt:  Two critical things.

Alito, Jr.:  --  is the question whether it would be wrong for Congress to criminalize that or whether, in fact, Congress has criminalized it?</turn>\n<turn>Lisa S. Blatt:  Yes. It's the latter.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  It's the latter. So, okay.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  And why doesn't the language cover  -- I mean, I understand you -- we've --  we're all thinking about this in terms of gratuities, and that opens the door to all of the, you know, relatively benign examples that you bring up, you know, when someone's just sort of showing thanks for doing services. But the statute does not use the word \"gratuities.\"  In fact, the statute uses terminology that's very similar to what Justice Sotomayor just said, right?  \"Someone who corruptly solicits or demands\" -- and I'm skipping here --  \"anything of value intending to be rewarded.\"</turn>\n<turn>Lisa S. Blatt:  And the  --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  And that  -- and those are the facts that the government is at least alleging in this case.</turn>\n<turn>Lisa S. Blatt:  And \"corruptly\" is  -- is completely a foreign concept to \"gratuity,\" and it's very familiar  --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  No, but I'm not  --</turn>\n<turn>Lisa S. Blatt:  --  to bribery.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  Set aside \"gratuity.\"  I'm just looking at the statute. Why is  -- aren't the facts that the government alleges here fitting entirely with the statement, the text of this statute?</turn>\n<turn>Lisa S. Blatt:  Because the plain language of \"reward\" can mean bribes. And it has  -- it has been used that --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  And it can't mean after the fact seeking a payment for something that you've done officially?</turn>\n<turn>Lisa S. Blatt:  \"Rewarding\" can  plainly mean bribes to officials who aren't actually influenced. You give me money and either you're never going to take the vote or you couldn't take it anyway. It also applies to after-the-fact payments. And if I can just say one other thing because  you say on reward about \"corrupt,\" a thousand dollar bottle of wine.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  No, but that's a gratuity.</turn>\n<turn>Lisa S. Blatt:  A $2,000 bottle of wine.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  But  -- but I guess, if the person is demanding it as a result of something that they've done  --</turn>\n<turn>Lisa S. Blatt:  It applies to givers --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  --  it would be the same scenario.</turn>\n<turn>Lisa S. Blatt:  --  equally. It's the same statute that applies to the givers. So you and anyone else in this room who gives an expensive bottle of wine to a nurse in connection with  --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  Is she demanding it?</turn>\n<turn>Lisa S. Blatt:  --  a $5,000 surgery --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  Is she demanding it for having done something in  -- to me or my family?</turn>\n<turn>Lisa S. Blatt:  You have to divorce 601 -- the giver to the taker. I mean, yeah, the giver to the taker. It's the exact same wording. It applies to anyone who gives with an  intent to reward. That's the plain language. And I think, in your view, you'd have to draw a line between the two-buck chuck at Trader Joe's and the wine that goes up to 500,000. And I don't know where the government's line is. There is no drop -down menu on Amazon for mens rea. People  -- there's just not  -- there is no gratuity  -- there are 13 gratuity statutes. None of them are like this. They have no mens rea because they're just prophylactic bright-line rules. You can't get that compensation, which is why that is the federal rule. You get even a dollar, it is a crime regardless of mens rea. And there are 11,000 pages of guidance to make sure that when you're a federal employee you don't go to jail for two years. I don't know what every single person  --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  So what is \"rewarded\" doing in this statute?  Because, basically, you've defined it as bribery. And we have \"intending to in\" -- \"to be influenced.\" So what is the work of \"rewarded\"?</turn>\n<turn>Lisa S. Blatt:  Two critical things. And the government has a response  -- it's not a good one  -- on one of them. They have no response to my first point. It takes the issue of timing and causation off the table, and where they don't have a response is on causation.

Jones: I disagree with that.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: But why is that? Because that's what I was saying at the beginning, that it seems clear to me that under the terms of the Hobbs Act, the Hobbs Act does prohibit robberies that affect commerce. Raich says commerce includes both interstate and intrastate marijuana trafficking. So the Hobbs Act prohibits robberies that affect marijuana trafficking generally, whether it's interstate or intrastate. What's there to disagree with in that?</turn>\n<turn>Dennis E.

Commerce is either interstate marijuana trafficking or intrastate marijuana trafficking under the definition in this statute. So you -- the government has to show that a robbery affected some kind of marijuana trafficking. It doesn't matter what kind. Wouldn't you agree with that? I mean, it just seems --</turn>\n<turn>Dennis E. Jones: Yeah. I -- I --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: -- it's the current of the statute plus Raich.</turn>\n<turn>Dennis E. Jones: Right.

The problem seems to be that you're resisting the notion that the business could be entirely intrastate.

And I guess actually this gets out to this idea that our reading of \"remaining\" makes that prong more important than the \"entry\" prong. And -- and I think really our response is that it doesn't matter, right, that if you look at the law of trespass, it has the same pairing of \"to enter\" or \"remain.\" And I don't think anybody cares which -- whether one of those is more important than the other or whether many entry trespasses bleed into remaining trespasses.

But -- but, beyond that, I'm not sure I know.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Can I --</turn>\n<turn>Zachary D. Tripp: If I can --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: -- ask the same question that I asked the other side, which is in the universe of burglaries, do you have a sense of how many are remaining in?</turn>\n<turn>Zachary D. Tripp: I -- my sense is that it's pretty rare, that -- that it's pretty few, that in the, like, overwhelming number of burglary cases, you're going to have evidence of an unlawful entry and then that's just how you prove it up and that becomes the whole case. And I guess actually this gets out to this idea that our reading of \"remaining\" makes that prong more important than the \"entry\" prong. And -- and I think really our response is that it doesn't matter, right, that if you look at the law of trespass, it has the same pairing of \"to enter\" or \"remain.\" And I don't think anybody cares which -- whether one of those is more important than the other or whether many entry trespasses bleed into remaining trespasses. They -- they're covering the waterfront of a trespass, and I think it's the same here.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: And if you were to lose this case, potentially all burglaries from how many states would no longer be able to be counted as --</turn>\n<turn>Zachary D. Tripp: Yeah, it -- it would be 18 states and counting. So there's 18 states with a population of 130 million today. There's another 11 that have still -- haven't addressed this issue. And assuming that the current trends continue, probably more of them will read \"remain\" to mean \"remains.\"</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: May I ask you the --</turn>\n<turn>Zachary D. Tripp: And then --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: -- same question I asked Mr. Marwell, which -- how many of those states have other burglary statutes that you could capture, can I say real burglary in?</turn>\n<turn>Zachary D. Tripp: I prefer not the real burglary, but, yeah. I think there is -- there is -- there is a mix. I think ten of these states have adopted this rule by statute, but I don't know how much the different ones are -- are used relative to each other. But you would still be tossing out an enormous number of burglary prosecutions, you know, including from -- from Michigan, Texas, some very big states. And then I think another critical point, again, is that -- is that Petitioner's given you no logical stopping point, right, that this is -- it -- it cannot end here. If you think that it gets at this level of specificity, then why not all the other disputes about, you know, what it constitutes to be unprivileged, what exactly an entry is, and on and on and on. And I think what it really gets to is that --</turn>\n</context>\n<justice>Justice Neil Gorsuch</justice>\nGenerate a question that Justice Neil Gorsuch is likely to ask next.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch: Well, counsel, I -- I'd like to just explore that just a little bit further, because I think you're right.

Filarsky cited treatises treating special deputy sheriffs -- those are sheriffs appointed to undertake the sheriff's duty for a particular task -- as officers within the meaning of resisting of officer statutes. Filarsky relied on that history in determining why the contractors in that case should be entitled to a qualified immunity. So I think that's the prototypical example. And we're not -- we're not arguing based on the contract. So the second point would be, if we were -- if all we had was the contract, we wouldn't be here today. For instance, we have collections associations -- they're called third-party vendors -- that we only contract with. There is no statute. We do not assert that they are officers or employees covered by this exemption. They just contract with us to help us with our collection activities. But special counsel are different. There is a statute, R.C. 109.08, that clearly indicates that just as, historically, sheriffs delegated to special deputies, the attorney general can delegate his sovereign duties to --</turn>\n</context>\n<justice>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</justice>\nGenerate a question that Justice Sonia Sotomayor is likely to ask next.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor: So why don't you just call them employees?

I don't think so.</turn>\n<turn>Bryan Stevenson: --No. Our argument simply is that the question that the trial judge dealt with here was, in part, dependent on an assessment of the Federal Constitution, whether the Eighth Amendment does constrain a sentence like this. We relied on Roper. The court found that Roper was not available to Mr. Sullivan when his case was on appeal, prior to 1993. Based on that determination, the court then engaged in an analysis. And, again, what triggered this -- and I just want to make this really clear, that death row prisoners after Roper in Florida got a better sentence than Joe Sullivan. They got life with parole eligibility after 25 years. The argument was that that established a reasonable basis for Joe Sullivan--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: I thought -- I thought Simmons got life without parole. I thought that Simmons's sentence was life without parole.</turn>\n<turn>Bryan Stevenson: --Simmons did, Your Honor, in Missouri. But in Florida, at the point at which these sentences were being imposed, there was no life without parole for capital murder. People convicted of capital murder could -- could only be sentenced to life in prison, with parole eligibility after 25 years. And so the question was generated by this Court's decision in Roper, how is it constitutional under the Eighth Amendment for the death sentence prisoner to get life with parole after 25 years, and Joe Sullivan at 13, convicted of a non-homicide--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Your argument is that because the -- the State judge had to decide whether Roper dictated or required the result that you were asking for, that -- that it's not an independent State ground. That's the argument?</turn>\n<turn>Bryan Stevenson: --My argument is that if Roper applied -- if Roper is relevant -- because what the State courts of Florida have said is that when you are looking at this question there are three things. One, is it a rule from the Florida Supreme Court or United States Supreme Court? Two, is it a rule of constitutional -- of a constitutional nature? Which, obviously, this would be.

And what triggered this -- and this is why this is relevant to this procedural question -- was that the State of Florida did apply Roper to juveniles who had been sentenced to death after this Court's decision. And the case we cited to the Florida appeals court, Bonifay v. Florida -- it's on page 38 of our joint appendix -- was a case where Florida implemented that law, and the law under Florida was that death row prisoners sentenced at the time of Joe Sullivan--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Let me -- let me--</turn>\n<turn>Bryan Stevenson: --had their sentences reduced to life in prison with parole.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: --But this judge said: Yes, there's a Federal question in this case: Does Roper render unconstitutional life without parole for juveniles? He answered that question: no. And then he said: There is no other Federal question in the case; I do not reach the question that you are raising, that is, life without parole being cruel and unusual. All -- the only Federal question that, under our rules, I reach is, does Roper cover this case? No. Anything else is procedurally barred. What was wrong with that?</turn>\n<turn>Bryan Stevenson: Well, because under your precedent, if the question -- if the judgment of procedural default is dependent on an analysis, an assessment of Federal law, in any context, then it is not an independent and adequate State ground, and that's the basis on which we--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: Well, suppose arguendo we assume that the judge is right, that Roper did not establish a rule that applies in this case. Then what position are you in with reference to the procedural bar? Do you have any other arguments that overcome the procedural bar?</turn>\n<turn>Bryan Stevenson: --Yes, that is the rule would still allow us to challenge the sentence under the notime restriction as it relates to the sentence--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: No, no. The only Federal question in the case now -- or at least the preliminary Federal question, the threshold Federal question, is simply whether the State court was right about what Roper did. And if we agree with the State court about what Roper did, then the State's bar automatically applies and that's the end of the case.</turn>\n<turn>Bryan Stevenson: --Well, yes, but if you agree with the State court about Roper did, then we don't -- we are not entitled to relief under -- under either theory, under a merits theory or a default theory, but the point is--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Oh, I don't -- I don't know about that.

Are you -- are you diminishing that as a compelling state interest?</turn>\n<turn>Hashim M. Mooppan: No, Your Honor.

You might meet every criteria the state sets forth. But they're imposing an additional criteria.</turn>\n<turn>Hashim M. Mooppan: So two points about that, Your Honor.

It's that some agencies live in a particular community, and so more people will come to it from that community.</turn>\n<turn>Hashim M.

But, on the flip side, I think it's important to emphasize that the City's rules do consider disability when certifying foster parents.

And their harmless-error analysis was insufficient, I think, for three reasons. Okay? I believe that it was -- it fails the Brecht-Kotteakos test because they simply took a look at the remaining evidence and they did not make any effort, as the Seventh Circuit did, to assess precisely what impact this knowledge/motive finding had on the judge.

He suggested or said that you haven't identified a circumstance in which something that EMTALA requires Idaho wouldn't allow. And I  -- I didn't get a chance to ask him, but I took  --I took him to sort of mean that the way that Idaho's statute operates, it basically allows for a doctor to say, well, in my view, you know, this health-threatening circumstance could eventually lead to death, and so I'm going to do it. So, to the extent that doctors are still able to do that, I guess, he's saying there's no preemption. But is it true that there really isn't in operation a difference between the two  -- the EMTALA and what Idaho has required here?</turn>\n<turn>Elizabeth B. Prelogar:  No. That is gravely mistaken on three levels. It's  inconsistent with the actual text of the Idaho law. It's inconsistent with medical reality. And it's inconsistent with what's happening on the ground. And this is a really important point, so let me try to unpack this. On the text  itself, Idaho's law only allows termination if it's necessary to prevent death. And that is textually very narrow compared to what EMTALA requires with the category of harm to begin with. In Idaho, doctors have to shut their eyes to everything except death, whereas, under EMTALA, you're supposed to be thinking about things like, is she about to lose her fertility? Is her uterus going to become incredibly scarred because of the bleeding?  Is she about to undergo the possibility of kidney failure?  So I think that that is one critical distinction. The other critical textual distinction is the idea of necessity. Under Idaho law, you have to conclude that death will necessarily result, which is also materially different, and the Idaho Supreme Court specifically recognized it. Second, with respect to the actual medical reality here, there are numerous  conditions that we are worried about where a doctor's immediate concern is not death. That's a far more remote possibility. They're thinking about the health circumstances that EMTALA guards against. And let me give you two examples. The first is PPROM, premature rupture of the  membranes. We have declarations at 594 that explain this in detail and also at JA 615 to 617. What the doctors explained there -- this is Dr. Fleischer and Dr. Cooper  --is a woman comes in with PPROM, her sac is ruptured. There's no chance the fetus is going to be able to survive, but at that point, she doesn't have active signs of infection, and so, until she deteriorates, you can't think she's close to death. What you're worried about is she will become infected. She might develop sepsis. She might have these dramatic consequences for her future, but it's not about death. So I think that is one example where you can't do it. And then, finally, just the actual practice on the ground, women in Idaho today are not getting treatment. They are getting  airlifted out of the state to Salt Lake City and to neighboring states where there are health exceptions and there are laws because the doctors are facing mandatory minimum two years in prison, loss of their license, criminal prosecution. The doctors can't provide the care because until they can conclude that a prosecutor looking over their shoulder won't second -guess that maybe it wasn't really necessary to prevent death.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

Dreeben: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As Justice Breyer indicated, there really are three stark choices before the Court in this case. Paroline's position is that, because of a proximate causation requirement, Amy can obtain nothing in restitution. Amy's position is that because multiple people have contributed to her single loss, she can obtain the full restitution for all of her losses from every criminal defendant. The government's position is that there is a solution that tort law has developed for providing some restitution for Amy, not the entire restitution that would be owed on account of her entire loss.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Yes. Well, now -- not because tort law has developed that. I mean, I frankly don't agree with what you say modern tort law is supposed to allow, and -- and Keeton, you know, doesn't really establish that that's what the courts now do. But even without agreeing with that, can't I find that that is the system that this statute intended to impose? I mean, we're dealing here with a question of statutory interpretation. So the question is not what does modern tort law allow, but the question is what reasonably could Congress have meant by this statute.</turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: I agree with that, Justice Scalia.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Because I'm not going to go along with you on, you know, modern tort. I think that's nonsense. I don't think it's true.</turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: Okay. The -- the tort law issue is not really all that modern. It dates back to the Restatement, Second, of Torts in Section 443(a). And this Court applied that section in the Burlington Northern case, which was a CERCLA case, to hold that apportionment of the damages was required in a pollution case where all the pollution had merged into a single--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: But how do you square your position with the statutory language? The statutory language requires mandatory restitution order for the, quote, \"full amount of the victim's losses. \" It also forbids courts to -- to decline to issue an order, double negative, but it can't -- a court can't refuse to issue an order on the ground that the victim has been compensated by any other source. It seems to me that that language, as crazy as it seems to you or -- to you, compels joint and several liability, because it's saying any -- all losses, full amount of losses, and you can't offset her compensation from any other sources.</turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: --Justice Sotomayor, I think that the key to reading the statutory language is that the definition of \"victim\" refers to a victim of the offense in this case. So the term \"victim\" means the individual harmed as a result of a commission of a crime under this chapter. The government's burden of proof in Section 3664(e) refers to demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a victim as a result of the offense. So it refers to the defendant's offense, not to the collective harm that the--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: So why isn't that a but-for cause? I mean, if you're going to argue that, you have to be arguing but-for--</turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: --I don't think so.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: --that their damages have to be the but-for cause.</turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: I hope that the Court will read the \"as a result of\" language to require causation, but to interpret it in light of the way causation has been understood in the unique circumstances that you have here.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: You don't deny but-for. I haven't understood your submission to be that there need not be but-for cause here.</turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: There's collective, aggregate but-for cause. And the way that tort law dealt with this is not to accept Paroline's position that, even if it -- you took me out of the equation, Amy's harm would be very severe. Unquestionably true. What tort law said is that if a multiplicity of actors inflict a single harm and one of them comes forward with a reason that, if accepted, would exonerate all of them, then that cannot be a proper test of causation.

Dreeben: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As Justice Breyer indicated, there really are three stark choices before the Court in this case. Paroline's position is that, because of a proximate causation requirement, Amy can obtain nothing in restitution. Amy's position is that because multiple people have contributed to her single loss, she can obtain the full restitution for all of her losses from every criminal defendant. The government's position is that there is a solution that tort law has developed for providing some restitution for Amy, not the entire restitution that would be owed on account of her entire loss.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Yes. Well, now -- not because tort law has developed that. I mean, I frankly don't agree with what you say modern tort law is supposed to allow, and -- and Keeton, you know, doesn't really establish that that's what the courts now do. But even without agreeing with that, can't I find that that is the system that this statute intended to impose? I mean, we're dealing here with a question of statutory interpretation. So the question is not what does modern tort law allow, but the question is what reasonably could Congress have meant by this statute.</turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: I agree with that, Justice Scalia.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Because I'm not going to go along with you on, you know, modern tort. I think that's nonsense. I don't think it's true.</turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: Okay. The -- the tort law issue is not really all that modern. It dates back to the Restatement, Second, of Torts in Section 443(a). And this Court applied that section in the Burlington Northern case, which was a CERCLA case, to hold that apportionment of the damages was required in a pollution case where all the pollution had merged into a single--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: But how do you square your position with the statutory language? The statutory language requires mandatory restitution order for the, quote, \"full amount of the victim's losses. \" It also forbids courts to -- to decline to issue an order, double negative, but it can't -- a court can't refuse to issue an order on the ground that the victim has been compensated by any other source. It seems to me that that language, as crazy as it seems to you or -- to you, compels joint and several liability, because it's saying any -- all losses, full amount of losses, and you can't offset her compensation from any other sources.</turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: --Justice Sotomayor, I think that the key to reading the statutory language is that the definition of \"victim\" refers to a victim of the offense in this case. So the term \"victim\" means the individual harmed as a result of a commission of a crime under this chapter. The government's burden of proof in Section 3664(e) refers to demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a victim as a result of the offense. So it refers to the defendant's offense, not to the collective harm that the--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: So why isn't that a but-for cause? I mean, if you're going to argue that, you have to be arguing but-for--</turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: --I don't think so.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: --that their damages have to be the but-for cause.</turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: I hope that the Court will read the \"as a result of\" language to require causation, but to interpret it in light of the way causation has been understood in the unique circumstances that you have here.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: You don't deny but-for. I haven't understood your submission to be that there need not be but-for cause here.</turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: There's collective, aggregate but-for cause. And the way that tort law dealt with this is not to accept Paroline's position that, even if it -- you took me out of the equation, Amy's harm would be very severe. Unquestionably true. What tort law said is that if a multiplicity of actors inflict a single harm and one of them comes forward with a reason that, if accepted, would exonerate all of them, then that cannot be a proper test of causation. The proper test is aggregate causation where the aggregate group of offenders is the but-for cause and each one of the individuals in that set can be regarded as--</turn>\n</context>\n<justice>Justice John G.

Roberts, Jr.: Justice -- Justice Gorsuch?</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: That's super helpful because, as I read it, and I may be the only one, though I don't think so, the only QP was on the first question, whether Nollan/Dolan applies to legislative enactments. There -- there was a circuit split. That's -- that's why we took the case. And we could answer that and be done. Now, if we went on, we have to decide whether it's a tax for the first one, and on the second one, we have to decide whether there's a difference between legislative enactments in gross and specific actions. On that, I guess, I had a question. Couldn't one recharacterize what happened in Dolan as legislation in gross? There was a county code that said if thou wants to develop on a beach, thou will give 15-foot easements, and all they did was pretty much ministerially apply the legislative code. So how are we supposed to draw a distinction if we're going to get -- if we're going to go down that road and try and decide that question, which I don't think is before us, but if we were to, how do we distinguish between Dolan and your case?</turn>\n<turn>Aileen M. McGrath: So I think there are two bases of distinction. I think one relates to what Dolan itself decided. And, there, I think that Dolan itself involved legislation that looks very different from the legislation here in two respects. And, here, I would point the Court to page 380 of the Dolan decision, which emphasized two features of that ordinance. One was that it allowed for variances, significant variances from any sort of baseline mitigation floor that the legislation imposes, and, number two, it gave permitting officials discretion to identify the amount of open space that was required under that scheme when they --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Yeah, but they didn't -- they didn't do either of those things. They just pretty much followed the rule, 15-foot easement, boom, you've to give us a 15-foot easement as I understood it.</turn>\n<turn>Aileen M. McGrath: I think that's also, of course, putting to the side the fact that that case involved an easement and therefore didn't -- didn't raise these questions.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: I understand that. But that's all that -- that's the first can of worms, which we're not getting -- I mean, we could say that this is a tax and that's a different -- but this is the second can of worms that -- that we're talking about now, which is legislation versus specific, and I guess I'm not sure where we draw that line.</turn>\n<turn>Aileen M. McGrath: I think, there, the line that we draw, which gets to the second part of my answer to the first question, is on the non-discretionary and mandatory nature of the fees that were charged here. Here, the fees are set by a predetermined schedule. That is exactly what the Petitioner is challenging.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: So, if there were a predetermined schedule, but a potential for variance existed, but they didn't vary, it would then be on the Dolan side of the line rather than your side of the line?</turn>\n<turn>Aileen M. McGrath: I think, if it were a -- I think it's on -- the condition in Dolan is on the Dolan side of the line primarily because there's a taking. But, here, I think that in a case where there's significant discretion involved or variances allowed, I think that would be a harder case and a different one. And, here, we're emphasizing the non-discretionary and mandatory nature, which we think, again, you know, relates primarily to the similarity to that.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Thank you. Thank you.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Kavanaugh?</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: One question. On the \"is it a taking\" question that Justice Kagan raised and there's disagreement on that, and you say there's not a taking and you had answered Justice Jackson the same way, I think, though, then your due process review does, I think -- I just want to get back to this -- apply concepts like rough proportionality and essential nexus so long as that review is not applied at the parcel-specific level. Is that correct?</turn>\n<turn>Aileen M.

In your exchange with Justice Gorsuch, who very clearly isolated the question presented, as I read it, the question presented at least as the Petitioner put it forward is whether a permit exaction is exempt from the unconstitutional conditions doctrine simply because it's authorized by legislation. So it seems to me that there is a threshold assumption that the permit exaction would otherwise trigger the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, and the question is, is it exempt from that just because of legislation. So, because there is disagreement about whether it would trigger it to begin with, I would think that to isolate the question presented as -- at a minimum, we would have to expressly preserve the assumption, right? I mean, our -- our holding or our opinion would have to say assuming that a permit exaction of the nature of this one triggers the unconstitutional, that we couldn't not say that, right, in order to just isolate the question presented?", "transcript_id": "2023.22-1074-t01", "justice": "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson", "full_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nYou are a Supreme Court Justice participating in oral arguments.

McGrath: I think that is correct, Justice Kagan.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Okay. I just wanted to make that clear.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice -- Justice Gorsuch?</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: That's super helpful because, as I read it, and I may be the only one, though I don't think so, the only QP was on the first question, whether Nollan/Dolan applies to legislative enactments. There -- there was a circuit split. That's -- that's why we took the case. And we could answer that and be done. Now, if we went on, we have to decide whether it's a tax for the first one, and on the second one, we have to decide whether there's a difference between legislative enactments in gross and specific actions. On that, I guess, I had a question. Couldn't one recharacterize what happened in Dolan as legislation in gross? There was a county code that said if thou wants to develop on a beach, thou will give 15-foot easements, and all they did was pretty much ministerially apply the legislative code. So how are we supposed to draw a distinction if we're going to get -- if we're going to go down that road and try and decide that question, which I don't think is before us, but if we were to, how do we distinguish between Dolan and your case?</turn>\n<turn>Aileen M. McGrath: So I think there are two bases of distinction. I think one relates to what Dolan itself decided. And, there, I think that Dolan itself involved legislation that looks very different from the legislation here in two respects. And, here, I would point the Court to page 380 of the Dolan decision, which emphasized two features of that ordinance. One was that it allowed for variances, significant variances from any sort of baseline mitigation floor that the legislation imposes, and, number two, it gave permitting officials discretion to identify the amount of open space that was required under that scheme when they --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Yeah, but they didn't -- they didn't do either of those things. They just pretty much followed the rule, 15-foot easement, boom, you've to give us a 15-foot easement as I understood it.</turn>\n<turn>Aileen M. McGrath: I think that's also, of course, putting to the side the fact that that case involved an easement and therefore didn't -- didn't raise these questions.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: I understand that. But that's all that -- that's the first can of worms, which we're not getting -- I mean, we could say that this is a tax and that's a different -- but this is the second can of worms that -- that we're talking about now, which is legislation versus specific, and I guess I'm not sure where we draw that line.</turn>\n<turn>Aileen M. McGrath: I think, there, the line that we draw, which gets to the second part of my answer to the first question, is on the non-discretionary and mandatory nature of the fees that were charged here. Here, the fees are set by a predetermined schedule. That is exactly what the Petitioner is challenging.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: So, if there were a predetermined schedule, but a potential for variance existed, but they didn't vary, it would then be on the Dolan side of the line rather than your side of the line?</turn>\n<turn>Aileen M. McGrath: I think, if it were a -- I think it's on -- the condition in Dolan is on the Dolan side of the line primarily because there's a taking. But, here, I think that in a case where there's significant discretion involved or variances allowed, I think that would be a harder case and a different one. And, here, we're emphasizing the non-discretionary and mandatory nature, which we think, again, you know, relates primarily to the similarity to that.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Thank you. Thank you.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Kavanaugh?</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: One question. On the \"is it a taking\" question that Justice Kagan raised and there's disagreement on that, and you say there's not a taking and you had answered Justice Jackson the same way, I think, though, then your due process review does, I think -- I just want to get back to this -- apply concepts like rough proportionality and essential nexus so long as that review is not applied at the parcel-specific level. Is that correct?</turn>\n<turn>Aileen M. McGrath: I think we would use words like reasonableness or rationality rather than rough proportionality, but I think, Justice Kavanaugh, at the end of the day, I take your question to be suggesting there's not a significant difference in your mind between those two scenarios, in which case that -- that is, I think, part of -- that is part of our -- our position, is that if any sort of heightened review is necessary here, it needs to be performed at a programmatic basis that looks at the categories that the legislature itself has drawn.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M.

So you say that you're not challenging the Nollan/Dolan framework. You're just saying it doesn't apply to legislative enactments. And I think that the Petitioner is saying that the Nollan/Dolan framework does apply, but we're not going to apply it in this case because this is a tax. So you're not saying that Nollan/Dolan is wrong. You're just saying that it doesn't apply. Am I right?<|eot_id|>"}

Vale: Well, I think there is a very different tradition and understanding for compacts, and that's because, if you look at -- if you -- the pre-50 -- the pre-1953 compacts, as I said at the beginning, 80 of those -- and these are listed in the Appendix A in the blue brief. There were 80, and 56 omitted a termination clause. And yet, New Jersey admits that many of them, I think about 36, do not allow termination. And that 36, they do a couple different things. There are boundary compacts, which I think we all agree don't allow unilateral termination, but there's also shared jurisdiction provisions in some of those boundary compacts, and also there are some compacts that have shared jurisdiction without setting the boundary. And New York and New Jersey had one of those about this same harbor -- this is the 1834 boundary compact between New York and New Jersey -- that both set the boundary and created a shared jurisdiction swap where sometimes New York has jurisdiction over the water up to the New Jersey line, sometimes New Jersey has service of process jurisdiction up to the New York line, and that compact is understood not to allow unilateral withdrawal even though it omitted a clause.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M.

It's a very dangerous thing. If you're going to do it, you have to allow us to, you know, check blood-alcohol levels if you're in an accident. You have to agree to that. I mean, that's the whole point. It's to avoid all these -- these issues at a time when exigency is certainly a common aspect, given dissipation of alcohol in -- in -- in blood. So, again, I guess what's -- maybe I'll go back. Did I understand your answer about actual consent? In other words, you go down to the DMV. When they take your -- you know, your driver's test, they say here's a form; we need you to sign this. And the form is, I consent to have my blood drawn. That's actual consent. Is there anything wrong with that?</turn>\n<turn>Andrew R.

Roberts, Jr.: Well, no, but I do have to have a reason you don't think it's okay.</turn>\n<turn>Andrew R. Hinkel: Because, again, when the state conditions, you know, participation in some activity on your consent to give up some part of your Fourth Amendment --</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

Akamai had pursued their case as a direct infringement case under 271(a). The Federal Circuit granted that en banc petition.

That's what you're asking us to say, that the original understanding was that there would be no double jeopardy bar between different sovereigns when those sovereigns are foreign countries. So how could we avoid that consequence?</turn>\n<turn>Louis A. Chaiten: Well, first of all, I'm not sure the case is ever going to arise, but -- and this is State of Alabama and federal government and its undisputed concurrent jurisdiction. The rule is a rule of concurrent jurisdiction. So it's when is the U.S. going to recognize the current -- concurrent jurisdiction of another country. And, again, I want -- just wanted to say that Murphy v. Waterfront Commission is a case where the court held that the self-incrimination privilege applies cross-jurisdictionally.

And I would like to emphasize that it is -- it would be -- no one in any of these briefs has pointed to a pattern of intersovereign successive prosecutions between nations that is going to be disrupted by our rule, even if the Court were to suggest that it's -- it would also apply between foreign nations.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Well, can I ask you a different --</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: We've been through -- we've been through all this in Bartkus, right?</turn>\n<turn>Louis A. Chaiten: I don't think the Court has been -- ever given this question a full and fair opportunity, certainly post-incorporation, and it's important to understand how the holding of this Court arose. There was, of course, a suggestion in Fox v. Ohio in 1847 that there might be a separate sovereigns exception. It was based on a non-incorporation rationale, but no one actually -- it's dicta. It's the purest dicta, because there were no intersovereign successive prosecutions, not only not in that case but no practice of them. The first time this Court had a chance to actually hold whether that's permissible was Lanza. And I think it's worth reading the respondent's brief in -- in Lanza, Lanza's brief. There was no representation, the position we're presenting here. The brief was incoherent, and the Court said I think what counsel is arguing is that the separate sovereigns exception doesn't apply in the particular context of the Eighteenth Amendment, given the concurrent powers of the states and the federal government.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: None of these concerns were presented in Bartkus, though, right?</turn>\n<turn>Louis A. Chaiten: Excuse me?</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: None of the concerns you've been talking about there were presented in Bartkus?</turn>\n<turn>Louis A. Chaiten: So -- so just -- Bartkus was decided at the same time as Abbate. Abbate is the case that answers this particular question. Abbate remarkably says we're just going to adhere to Lanza because none of the issues that are presented today are different from what was presented in Lanza, which is a really remarkable statement. And Abbate is also pre-incorporation. Bartkus obviously is a due process case under the burden of Palko v.

The Court subsequently limited that to parties bound by the Double Jeopardy Clause. So there is a principled way of doing this if the Court ever gets such a case and wants to do that. And I would like to emphasize that it is -- it would be -- no one in any of these briefs has pointed to a pattern of intersovereign successive prosecutions between nations that is going to be disrupted by our rule, even if the Court were to suggest that it's -- it would also apply between foreign nations.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Well, can I ask you a different --</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: We've been through -- we've been through all this in Bartkus, right?</turn>\n<turn>Louis A. Chaiten: I don't think the Court has been -- ever given this question a full and fair opportunity, certainly post-incorporation, and it's important to understand how the holding of this Court arose. There was, of course, a suggestion in Fox v. Ohio in 1847 that there might be a separate sovereigns exception. It was based on a non-incorporation rationale, but no one actually -- it's dicta. It's the purest dicta, because there were no intersovereign successive prosecutions, not only not in that case but no practice of them. The first time this Court had a chance to actually hold whether that's permissible was Lanza. And I think it's worth reading the respondent's brief in -- in Lanza, Lanza's brief. There was no representation, the position we're presenting here. The brief was incoherent, and the Court said I think what counsel is arguing is that the separate sovereigns exception doesn't apply in the particular context of the Eighteenth Amendment, given the concurrent powers of the states and the federal government.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: None of these concerns were presented in Bartkus, though, right?</turn>\n<turn>Louis A. Chaiten: Excuse me?</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: None of the concerns you've been talking about there were presented in Bartkus?</turn>\n<turn>Louis A. Chaiten: So -- so just -- Bartkus was decided at the same time as Abbate. Abbate is the case that answers this particular question. Abbate remarkably says we're just going to adhere to Lanza because none of the issues that are presented today are different from what was presented in Lanza, which is a really remarkable statement. And Abbate is also pre-incorporation. Bartkus obviously is a due process case under the burden of Palko v. Connecticut, and the -- the evidence that we're presenting here was not fully presented in Bartkus.

Putting aside what the Sixth Circuit did here, if you look back at the initial State Court opinion, do you read the State court -- do you think the State court is fairly read, could the Sixth Circuit have fairly read it, as establishing its own per se rule, which was the per se rule that we rejected in Mathis? In other words, that the State supreme court required some kind of nexus between the prison custody and the interrogation?</turn>\n<turn>Ginger D.  Anders: I think the State court opinions are somewhat unclear. There some statements that could be taken to be inconsistent with Mathis, but immediately after those statements the state Court said: Well, it's not enough alone for custody that someone is incarcerated on a conviction that's unrelated to their questioning; and we look to the fact that the inmate was told that he was free to leave and he actually felt free to leave. So I think the best reading of the State court's opinions is that they did go through the totality of the circumstances and they did conclude that the Respondent reasonably felt that he was free to leave in this interview. But more importantly, I think the Sixth Circuit went much further than that and established a per se rule that says, no matter what the questioners do, no matter what a prisoner is told -- told, no matter how free he feels to leave, that person always has to be Mirandized. And that extends Miranda way beyond its initial concerns. Voluntary confessions, this Court has recognized, are an unmitigated good. So any time someone confesses voluntarily in a noncustodial situation, the Sixth Circuit's rule applied to prisons would say that that person's confession would has to be suppressed, even though it was given in a situation that doesn't implicate Miranda's concerns at all. I think the Sixth Circuit's rule really arose from two assumptions. One was that isolation alone is sufficient to create custody in all circumstances. And that can't be the case, because we know that an inmate can be told that he can leave, he can be given an initial choice before he comes along for questioning, he can be interrogated in isolation purely because he is waiting to be treated in an infirmary. There are any number of situations, I think, where an inmate could be isolated for questioning, but he would still feel free to leave. Going to Justice Sotomayor's question about whether someone in prison necessarily feels coerced, I think that the Court in Shatzer established that background restrictions incident to being incarcerated are not in themselves sufficient to create Miranda custody. So in other words, they don't create such a huge coercive impact that nobody would feel free to terminate questioning.

Obviously, we also think you shouldn't do that and hold it's one offense for Blockburger purposes. We think, if you're going to say, as Mr. Lora argues, that (j) does not sweep in the (c) penalties, then we think the Court should also make clear, as Mr. Lora argues, that, you know, in part, because of that, given the intertwined relationship between the two questions, these are separate offenses.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M.

To --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: So you've already said that this fails the Blockburger test. That's the government's view.

But I don't understand why that is.</turn>\n<turn>Erica L. Ross: Sure. So we take the Blockburger test as it exists. We think, under the Blockburger test, we have the better reading of the statute. We think it's a greater and a lesser included offense. That's normally one offense. But the natural consequence of that is that the penalty provisions of (c) apply to (j) as well.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: All right. Can we disagree with that part of it without revisiting whether it's one or a different offense? You've said two different things in that. I mean, I didn't understand Blockburger to speak to the penalties in this way.</turn>\n<turn>Erica L. Ross: So I think one of the clues you might look to in the Blockburger analysis, and we think the clearest clue in this case if you come out in Mr. Lora's direction, is whether it's a standalone penalty scheme or it's incorporating another provision's penalty.

Ross: I might have lost you there, but I think what we say as our frontline position -- I want to be clear about this because I think it's extremely important. Our frontline position is that these are one offense for purposes of Blockburger. That is because, you know, (c) -- (j) cross-references (c), they're in the same section, they're part of the same -- you know, they're a greater and lesser included offense, cases like Brown versus Ohio and Garrett, which strongly suggest they're one offense.

So you're -- you're suddenly now asking us as a result of this case to revisit Blockburger and what it says about when there are separate offenses?</turn>\n<turn>Erica L. Ross: No, Justice Jackson. To --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: So you've already said that this fails the Blockburger test. That's the government's view. And I understood Justice Kagan to be saying, can we not talk about that in this case, whether it meets the Blockburger test or not, and still rule in favor of Mr. Lora? And you're saying no. But I don't understand why that is.</turn>\n<turn>Erica L. Ross: Sure. So we take the Blockburger test as it exists. We think, under the Blockburger test, we have the better reading of the statute. We think it's a greater and a lesser included offense. That's normally one offense. But the natural consequence of that is that the penalty provisions of (c) apply to (j) as well.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: All right. Can we disagree with that part of it without revisiting whether it's one or a different offense? You've said two different things in that. I mean, I didn't understand Blockburger to speak to the penalties in this way.</turn>\n<turn>Erica L. Ross: So I think one of the clues you might look to in the Blockburger analysis, and we think the clearest clue in this case if you come out in Mr. Lora's direction, is whether it's a standalone penalty scheme or it's incorporating another provision's penalty. And I think that is how the two are related. Now, again --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: And what's your answer to that question? You say it -- it -- it satisfies the Blockburger test, meaning that they are one and the same, like a lesser included offense, but it also incorporates the other penalty. Is that your view?</turn>\n<turn>Erica L. Ross: I might have lost you there, but I think what we say as our frontline position -- I want to be clear about this because I think it's extremely important. Our frontline position is that these are one offense for purposes of Blockburger. That is because, you know, (c) -- (j) cross-references (c), they're in the same section, they're part of the same -- you know, they're a greater and lesser included offense, cases like Brown versus Ohio and Garrett, which strongly suggest they're one offense. If they're one offense, we think it is necessarily true that the penalties of (c) are read into (j) because all (j) is doing at that point is adding an additional element and it's increasing the penalty.</turn>\n</context>\n<justice>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson</justice>\nGenerate a question that Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is likely to ask next.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson: So why isn't that circular?

Morris: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Circuit recognized a new cause of action based on an elected body censuring a member. That decision is wrong for two reasons. First, it ignores this country's history and parliamentary tradition, which recognize the right of elected bodies to govern their own affairs, including censuring members for violations of governance rules. And, second, it makes the Free Speech Clause into both a cudgel and a shield. The Free Speech Clause undeniably protects a member's right to criticize the body upon which they sit, but it does not insulate the member from the elected body's speech in response. Wilson basically concedes the Board's right to respond to his violations of its governance rules with its own speech when he argues the Board could have passed a position statement calling his behavior inappropriate, indecorous, and regrettable as long as it didn't use the words \"censure\" or \"punishment.\" But the Free Speech Clause doesn't dictate what words an elected body can use to reprimand one of its members, and elected bodies enforce rules with discipline, not position statements. Wilson focuses instead on three additional measures that were included in the resolution of censure, but this case involves only speech. The Fifth Circuit relied on censure alone in creating its new cause of action, and whatever might be true in other contexts, that holding is wrong in the context of this case. Allowing retaliation actions based on censures will destabilize legislative self-governance, forcing courts to referee local political disputes. Judges will be asked to draw unmanageable lines between a politician's speech and conduct or legislative and non-legislative speech. And boards like HCC's will have to shy away from enforcing their rules of governance because of the threat of litigation. This is not the right result.

Giatras: --Yes, it did.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Excuse me, Senator Lautenberg would not have been the drafter of this language.</turn>\n<turn>Troy N. Giatras: The -- Senator Lautenberg does not disagree that he came to an agreement on this language.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: I'm sorry. Are you saying that Senator Lautenberg did not change the words \"misdemeanor crime of violence\" to the words \"use of physical force\" or \"threatened use of deadly weapon\"? That's what he got up on the floor of the Senate and said that he wanted to change.</turn>\n<turn>Troy N. Giatras: Justice, as this Court has articulated in Allapattah, that sometimes there can be a strategic manipulation to secure results.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: I'm not -- we're in -- the question specifically is where did the words come from? I thought that the words came from Senator Lautenberg. The reason I thought that is because he got up on the floor of the Senate and said that's what he did. Now, if you're telling me they came from a different place, what is there in anywhere? I'm open to hearing it, but I couldn't find anything that said they had come from a different place.</turn>\n<turn>Troy N. Giatras: They would have come from the House of Representatives.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: What do you mean would have? Did it language come over to the Senate from the House or not?</turn>\n<turn>Troy N. Giatras: Yes.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: So the -- the -- the language on physical force came from the House? That's what you're saying? I'm just trying to be clear.</turn>\n<turn>Troy N. Giatras: Threatened use of--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: It might have. I'm not criticizing. I want to know.</turn>\n<turn>Troy N. Giatras: --The use or attempted use of physical force or the threatened use of a deadly weapon language, including the words \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" came over from the House.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: This very form that was ultimately enacted was the form that came over from the House to the Senate?</turn>\n<turn>Troy N. Giatras: Yes, Your Honor.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: Making progress. And you're saying that in the House there were some people who didn't want it to extend to beyond 17 States?</turn>\n<turn>Troy N. Giatras: Yes, Your Honor.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: And how do we know that?</turn>\n<turn>Troy N. Giatras: Well, by the mere fact that they -- we don't have them speaking to it, because there was no actual congressional record of them speaking to it or someone taking to the floor in the House of Representatives. It's absolutely silent. We have to, instead, go back to what Senator Lautenberg was saying on the floor of the Senate during this period of time, where he made very clear that what was occurring to his bill that it was dying, that it was being killed and it was being gutted in September of -- early to late September of 1996, the author says that his bill is being gutted and it's dying, and that there are significant staunch opposition from certain forces in order to limit the bill.</turn>\n</context>\n<justice>Justice Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.: Can I ask you this question about the structure of the statute? The statute refers to a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, and then it says that the term \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" means a misdemeanor under either Federal law or State law. And then it says that the term \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" means a misdemeanor under either Federal law or State law that has as an element the use or attempted use of physical force or the threatened use of a deadly weapon. So, if you read that literally, it means that the term \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" means a misdemeanor under either Federal law or State law that has as an element the use or attempted use of physical force or the threatened use of a deadly weapon. And then it says that the term \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" means a misdemeanor under either Federal law or State law. So, the question is, what is the relationship between those two things? And you say that the second one means the first one. But why doesn't it mean that there are two separate things, that there are two separate things that are referred to by the term \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\", one of which is a misdemeanor under either Federal law or State law that has as an element the use or attempted use of physical force or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, and the other is a misdemeanor under either Federal law or State law?<|eot_id|>"}

They're described as officers in Article I who are chosen by the legislature. They also have to be officers if they're able to be covered by the Presidential Succession Act because, under the Constitution, only officers can serve when there's a vacancy in both the presidency and the vice presidency. So they're officers, but they're not offices under the United States because of the Incompatibility Clause, which says that if you're a member of Congress, you cannot simultaneously hold an office under the United States. So that provision of the Constitution clearly demonstrates that --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I -- I --</turn>\n<turn>Jonathan F.

Roberts, Jr.: Justice Kavanaugh.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Katyal. On the statutory language, I'll repeat a question I asked your colleague. It says, the applicant or witness shall have a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal if no adverse credibility determination is explicitly made. I think the purpose of that was that if the only real testimony in the record is from the applicant that -- and the IJ did not say, I think the applicant is lying or make an adverse credibility determination, it would not be open to the BIA to -- to do that. But, by -- and this is what I want you to focus on -- by using the phrase \"rebuttable presumption\" -- I think Justice Kagan was talking about this and Justice Gorsuch -- if other evidence comes in, it's not just the applicant's testimony and you have nothing else, other testimony comes in, then that you just do normal substantial evidence review as the reviewing court. And if the BIA has explained, we think the other evidence is inconsistent with the applicant's testimony and -- and the other evidence is more persuasive or we choose to believe that other evidence, then that rebuts the presumption.</turn>\n<turn>Neal Kumar Katyal: Justice Kavanaugh, we, you know, agree that the Board absolutely could rebut the presumption. The problem here is the Board expressly \"adopted and affirmed the IJ's findings,\" which didn't have that credibility determination. And so the Board never discussed credibility or gave any reason to find Alcaraz noncredible. You know, nothing like what Justice Kagan was getting at about how we don't believe criminals or we believe probation office reports or any of that.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Just put aside this case, and I understand why you're focused on this case. Is that how you think the statutory provision operates?</turn>\n<turn>Neal Kumar Katyal: We do think that the Board absolutely can rebut the presumption. They've got to do so with some work. And, you know, a circuit court sitting on 1252 review would look for a reasoned explanation, so it's got to explain what they're doing and have some reason behind it, just as in any administrative law context. That's all. It's not an onerous standard. It's just one that the government can't meet here.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: That's helpful. Thank you, Mr. Katyal.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Barrett.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Good morning, Mr. Katyal. You said -- I -- I just want to be sure that I understand the ways in which your position is distinct from the government. So it seems like you don't quite buy the government's argument that \"credibility\" simply means is this person capable of being believed rather than I believe them, but I did hear you earlier say something about something can be credible and not persuasive on the grounds that you don't believe the person. So can you just tell me what you mean by \"credible,\" how you understand it?</turn>\n<turn>Neal Kumar Katyal: So we read \"credible\" as capable of being believed and sometimes, and rarely, there will be a difference between \"credibility\" and \"persuasiveness.\" You know, for example, if someone says, you know, I'm worried if I go to Mexico that I'm going to be beaten up, and the judge doesn't think he's lying, thinks it's genuine but, as a result of country testimony by the State Department and others, just thinks that's not right, you know, those are the types of circumstances. Here, as I was saying to the Chief Justice, when a case comes in with a presumption of credibility, Greenwich Collieries says, you know, that really heightens the burden on the agency --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: But -- but --</turn>\n<turn>Neal Kumar Katyal: -- to explain the line.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: -- Mr. Katyal, in the example you gave, I think actually then you and I might be interpreting it the same way, because that's kind of like my child and the UPS man example. On that example, it's not that the person was lying. It's just that they're mistaken based on other outside evidence. So, there, you're right, they may be credible but not be persuasive. But that's consistent with credibility referring to the truth or falsity of the testimony, is the person lying or not, right?</turn>\n<turn>Neal Kumar Katyal: It is consistent. The one point I'd make, though, Justice Barrett, is when you're answering that second question about whether other evidence outweighs or disproves it, it's got to be a reasoned explanation. The agency just has to explain what it's doing clearly and provide some reason for it.

But, by -- and this is what I want you to focus on -- by using the phrase \"rebuttable presumption\" -- I think Justice Kagan was talking about this and Justice Gorsuch -- if other evidence comes in, it's not just the applicant's testimony and you have nothing else, other testimony comes in, then that you just do normal substantial evidence review as the reviewing court. And if the BIA has explained, we think the other evidence is inconsistent with the applicant's testimony and -- and the other evidence is more persuasive or we choose to believe that other evidence, then that rebuts the presumption.</turn>\n<turn>Neal Kumar Katyal: Justice Kavanaugh, we, you know, agree that the Board absolutely could rebut the presumption. The problem here is the Board expressly \"adopted and affirmed the IJ's findings,\" which didn't have that credibility determination. And so the Board never discussed credibility or gave any reason to find Alcaraz noncredible. You know, nothing like what Justice Kagan was getting at about how we don't believe criminals or we believe probation office reports or any of that.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Just put aside this case, and I understand why you're focused on this case. Is that how you think the statutory provision operates?</turn>\n<turn>Neal Kumar Katyal: We do think that the Board absolutely can rebut the presumption. They've got to do so with some work. And, you know, a circuit court sitting on 1252 review would look for a reasoned explanation, so it's got to explain what they're doing and have some reason behind it, just as in any administrative law context. That's all. It's not an onerous standard. It's just one that the government can't meet here.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: That's helpful. Thank you, Mr. Katyal.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Barrett.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Good morning, Mr. Katyal. You said -- I -- I just want to be sure that I understand the ways in which your position is distinct from the government. So it seems like you don't quite buy the government's argument that \"credibility\" simply means is this person capable of being believed rather than I believe them, but I did hear you earlier say something about something can be credible and not persuasive on the grounds that you don't believe the person. So can you just tell me what you mean by \"credible,\" how you understand it?</turn>\n<turn>Neal Kumar Katyal: So we read \"credible\" as capable of being believed and sometimes, and rarely, there will be a difference between \"credibility\" and \"persuasiveness.\" You know, for example, if someone says, you know, I'm worried if I go to Mexico that I'm going to be beaten up, and the judge doesn't think he's lying, thinks it's genuine but, as a result of country testimony by the State Department and others, just thinks that's not right, you know, those are the types of circumstances. Here, as I was saying to the Chief Justice, when a case comes in with a presumption of credibility, Greenwich Collieries says, you know, that really heightens the burden on the agency --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: But -- but --</turn>\n<turn>Neal Kumar Katyal: -- to explain the line.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: -- Mr. Katyal, in the example you gave, I think actually then you and I might be interpreting it the same way, because that's kind of like my child and the UPS man example. On that example, it's not that the person was lying. It's just that they're mistaken based on other outside evidence. So, there, you're right, they may be credible but not be persuasive. But that's consistent with credibility referring to the truth or falsity of the testimony, is the person lying or not, right?</turn>\n<turn>Neal Kumar Katyal: It is consistent. The one point I'd make, though, Justice Barrett, is when you're answering that second question about whether other evidence outweighs or disproves it, it's got to be a reasoned explanation. The agency just has to explain what it's doing clearly and provide some reason for it. That's not --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: But the presumption --</turn>\n<turn>Neal Kumar Katyal: -- that's what doesn't happen.</turn>\n</context>\n<justice>Justice Amy Coney Barrett</justice>\nGenerate a question that Justice Amy Coney Barrett is likely to ask next.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett: -- the presumption of credibility, I mean, it's -- it's a rebuttable presumption. So, I mean, you know, the burden is on the government, I guess, to rebut it. But it's not a presumption of persuasiveness. It's a presumption of credibility. And I think that's consistent with the government's view. And I think what you're saying is that the government has to give a reasoned explanation for why they're not believing the testimony, and that's consistent with the government's view as well, right?<|eot_id|>"}

Alito, Jr.: It seems that there is disagreement within the Executive Branch about it. This case has been structured in an effort to get us to decide this on the broadest possible ground, that there's no argument, that it's just about 101, it's not about any other provision of the Patent Act. Why -- why should we -- why should we do that? We have claims that if patent eligibility is denied here it will prevent investments that are necessary for the development of new drugs or it will lead those who develop the new drugs, new diagnostic techniques, to keep those secret, not disclose them to the public. Why -- why should we jump in and -- and decide the broadest possible question?</turn>\n<turn>Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.: Well, I would -- again, I would point the Court to what the Court said last term in Mayo, which is that the determination of patent eligibility really is a double-edged sword. And it may be that in a -- in a particular case, maybe this case, although we are not expressing a view on it, you could sort the issue out on some of the other criteria, but that won't generally be true, and the proposition of whether you can patent the gene itself is a question we think of fundamental importance, and it raises exactly the two-edged sword concern that led the Court to conclude what it did in Mayo. And Mayo was a situation very much -- I'm sorry.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: General Verrilli, there's an assertion made in Respondents' brief that the United States would be in a singular position. That is, they suggest that in every other industrialized nation this could be subject -- could be patentable.</turn>\n<turn>Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.: Yes, and that--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Is that so?</turn>\n<turn>Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.: --No. I think the picture is much more complicated than that. In many other nations it wouldn't be patentable and the patent law is different from nation to nation. I'll give one example I think helps illustrate the point. In Germany and France, for example, you can get a patent on isolated genomic DNA but only for a particular use. So you would get what is the equivalent of a use patent, which is a patent that we would think under our patent laws is acceptable, too. If you -- just as with the question that Justice Alito asked earlier about identifying a -- a useful substance in a plant in the Amazon, if you isolate that and it proves to have therapeutic effects, you can get a patent on that use of it, but what you can't do is get a patent on the substance itself so that no one else can explore it for different uses and for -- and for different therapeutic purposes or to try to recombine it and turn it into a -- an even more therapeutic -- therapeutically valuable substance. And that's--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: --I understand why you are saying cDNA is patentable as a subject matter.

Alito, Jr.: It seems that there is disagreement within the Executive Branch about it. This case has been structured in an effort to get us to decide this on the broadest possible ground, that there's no argument, that it's just about 101, it's not about any other provision of the Patent Act. Why -- why should we -- why should we do that? We have claims that if patent eligibility is denied here it will prevent investments that are necessary for the development of new drugs or it will lead those who develop the new drugs, new diagnostic techniques, to keep those secret, not disclose them to the public. Why -- why should we jump in and -- and decide the broadest possible question?</turn>\n<turn>Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.: Well, I would -- again, I would point the Court to what the Court said last term in Mayo, which is that the determination of patent eligibility really is a double-edged sword. And it may be that in a -- in a particular case, maybe this case, although we are not expressing a view on it, you could sort the issue out on some of the other criteria, but that won't generally be true, and the proposition of whether you can patent the gene itself is a question we think of fundamental importance, and it raises exactly the two-edged sword concern that led the Court to conclude what it did in Mayo. And Mayo was a situation very much -- I'm sorry.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: General Verrilli, there's an assertion made in Respondents' brief that the United States would be in a singular position. That is, they suggest that in every other industrialized nation this could be subject -- could be patentable.</turn>\n<turn>Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.: Yes, and that--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Is that so?</turn>\n<turn>Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.: --No. I think the picture is much more complicated than that. In many other nations it wouldn't be patentable and the patent law is different from nation to nation. I'll give one example I think helps illustrate the point. In Germany and France, for example, you can get a patent on isolated genomic DNA but only for a particular use. So you would get what is the equivalent of a use patent, which is a patent that we would think under our patent laws is acceptable, too. If you -- just as with the question that Justice Alito asked earlier about identifying a -- a useful substance in a plant in the Amazon, if you isolate that and it proves to have therapeutic effects, you can get a patent on that use of it, but what you can't do is get a patent on the substance itself so that no one else can explore it for different uses and for -- and for different therapeutic purposes or to try to recombine it and turn it into a -- an even more therapeutic -- therapeutically valuable substance.

It's  -- you know, we're not saying, Your Honor, that EMTALA prohibits abortions. So, for example, in California, stabilizing treatment may involve abortions consistent with what that state law allows its doctors to perform. But I think our point with the unborn child amendment in 1989 is that it would be a very strange thing for Congress to expressly amend EMTALA to require care for unborn children, and it's not just when the child -- when the mother is experiencing active labor. The definition of \"emergency medical condition\" requires care when the child itself has an emergency medical condition regardless of what's  going on with the mother.

There are countless examples, Your Honor.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan:  And your theory  -- although the Supreme Court has narrowed the reach of your statute, your theory would apply even if it hadn't?  I mean, it would apply to ectopic pregnancies. It would apply even if there were not a death exception. I mean, all of your theory would apply no matter what, really, Idaho did, wouldn't it?</turn>\n<turn>Joshua N. Turner:  If -- yeah, I think the answer is EMTALA doesn't speak to that, but there are other background principles and limitations like rationale basis review, Justice Rehnquist, the Chief Justice recognized --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan:  But your theory of EMTALA is that EMTALA preempts none of it?  That a state tomorrow could say even if death is around the corner, a state tomorrow could say even if there's an ectopic pregnancy, that still that's a  --that's a -- a choice of the state and EMTALA has nothing to say about that?</turn>\n<turn>Joshua N. Turner:  Yeah. And that understanding is a humble one with respect to  the federalism rule of states. It's the primary care providers for their citizens, not the federal government.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan:  It may be too humble for women's health, you know?  Okay. Thank you.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch?</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I just wanted to understand some of your responses or efforts to respond to some of  the questions that we've heard today. As I read your briefs, you thought  -- Idaho thinks that in cases of molar and ectopic pregnancies, for example, that -- that an abortion is acceptable.</turn>\n<turn>Joshua N. Turner:  Correct, Your Honor.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  And the example of someone who isn't immediately going to die but may at some point in the future, that that would be acceptable?</turn>\n<turn>Joshua N. Turner:  It goes back to the good-faith medical standard, but, yes, if the doctor should determine  -- cannot determine in good faith that death is going to afflict that woman, then no --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  So it doesn't matter whether it happens tomorrow or next week or a month from now?</turn>\n<turn>Joshua N. Turner:  There is no imminency requirement. This whole notion of delayed care  is just not consistent with the Idaho Supreme Court's reading of the statute and what the statute says.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  And the good faith, as I read the Idaho Supreme Court opinion, that -- that controls?  That's the end of it?</turn>\n<turn>Joshua N. Turner:  Absolutely, it is.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  All right. And then what do we do with EMTALA's definition of \"individual\" to include both the woman and, as the statute says, the unborn child?</turn>\n<turn>Joshua N. Turner:  Yeah. It's  -- you know, we're not saying, Your Honor, that EMTALA prohibits abortions. So, for example, in California, stabilizing treatment may involve abortions consistent with what that state law allows its doctors to perform. But I think our point with the unborn child amendment in 1989 is that it would be a very strange thing for Congress to expressly amend EMTALA to require care for unborn children, and it's not just when the child -- when the mother is experiencing active labor. The definition of \"emergency medical condition\" requires care when the child itself has an emergency medical condition regardless of what's  going on with the mother. And so it would be a strange thing for Congress to have regard for the unborn child and yet also be mandating termination of unborn children.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Thank you.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

Roberts, Jr.: We'll hear argument first this morning in Case No. 15-1498, Lynch v. Dimaya. Mr. Kneedler.</turn>\n<turn>Edwin S. Kneedler: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals held that the definition of crime of violence in 18 U.S.C 16(b) is unconstitutionally vague on its face, relying on this Court's decision in Johnson, holding the residual clause in the Armed Career Criminal Act unconstitutionally vague. That was wrong for two reasons. First, the standard of vagueness applicable in an immigration proceeding is not the same as in a criminal proceeding, because the Constitution does not require prior notice that conduct will give rise to removal and also because the immigration laws have long been administered by the executive and administrative proceedings because -- under broad delegations of authority because of the close relation of immigration to foreign relations and national security. Second, though, in any event, under the criminal vagueness standard applied in Johnson 16(b) is not unconstitutional as exemplified by this Court's unanimous decision in Leocal and the more than -- and the more than 30 years that 16(b) has been on the books --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But, Mr. Kneedler, didn't the government argue in -- when Johnson was before us, that if the ACCA residual clause was invalid, then 16(b) would be vulnerable because it was subject to the same central objection. Wasn't that the government's argument?</turn>\n<turn>Edwin S. Kneedler: Well, the -- the United States was responding to the argument that -- that was made in Johnson, which was broader than the Court's ultimate rationale. The -- to the extent substantial risk alone was thought to be a problem, the Court made clear in Johnson that cases involving references to substantial risk are not inherently problematic and, in fact, there are -- there are many such -- such ones. The Court focused its analysis on two different aspects, but they -- but they have features that 16(b) does not have and make 16(b) very distinctive. And, in fact, that's the reason why 16(b) has not given rise to the interpretive confusion that finally led this Court in Johnson to hold the ACCA provision unconstitutional.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: I thought the Johnson, two features at issue were the fact that we were asking courts to imagine what the ordinary crime was, and there was no way to even think about what that was. Your adversary points out, with burglary, if the ordinary crime is during the day, there's one level of risk. If it's at night, there's a different level of risk. The nature of the entry is at question, whether it's forcible or merely walking through an open door uninvited. It may be easier with burglary for lots of reasons, but there -- the level of what -- or what constitutes an ordinary crime was somewhat at the center of Johnson. Why isn't it at the center here?</turn>\n<turn>Edwin S. Kneedler: Because I -- I -- there are several very important distinctions between this case and Johnson with -- with respect to that. The -- the ACCA residual clause spoke in terms of a serious potential risk that serious injury to another person might -- might result. And as the Court pointed out, that created uncertainty about things that could happen even after the offense was committed and injury to people, bystanders or anyone else it could be. Section 16(b) is very different in that respect. It asks whether the offense by its nature presents a substantial risk that physical force will be used against the person or property of another, and that's very different in several respects. It confines the analysis in both a temporal and functional sense to the elements of the offense. You don't look at what conduct might -- might have happened afterward. It focuses narrowly on the elements of the offense because the -- the question is whether the use of physical force might be used in the course of committing that offense.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Well, may I ask, Mr. Kneedler, because this aspect of your brief was confusing to me because sometimes you're talking about temporal, and sometimes you're talking about functional.

If a district judge in that case says to himself, well, look, the guidelines really didn't have any meaningful effect the first time around, that may well be a reason to deny sentence mod -- sentence modification in that context.

Another way to think about it, Justice Ginsburg, is we're not doing any -- we're not avoiding any trumping problem, because we have two statutes that have to work together. One is the mandatory minimum statute and the other is Section 3553(e). And what the Court said is that -- and I think what the plain text directs -- is that the mandatory minimum is set aside when the substantial assistance motion is granted.

Your lead argument in the brief from pages 17 to 41 is to eliminate the doctrine of assignor estoppel, and I guess I want to pick up on Justice Kagan's questions on that. You have Chief Justice Taft, of course, in Westinghouse referring to the doctrine at that point in 1924 as well-settled since 1880, and it's continued without elimination since then. So what -- what is -- I'm not sure I heard exactly what is the special justification and particularly in a statutory case, where, as Justice Alito said, our -- our doctrine of stare decisis is especially strong. So why -- why get involved in overturning something that was well settled as of 1924?</turn>\n<turn>Robert N. Hochman: Because -- because it -- it didn't stay well settled because this Court in Scott Paper very clearly allowed an invalidity claim capping their -- agreed with that characterization of it. The -- so the result is you actually -- the -- the -- the rule -- the rule of assignor estoppel is assignor cannot challenge the validity of the patent. Scott Paper says the assignor can challenge the validity of the patent. So now we have something that's no longer actually a rule. And Lear already -- already recognized this. So, in other words, this is a kind of, as -- as Kimble says, doctrinal dinosaur. It has been whittled away. It has been -- the arguments for it have not only been undermined as a matter of policy, assignors are -- are -- are available to do a very -- a very important public service of exposing bad patents. The argument that it was just a -- that Formica sort of gave -- gave full consideration, I think that doesn't hold up to inspection. It didn't discuss the relevant statutory language. It didn't cite Pope Manufacturing, which was the principal case from this Court 30 years earlier, that it said --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M.

It went through a lot of the lower court cases and, you know, starts with 1880, and -- I guess I'm not sure about that, but let me ask you a different question. In the Respondents' brief, they say that assignor estoppel has engendered serious reliance interests, which is something we also have to think about, and they say -- I just want to get your reaction to -- for decades, millions of patents and applications have been assigned on the assumption that assignor estoppel bars assignors from later challenging the validity of the assigned patent rights. Just want to get your reaction to that.</turn>\n<turn>Robert N. Hochman: Yeah, I -- I think my principal reaction to that is for nearly 30 years there was no case applying assignor estoppel. Courts had said it was dead. Commentators had said it was dead. And for 30 years, between Lear and Diamond Scientific, there was no issue about patent assignments. There was nobody running around claiming that their reliance interests had been undermined. And, true, you know, the Federal Circuit's rule has been in place since Diamond Scientific. But let's -- you know, there's been no discussion of the magnitude. You know, the -- the -- the notion that parties pay a premium so that -- because assignors aren't going to be able to challenge the validity of the patent is pure speculation --</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

So why -- why get involved in overturning something that was well settled as of 1924?</turn>\n<turn>Robert N. Hochman: Because -- because it -- it didn't stay well settled because this Court in Scott Paper very clearly allowed an invalidity claim capping their -- agreed with that characterization of it. The -- so the result is you actually -- the -- the -- the rule -- the rule of assignor estoppel is assignor cannot challenge the validity of the patent. Scott Paper says the assignor can challenge the validity of the patent. So now we have something that's no longer actually a rule. And Lear already -- already recognized this. So, in other words, this is a kind of, as -- as Kimble says, doctrinal dinosaur. It has been whittled away. It has been -- the arguments for it have not only been undermined as a matter of policy, assignors are -- are -- are available to do a very -- a very important public service of exposing bad patents. The argument that it was just a -- that Formica sort of gave -- gave full consideration, I think that doesn't hold up to inspection. It didn't discuss the relevant statutory language. It didn't cite Pope Manufacturing, which was the principal case from this Court 30 years earlier, that it said --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Well, it went through -- I mean, I'm looking right at it. It went through a lot of the lower court cases and, you know, starts with 1880, and -- I guess I'm not sure about that, but let me ask you a different question. In the Respondents' brief, they say that assignor estoppel has engendered serious reliance interests, which is something we also have to think about, and they say -- I just want to get your reaction to -- for decades, millions of patents and applications have been assigned on the assumption that assignor estoppel bars assignors from later challenging the validity of the assigned patent rights. Just want to get your reaction to that.</turn>\n<turn>Robert N. Hochman: Yeah, I -- I think my principal reaction to that is for nearly 30 years there was no case applying assignor estoppel. Courts had said it was dead. Commentators had said it was dead. And for 30 years, between Lear and Diamond Scientific, there was no issue about patent assignments. There was nobody running around claiming that their reliance interests had been undermined. And, true, you know, the Federal Circuit's rule has been in place since Diamond Scientific. But let's -- you know, there's been no discussion of the magnitude. You know, the -- the -- the notion that parties pay a premium so that -- because assignors aren't going to be able to challenge the validity of the patent is pure speculation --</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

So, you know, we've said that stare decisis doesn't apply in the same way in the patent area because, by definition, patents expire. And so, you know, I -- I guess I'm wondering why we should be so concerned about the reliance interests here when we don't in other areas of patent law.<|eot_id|>"}

Going back to something that Justice Alito said, the reason I find it a difficult question is it seems to me that judicial foreclosures, non-judicial foreclosures, fall within both. They -- you know, these people are debt collectors under the language of the statute, and these people are enforcing security interests under the language of the statute. But that can't be right because the grammar of the statute suggests that we now have to kick them out of one or the other. All right? And so the question is, which do we kick them out of? Do we say, notwithstanding that they look like debt collectors, we're not going to treat them like debt collectors, or do we say that, notwithstanding that they enforce security interests, we're going to pretend that they don't? So, when I think about it that way, I kind of think: Well, I don't know, foreclosures are paradigmatic enforcement of security interests. There's nothing that gets more enforcing a security interest than foreclosing on a mortgage. So kicking them out of that one seems a little bit more odd than kicking them out of a very broad definition of debt collectors.</turn>\n<turn>Daniel L. Geyser: Well, a few points, Your Honor. First is I don't think you have to kick them out of the additional definition if they fall in the main definition. If Congress had said, if phrased as an exclusion, instead of an addition, they're trying to capture more people, then I think that that point would have more force. Even if Congress had said for purposes of subsection 1692f(6) only, but they didn't say that, and, again, this is a -- this is a definitional section that's capturing people. You start at the beginning. You're seeing, is this person covered? If they don't fall within any clause, they're not covered. And so, if you fall within the first clause, you're covered. If you happen to also do something that qualifies you under a different sentence, that is not framed in exclusionary terms, then that's fine, but you still qualify under the main definition. And, again, when Congress wanted to exclude people, they did it expressly. And we know exactly how they did it because it follows the additional definition.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M.

Geyser: Well, again, the -- the additional definition will cover people in it who aren't just repossessing cars. It can also include someone who is separately collecting debts, because, again, you can fit under both -- under both sentences.

And to be very clear, what happens at that point, the repo man brings the car back to the creditor. At that point, the -- the debtor still owes 100 percent of the same debt they owed before the repossession.

So I think what your question goes to is, well, what about the -- what about statutes that are exclusively extraterritorial? There are seven of them.

It's 18 U.S.C. 2260, that that provision addresses child -- child pornography offenses abroad with an intent to import into the United States. That provision has perfectly meaningful application for people who suffer -- people who suffer domestic injuries, and for United States enterprises -- United States racketeers who could use domestic enterprises to violate that provision. And even if I were wrong about that, Justice Breyer, I don't think you would use the one provision out of 200 as the basis for saying that the -- the statute that on it -- in the heartland of its application will do lots and lots and lots of meaningful work when it's applied to domestic injuries. The related point, this isn't just the presumption against extraterritoriality. We also have the background common law rule that causes of action to redress private injuries are governed by the law of the place of the injury. Here we have only foreign injuries. Congress legislates against the background common law rule, and just as the cause of action in RICO picks up background common law rules, approximate cause, so too it picks up this lex loci delicti rule, again absent some clear indication to the contrary. When you look for a clear indication with respect to the question of injury, not only don't you find a clear indication of the contrary, you find in the statutory findings in RICO a -- a repeated and specific and exclusive focus on the domestic effects of racketeering. Congress has identified its concern. It is -- it is impact on the American economy from racketeering.

That provision has perfectly meaningful application for people who suffer -- people who suffer domestic injuries, and for United States enterprises -- United States racketeers who could use domestic enterprises to violate that provision. And even if I were wrong about that, Justice Breyer, I don't think you would use the one provision out of 200 as the basis for saying that the -- the statute that on it -- in the heartland of its application will do lots and lots and lots of meaningful work when it's applied to domestic injuries. The related point, this isn't just the presumption against extraterritoriality. We also have the background common law rule that causes of action to redress private injuries are governed by the law of the place of the injury. Here we have only foreign injuries. Congress legislates against the background common law rule, and just as the cause of action in RICO picks up background common law rules, approximate cause, so too it picks up this lex loci delicti rule, again absent some clear indication to the contrary. When you look for a clear indication with respect to the question of injury, not only don't you find a clear indication of the contrary, you find in the statutory findings in RICO a -- a repeated and specific and exclusive focus on the domestic effects of racketeering. Congress has identified its concern. It is -- it is impact on the American economy from racketeering. Certainly no clear indication to extend the cause of action to foreign harms.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Well, that may have been true, or largely true at the beginning, but how about all these amendments that happened after 9/11 which clearly seemed focus on foreign conduct, foreign organization, foreign harm?</turn>\n<turn>Gregory G. Katsas: There's -- there is one amendment that is cited, it's the Patriot Act, which does one thing to RICO. It expands the list of predicate statutes to include one provision. It's 2230 -- 2332b(g)(5)(B) It's a reference to that statute. When you go to that statute, it's a list. The list has 60 or so terrorism-related predicate crimes. 58 of those crimes have domestic application.</turn>\n</context>\n<justice>Justice Elena Kagan</justice>\nGenerate a question that Justice Elena Kagan is likely to ask next.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nJustice Elena Kagan: But then there's a -- there's a second amendment, which is the amendment that adds the statute that you're talking about, and that statute is clearly extraterritorial.

And what happened as a result of that is that the Department of Justice didn't defend that aspect of the statute in litigation. Now, a subsequent President reached a contrary conclusion. But -- but my point is simply that when the President makes a determination that a statute is unconstitutional, it can follow that the Department of Justice won't defend it in litigation.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Sometimes you do and sometimes you don't. What is the test for when you think your obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed means you'll follow your view about whether it's constitutional or not or you won't follow your view?</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: Mr. Chief Justice, I'd hesitate to give you a black-and-white algorithm. There are -- there are several considerations that would factor into it. One of the considerations--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Excuse me. It's not your view. It's the President's. It's only when the President thinks it's unconstitutional that you can decline to defend it? Or what if the Attorney General thinks it's unconstitutional?</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: --No, no. Of course--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Or the Solicitor General, is that enough?</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: --28 U.S.C. 530(d) presupposes -- Congress presupposes that there are going to be occasions in which a statute is -- is not defended because of a conclusion by the Attorney General that it's unconstitutional.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Oh, it can be either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General?</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: It could be, but this is a situation in which the President made the determination. And when the President makes that determination, there are a few considerations that I think would factor into the mix in determining whether enforcement will follow. One of them would be the consequences of enforcement for the individuals who are affected. And so, for example, I would assume that if it's a criminal statute that we're talking about, an enforcement would require criminal enforcement against somebody and -- which would beget criminal sanctions. That may be--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: So when Congress enacts a statute, it cannot be defended, it has no assurance that that statute will be defended in court, if the Solicitor General in his view thinks it's unconstitutional?</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: --There have -- Justice Scalia--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Is that right?</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: --there have been occasions in the past.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Yes or no?</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: Yes. Yes, it's true. And 28 U.S.C. 530(d) exactly presupposes that. That's the exact occasion in which that process is -- is occasioned. Congress knew that this would happen. Now, it can happen also when -- in the rare instance in which the President himself makes that determination. And I don't think that the take-care clause responsibility has this all or nothing capacity to it. It can be that the President decides--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Mr. Srinivasan--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: It's not what the OLC opinion said, by the way.</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: --It can be that the President decides to enforce it. That's what happened in Lovett and that's the course of events that was sought -- that happened in Chadha. And there's--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: --But when the Government -- when the -- when the case is adjudicated in the first instance -- we're talking here about appellate authority.</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: --Correct.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: The Government sometimes loses cases in the first instance and then it doesn't appeal. If it agrees with the result that the court reached, it doesn't appeal and then the judgment in the first instance where there was adversity is -- is the last word. So, when does the Government decide, yes, we agree with the -- the adjudication in the court of first instance and so we'll leave it there, and when does it say, yeah, we agree, but we want higher authority to participate?</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: Well, there are -- there are a number of considerations that could factor into it, Justice Ginsburg. You're right that either of those scenarios is possible. The reason that the Government appealed in this case is because the President made the determination that this statute would continue to be enforced, and that was out of respect for the Congress that enacted the law and the President who signed it, and out of respect for the role of the judiciary in saying what the law is. The point of taking an appeal here is that the Government suffered an injury because a judgment was entered against the Government in the court of appeals.

What is the test for when you think your obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed means you'll follow your view about whether it's constitutional or not or you won't follow your view?</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: Mr. Chief Justice, I'd hesitate to give you a black-and-white algorithm. There are -- there are several considerations that would factor into it. One of the considerations--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Excuse me. It's not your view. It's the President's. It's only when the President thinks it's unconstitutional that you can decline to defend it? Or what if the Attorney General thinks it's unconstitutional?</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: --No, no. Of course--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Or the Solicitor General, is that enough?</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: --28 U.S.C. 530(d) presupposes -- Congress presupposes that there are going to be occasions in which a statute is -- is not defended because of a conclusion by the Attorney General that it's unconstitutional.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Oh, it can be either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General?</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: It could be, but this is a situation in which the President made the determination. And when the President makes that determination, there are a few considerations that I think would factor into the mix in determining whether enforcement will follow. One of them would be the consequences of enforcement for the individuals who are affected. And so, for example, I would assume that if it's a criminal statute that we're talking about, an enforcement would require criminal enforcement against somebody and -- which would beget criminal sanctions. That may be--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: So when Congress enacts a statute, it cannot be defended, it has no assurance that that statute will be defended in court, if the Solicitor General in his view thinks it's unconstitutional?</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: --There have -- Justice Scalia--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Is that right?</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: --there have been occasions in the past.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Yes or no?</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: Yes. Yes, it's true. And 28 U.S.C. 530(d) exactly presupposes that. That's the exact occasion in which that process is -- is occasioned. Congress knew that this would happen. Now, it can happen also when -- in the rare instance in which the President himself makes that determination. And I don't think that the take-care clause responsibility has this all or nothing capacity to it. It can be that the President decides--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Mr. Srinivasan--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: It's not what the OLC opinion said, by the way.</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: --It can be that the President decides to enforce it. That's what happened in Lovett and that's the course of events that was sought -- that happened in Chadha. And there's--</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: --But when the Government -- when the -- when the case is adjudicated in the first instance -- we're talking here about appellate authority.</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: --Correct.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: The Government sometimes loses cases in the first instance and then it doesn't appeal. If it agrees with the result that the court reached, it doesn't appeal and then the judgment in the first instance where there was adversity is -- is the last word. So, when does the Government decide, yes, we agree with the -- the adjudication in the court of first instance and so we'll leave it there, and when does it say, yeah, we agree, but we want higher authority to participate?</turn>\n<turn>Sri Srinivasan: Well, there are -- there are a number of considerations that could factor into it, Justice Ginsburg. You're right that either of those scenarios is possible. The reason that the Government appealed in this case is because the President made the determination that this statute would continue to be enforced, and that was out of respect for the Congress that enacted the law and the President who signed it, and out of respect for the role of the judiciary in saying what the law is. The point of taking an appeal here is that the Government suffered an injury because a judgment was entered against the Government in the court of appeals.

Now, Justice Scalia, I believe your point is at some point if this is on private land and the government is not making any efforts to further this display, that it couldn't possibly be that the injunction forbids that.

Roberts, Jr.: Thank you, counsel.</turn>\n<turn>Eric J. Feigin: Well, what am I not considering?</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Thank you.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: But if -- if I can understand, Mr. Feigin, your position and why it is that you're not supporting the State as you do in most cases. I'm -- I'm -- I'm just going to read you a -- a portion of the testimony and you tell me whether this is appropriate or not and, you know, whether -- oh, that -- that's fine or no, that's the reason why we're not supporting the State as we usually do. So this is after Mr. Longoni gets up and they establish that he's reviewed the -- the Rast report and also the Rast notes. So the -- the prosecutor says: Did you notice whether the policies and practices that you've just described were followed? Because he's also described the lab's policies and practices. And he says: Yes. Prosecutor: Were they followed? Yes. From your review of the lab notes in this case, can you tell me what scientific method was used to analyze Item 26? Answer: Yes. The microscopic examination and the chemical color test were used. Question: That was done in this case? Answer: Yes, it was. Question: Was there a blank done to prevent contamination? Answer: According to the notes, yes. Now is that the kind of thing that you think there's no other -- that there's nothing else going on there than the truth of the matter asserted?</turn>\n<turn>Eric J. Feigin: So, for that, Justice Kagan, I'm going to go with Option B. That is why we are not supporting the State as we usually would. But I'd emphasize that if there were more --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Because explain that a little bit further. I mean, get to the second part of your answer. I don't mean to cut you off. But that is why you're not on the other side, because what?</turn>\n<turn>Eric J. Feigin: Well, so, as I was explaining in response to the Chief Justice, we do think that you could introduce circumstantial evidence about what procedures and tests might have -- were likely run in a particular case by just saying every time we get something that we think might be methamphetamine --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Yeah, I understand that, but I was asking --</turn>\n<turn>Eric J. Feigin: They went much further here, and we don't think that's the way this should come in, and that's not how we would try to introduce it in federal court or, if we did, we'd have someone who could testify from personal knowledge to that. There, you might have a problem, and that's not even the kind of thing we necessarily think you could get in not for the truth of the matter asserted. The kinds of things you might be able to get in not for the truth of the matter asserted, to take a couple of -- of simpler conceptual examples, are, number one, you could imagine some ballistics evidence where one expert does it by taking some measurements and calculating based on math and another expert sets up some sort of experimental setup. The jury might not be able to understand the -- either the math or the experimental physics, but they might have some intuition as to which methodology they thought was more reliable. Another example might be a case where both the --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Mr. Feigin, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but --</turn>\n<turn>Eric J. Feigin: I'm sorry.

So I -- I agree that there is a lot of overlap. And, obviously, under Steel Co. and Senken, you can do prudential ripeness before the merits because it's -- it's a threshold doctrine. So nothing requires the Court to do Article III rather than to do it as a prudential matter.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Thank you, General.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Barrett.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Good morning, General Wall. I'm going to let you talk about the merits for a minute here. You know, as Justice Breyer said, a lot of the historical evidence and longstanding practice really cuts against your position. And, you know, there's evidence that in the founding era, an inhabitant was a dweller who lives or resides in a place. You do have this Vattel quote that defines an inhabitant as a -- distinguished from a citizen, as a stranger who's permitted to settle and stay in the country. Do you think that Vattel quote is your best evidence?</turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey B. Wall: Well, if you look only at the founding, I think the Vattel quote is good. I think Madison in Federalist 42, when he talks about a state allowing you to become an inhabitant, is fairly powerful. And what I'd say is, look, there isn't a lot of attention given to the specific question of illegal aliens for the first half of the country for obvious reasons, but the Court does have to deal with the residence or dwelling question in other statutes. And the answer it consistently comes back with is, if you've entered illegally, you are not treated as if you're dwelling or residing here; you're treated as if you're stopped at the border. And the other side doesn't really have any answer to why those cases shouldn't equally apply here and say, look, if the test is usual or settled resident, you're not thought to be a resident, and even if you are, there's nothing usual or settled about your residence if your presence is violating federal law and the sovereign hasn't agreed to let you stay.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: But, if -- if an undocumented person has been in the country for, say, 20 years, you know, even if illegally, as you say, why would some person not have a -- such a person not have a settled residence here?</turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey B. Wall: So take long-term embassy personnel, so somebody who's worked at an embassy for 15 or 20 years, Justice Barrett. That person certainly has ties to the community, and yet we have excluded them in some past censuses because they're not the sort of ties, just as with illegal aliens, that amount to residence or dwelling or what Franklin calls allegiance or an enduring tie. And so too federal personnel overseas. They're not residing here. They may spend years at a time abroad, but we still think they have the kind of tie that counts here. And so I think -- I'm not disputing at all that illegal aliens form ties to the community in -- in the sense you're talking about. But they're not the sort of ties that are sufficient to qualify you within the apportionment base because they don't count for residence or dwelling within the meaning of these federal statutes.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: But you concede that illegal aliens have never been excluded as a category from the census?</turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey B. Wall: Well, yes, we have taken account of alienage in certain ways before, but, yes, and that's the best argument on the other side. There is a historical practice. And if we didn't have Franklin, it could be tougher for us. But we know from Franklin that the fact that you've got a fairly unbroken practice doesn't necessarily mean it's constitutionally compelled. They need some evidence that that has to be the rule as a constitutional or statutory matter, and that's what they don't have. They have a bunch of historical evidence that they -- that the founders and the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment didn't want to limit it to citizens or voters, completely agreed with -- with all of that. But what they don't have is any evidence that they specifically wanted to include illegal aliens because they thought even if you came here in violation of the law, you were nevertheless an inhabitant.

Our position is that DHS can permissibly take account of its detention capacity in determining that there is a significant public benefit from releasing a low-priority individual who's not a flight risk, who doesn't have a criminal history, if that would preserve a bed space for someone who's a higher priority under our detention policies.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: But you're saying we don't need -- or you don't need to argue for residual discretion because you're not using any residual discretion?

So the BIA has said make that discretionary judgment, make that predictive and comparative judgment, and -- and that's it. That's -- there's no legal element to that conclusion.

The government said, you know, there are mixed questions and then there are mixed questions. There are mixed questions that are really super factual. And we accepted that distinction when it came to standards of review in Lakeridge, but we specifically did not accept it when it came to this question. We said, you know what, we don't really care if it's primarily factual. We don't really care if it involves a lot of judgment calls. We don't really care if you have to really kind of search for the legal standard in the inquiry. As long as there is that legal standard and as long as all the fact-finding that you do and all the fact-weighing that you do eventually has to satisfy that legal standard, and the question is whether it does, it's a mixed question and it's reviewable.

In 1925, the word \"stay\" was just not categorically inconsistent with a dismissal.

If the court has dismissed without prejudice, the durational  language dictates when the case can return to court. The durational language was also  necessary to establish that any non-arbitrable claims, which cannot be dismissed, may be  litigated in court when the section is over. But Section 3 is not a command to the court to retain jurisdiction for the duration of the arbitration. It does not say you m ust retain jurisdiction. When Congress wanted courts to retain jurisdiction, as it did in Section 8, it said \"retain jurisdiction,\" and it would not have needed to say \"retain jurisdiction\" in Section 8 if Section 3 already required the court to retain jurisdiction. As to the proviso that a stay applicant not be in default, that makes perfect sense on our reading also. If a plaintiff starts by filing an arbitration proceeding, that's the first thing, the defendant then refuses to arbitrate, the plaintiff can then file in court under Section 4. The proviso says when the defendant says, hold on, wait a minute, you need to  arbitrate, the proviso says, no, the defendant cannot force an arbitration because the defendant is in fault.

The durational language was also  necessary to establish that any non-arbitrable claims, which cannot be dismissed, may be  litigated in court when the section is over. But Section 3 is not a command to the court to retain jurisdiction for the duration of the arbitration. It does not say you m ust retain jurisdiction. When Congress wanted courts to retain jurisdiction, as it did in Section 8, it said \"retain jurisdiction,\" and it would not have needed to say \"retain jurisdiction\" in Section 8 if Section 3 already required the court to retain jurisdiction. As to the proviso that a stay applicant not be in default, that makes perfect sense on our reading also. If a plaintiff starts by filing an arbitration proceeding, that's the first thing, the defendant then refuses to arbitrate, the plaintiff can then file in court under Section 4. The proviso says when the defendant says, hold on, wait a minute, you need to  arbitrate, the proviso says, no, the defendant cannot force an arbitration because the defendant is in fault. Similarly, if the plaintiff begins in court and then the court dismisses without prejudice and the defendant then defaults, the  proviso says that the plaintiff has a free pass for the  --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Okay.

Hettich: Yeah, the -- the impact is very significant, Your Honor, particularly on these hospitals, our safety net hospitals. As amici point out, safety net hospitals have much thinner margins than hospitals in general, where a couple of percent -- I know my friend on the other side said, oh, you know, it's just a percent or two. For these hospitals, that can be the difference between keeping their doors open or closed.

It's not -- if you ask -- if you ask the question would their DSH payments increase or decrease by treating these indigent exhausted day patients or stay the same -- three parts -- do their DSH payments increase, decrease, or stay the same, the answer is their DSH payments decrease. They get less DSH payments for treating these patients. And the proof is that it decreases the Medicare fraction, right? By treating these patients, it has no effect on the Medicaid fraction. They're already excluded under the Secretary's policy. What does it do to the Medicare fraction? It decreases it. So it leads to a net loss in DSH payments. It's not that they stay the same or they go up and not -- but don't go up as much as we'd like. It's that they actually go down. The agency has turned it on its head. It turned what's supposed to be an incentive, as this Court held in Allina, to treat inpatients and turned it into a disincentive. You'll get less money.

Kavanaugh: To pick up on Justice Alito's questions from earlier and ask you about assertion made in the amicus brief of the Western Water Users and just to get the United States' assessment of them. That amicus brief says the reduction of available water would necessarily come at the expense of existing allocation holders, particularly from the Central Arizona Project, which delivers water to 80 percent of the state's population. This amicus brief says that would have severe negative consequences for Arizona, its businesses, and its agricultural and industrial sectors, and would strike at the heart of the social and economic livelihood of Arizona, with dire consequences. I'm not saying I agree with that. I just want -- that's an assertion in the amicus brief. I want your assessment of the implications.</turn>\n<turn>Frederick Liu: Yeah, it is -- it is true that, basically, all the water in the Lower Basin is allocated. And I guess, to respond to that directly, Congress has set aside in the 2004 Arizona Water Settlements Act 6411 acre feet of water for a future water settlement out of the Central Arizona Project for the Navajo Nation. That is water that would require additional congressional action to allow the Navajo Nation to use. If they were to use that water, it wouldn't affect -- I don't think it would affect necessarily all the other users because that's -- that's why that's already been set aside. And so I think the fact that Congress has done that just reinforces where this dispute belongs. It doesn't belong in the courts. It belongs in front of the political branches, which have focused on these sorts of issues.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: A different tack.

Our filing in opposition --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: The ultimate consent decree specifically says that it doesn't resolve the rights of any Indian tribe except as expressly provided in the consent decree, and that does not include the Navajo, right?</turn>\n<turn>Frederick Liu: Correct. And that -- and I think --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Thank you.</turn>\n<turn>Frederick Liu: -- that's partly why the Navajo can bring a motion to reopen the decree if they want to.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Well, except for you're going to oppose it again. You just made that clear standing at the lectern.</turn>\n<turn>Frederick Liu: Well, I don't know if we're going to -- I think it --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: And -- and so what remedy do they have --</turn>\n<turn>Frederick Liu: I think --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: -- other than to say, okay, if you're going to assert the right to control that litigation and -- and -- and adjudicate our bundle of sticks, we can at least pursue litigation to try to force you to do that.</turn>\n<turn>Frederick Liu: I'm not saying we would oppose it or not. I'm just saying, you know, we'll make that determination based on the substance of the motion. But the point is we do not control what the Navajo Nation does with its water rights. They can vindicate them on their own. They are a sovereign nation.</turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Kavanaugh?</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: To pick up on Justice Alito's questions from earlier and ask you about assertion made in the amicus brief of the Western Water Users and just to get the United States' assessment of them. That amicus brief says the reduction of available water would necessarily come at the expense of existing allocation holders, particularly from the Central Arizona Project, which delivers water to 80 percent of the state's population. This amicus brief says that would have severe negative consequences for Arizona, its businesses, and its agricultural and industrial sectors, and would strike at the heart of the social and economic livelihood of Arizona, with dire consequences. I'm not saying I agree with that. I just want -- that's an assertion in the amicus brief. I want your assessment of the implications.</turn>\n<turn>Frederick Liu: Yeah, it is -- it is true that, basically, all the water in the Lower Basin is allocated. And I guess, to respond to that directly, Congress has set aside in the 2004 Arizona Water Settlements Act 6411 acre feet of water for a future water settlement out of the Central Arizona Project for the Navajo Nation. That is water that would require additional congressional action to allow the Navajo Nation to use. If they were to use that water, it wouldn't affect -- I don't think it would affect necessarily all the other users because that's -- that's why that's already been set aside. And so I think the fact that Congress has done that just reinforces where this dispute belongs. It doesn't belong in the courts. It belongs in front of the political branches, which have focused on these sorts of issues.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: A different tack. The Ninth Circuit decision is barely defended by the Navajo Nation. What should we do with that? I mean, one option sometimes is, well, we'll just --</turn>\n<turn>Frederick Liu: Yeah.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: -- send it back to the Ninth Circuit because none of the arguments that persuaded the Ninth Circuit are being re-upped here.</turn>\n<turn>Frederick Liu: Right. I -- I think the only issue that's really in dispute at this point is the interpretation of the 1849 and 1868 treaties. And we would urge the Court to decide the issue of that interpretation for all the usual reasons this Court decides issues because it was addressed below, Pet. App. 31, the Ninth Circuit did address these provisions of the treaties, because the issue has been fully briefed here, because it is a purely legal issue, and, frankly, because we think the issue is straightforward.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M.

Green: Well, I think, Your Honor, in those circumstances, that's where the flagrancy inquiry actually does the work of deterrence. Because as this Court has explained, to be appropriate, suppression must yield appreciable deterrence. There may be some additional marginal deterrence that suppressing everything following an event like this would yield, but that's never been enough under this Court's precedence.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Don't you think it's enough of a deterrent to say to a police officer in this situation, you should have reasonable suspicion? You know the Fourth Amendment requires it. So before you do an intrusive act demanding identification, you do what you're permitted to do, which is just to ask the person whether they'll talk to you. Don't you think that that would improve the relationship between the public and the police? Wouldn't that be the appropriate encouragement we would give, if we don't let police do these things in questionable situations?</turn>\n<turn>Tyler R. Green: Well, Your Honor, I think that's what the -- the existing rule on the exclusionary rule does. It encourages officers to comport with the Fourth Amendment. This applies to --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: We're begrudging them now from doing that. We're saying if you have questionable probable cause, go ahead and do it because we're not going to make you take that extra step of just merely stopping someone and saying, will you talk to me, please.</turn>\n<turn>Tyler R. Green: No. I don't think so, Your Honor. I think, again, because there are two predicate steps that must be -- that must happen before this exception would apply. And the officer, before the stop, can't count on either one. That's why when -- when we are talking about conduct here that is -- that is admittedly a violation of the Fourth Amendment, but low culpability, that's where the -- the additional marginal deterrence that would come from suppression doesn't do its work. And with respect to the particular type of intervening circumstance here, this is a -- a compelling intervening circumstance of the type that this Court identified in its -- in its holding in Johnson v. Louisiana. This --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Mr. Green, you make a point that a person's name is not suppressible, and evidence derived from just knowing the name is not suppressible. If you're right about that, then the police could stop anyone and say, whether I have reasonable suspicion or not, I want to know your name -- and that's not suppressible -- then does the warrant check, which you say is intervening circumstance. So it seems that your argument is -- is arming the police with asking every person what is your name and doing a warrant check.</turn>\n<turn>Tyler R. Green: Well, Your Honor, it is, of course, that's one of the purposes of a Terry stop, of an investigatory stop, is to try to find a person's name.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: I thought you needed reasonable suspicion.</turn>\n<turn>Tyler R.

That's right.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: This is a case where you're telling us reasonable suspicion or not, the name, a person's name, is not suppressible.</turn>\n<turn>Tyler R. Green: That's right, Your Honor. But it is admittedly the but-for link between the initial predicate unlawful stop, and the later discovery of the warrant, and the arrest on the warrant, which is the intervening circumstance. That's why, Your Honor, we -- we think this is -- this falls comfortably within this Court's prior attenuation jurisprudence. Just like the --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: So what is an intervening circumstance, in your view? What is your test for what it is?</turn>\n<turn>Tyler R.

That is, it's any means sufficiently distinguishable from a predicate unlawful act, such that suppressing evidence seized after it would not yield appreciable deterrence. And this Court's cases --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Okay. And your view is that we should look at the question of whether something is an intervening circumstance through the deterrence lens. That makes a lot of sense. We look at everything through a deterrence lens with respect to the exclusionary rule.

Green: Well, I think, Your Honor, in those circumstances, that's where the flagrancy inquiry actually does the work of deterrence. Because as this Court has explained, to be appropriate, suppression must yield appreciable deterrence. There may be some additional marginal deterrence that suppressing everything following an event like this would yield, but that's never been enough under this Court's precedence.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Don't you think it's enough of a deterrent to say to a police officer in this situation, you should have reasonable suspicion? You know the Fourth Amendment requires it. So before you do an intrusive act demanding identification, you do what you're permitted to do, which is just to ask the person whether they'll talk to you. Don't you think that that would improve the relationship between the public and the police? Wouldn't that be the appropriate encouragement we would give, if we don't let police do these things in questionable situations?</turn>\n<turn>Tyler R. Green: Well, Your Honor, I think that's what the -- the existing rule on the exclusionary rule does. It encourages officers to comport with the Fourth Amendment. This applies to --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: We're begrudging them now from doing that. We're saying if you have questionable probable cause, go ahead and do it because we're not going to make you take that extra step of just merely stopping someone and saying, will you talk to me, please.</turn>\n<turn>Tyler R. Green: No. I don't think so, Your Honor. I think, again, because there are two predicate steps that must be -- that must happen before this exception would apply. And the officer, before the stop, can't count on either one. That's why when -- when we are talking about conduct here that is -- that is admittedly a violation of the Fourth Amendment, but low culpability, that's where the -- the additional marginal deterrence that would come from suppression doesn't do its work. And with respect to the particular type of intervening circumstance here, this is a -- a compelling intervening circumstance of the type that this Court identified in its -- in its holding in Johnson v. Louisiana. This --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Mr. Green, you make a point that a person's name is not suppressible, and evidence derived from just knowing the name is not suppressible. If you're right about that, then the police could stop anyone and say, whether I have reasonable suspicion or not, I want to know your name -- and that's not suppressible -- then does the warrant check, which you say is intervening circumstance. So it seems that your argument is -- is arming the police with asking every person what is your name and doing a warrant check.</turn>\n<turn>Tyler R. Green: Well, Your Honor, it is, of course, that's one of the purposes of a Terry stop, of an investigatory stop, is to try to find a person's name.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: I thought you needed reasonable suspicion.</turn>\n<turn>Tyler R. Green: That's correct. That's right.</turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: This is a case where you're telling us reasonable suspicion or not, the name, a person's name, is not suppressible.</turn>\n<turn>Tyler R. Green: That's right, Your Honor. But it is admittedly the but-for link between the initial predicate unlawful stop, and the later discovery of the warrant, and the arrest on the warrant, which is the intervening circumstance. That's why, Your Honor, we -- we think this is -- this falls comfortably within this Court's prior attenuation jurisprudence. Just like the --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: So what is an intervening circumstance, in your view? What is your test for what it is?</turn>\n<turn>Tyler R. Green: Your Honor, I -- we think under it's -- it's -- it flows naturally from this Court's teaching in Wong Sun. That is, it's any means sufficiently distinguishable from a predicate unlawful act, such that suppressing evidence seized after it would not yield appreciable deterrence. And this Court's cases --</turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Okay. And your view is that we should look at the question of whether something is an intervening circumstance through the deterrence lens. That makes a lot of sense. We look at everything through a deterrence lens with respect to the exclusionary rule. And that, you know, what we're supposed to say is this -- does this appreciably increase deterrence or not; is that correct?</turn>\n<turn>Tyler R.
