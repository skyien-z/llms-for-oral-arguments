Now, what happens to your argument about the institution of marriage as a tool towards procreation? Given the fact that, in California, too, couples that aren't gay but can't have children get married all the time.<\/turn>\n<turn>Charles J. Cooper: Yes, Your Honor.

That's -- I mean, I know you keep talking about her -- her motivation, she wants to do this to sue. In the same way as it doesn't matter that the person's subjective motivation is to set up circumstances by which they can challenge the discriminatory lunch counter, it doesn't matter that her subjective motivation is to sue. There must be something about whether she's actually experiencing discrimination --<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G.

We just don't think that these facts are comparable to those.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: That she has actually been the victim of an injury and is that -- that's because you say she never -- she disclaimed her interest in going to Maine?<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: So I think there's -- there's several differences between this case and the lunch counter hypothetical.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: Hmm.<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: So, first of all, I think this is more of a generalized grievance like in the lunch counter or Ms. Coleman in Havens Realty. Like, the person was personally the victim of racial discrimination. I think that when you just go to a website to check ADA compliance, that's more of a generalized grievance. There's also no intent to discriminate in this case. I do realize that the ADA considers the disparate effect of facially neutral policies to be discriminatory just as disparate treatment is discriminatory. But, in this case, there's no disparate effect either because she's not using the information. So there's no -- the disrespect of intentional discrimination --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: But that's all --<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G.

Unikowsky: Well --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: -- on the difference between her and a tester.<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: -- I mean, on -- on the -- on the question Your Honor described about being subject to discrimination, I do think this case is properly understood as discrimination against people who are limited from accessing the building, like the purpose of accessibility information on the website is to facilitate accessibility of the building. And so not --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: No, isn't it -- I'm sorry, isn't it -- isn't it to facilitate their assessment of whether or not this building offers services that they can use?<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: Yeah, but --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: So what she's trying -- the reason why there's discrimination is because an able-bodied person can get on the website and it shows that there are 15 rooms available at this hotel, and so they know that there are 15 rooms available and they could go there, whereas a disabled person, unless the hotel identifies that it actually has accessible rooms, can't look on the website and assess the availability of those rooms. I thought that was the discriminatory issue.<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: Yeah, but the problem is that looking at the website is not an end in itself.

And I do think that being the victim of intentional racial discrimination, as in the facts of the Havens Realty case, where the hypotheticals Your Honor has described may inflict in certain circumstances an Article III stigmatic injury. We just don't think that these facts are comparable to those.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: That she has actually been the victim of an injury and is that -- that's because you say she never -- she disclaimed her interest in going to Maine?<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: So I think there's -- there's several differences between this case and the lunch counter hypothetical.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: Hmm.<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: So, first of all, I think this is more of a generalized grievance like in the lunch counter or Ms. Coleman in Havens Realty. Like, the person was personally the victim of racial discrimination. I think that when you just go to a website to check ADA compliance, that's more of a generalized grievance. There's also no intent to discriminate in this case. I do realize that the ADA considers the disparate effect of facially neutral policies to be discriminatory just as disparate treatment is discriminatory. But, in this case, there's no disparate effect either because she's not using the information. So there's no -- the disrespect of intentional discrimination --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: But that's all --<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: -- is absent too.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: -- on the merits. I'm talking about --<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: No, I don't --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: -- injury, right? I mean, those that -- that's whether or not she could actually win the case. You're saying she can't even bring it.<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: Yes.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: And I'm trying to understand why you think she's not injured. And I think -- I think I get it. I just wanted to be clear --<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: Well --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: -- on the difference between her and a tester.<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: -- I mean, on -- on the -- on the question Your Honor described about being subject to discrimination, I do think this case is properly understood as discrimination against people who are limited from accessing the building, like the purpose of accessibility information on the website is to facilitate accessibility of the building. And so not --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: No, isn't it -- I'm sorry, isn't it -- isn't it to facilitate their assessment of whether or not this building offers services that they can use?<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: Yeah, but --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: So what she's trying -- the reason why there's discrimination is because an able-bodied person can get on the website and it shows that there are 15 rooms available at this hotel, and so they know that there are 15 rooms available and they could go there, whereas a disabled person, unless the hotel identifies that it actually has accessible rooms, can't look on the website and assess the availability of those rooms. I thought that was the discriminatory issue.<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: Yeah, but the problem is that looking at the website is not an end in itself. I think it's a means to the end of accessing the hotel. Like the reason you want to know whether there's a wheelchair ramp is to know if you show up at the hotel whether you can enter it.<\/turn>\n<\/context>\n<justice>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson<\/justice>\nGenerate a question that Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is likely to ask next.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nIsn't the fact that she can't assess whether the hotel has accessible rooms, and therefore can't make an informed decision about whether to book a room, itself a concrete harm that she has suffered, regardless of whether she ultimately intended to book a room or not?<|eot_id|>","prediction":"Isn't the fact that she can't assess whether the hotel has accessible rooms, and therefore can't make an informed decision about whether to book a room, itself a concrete harm that she has suffered, regardless of whether she ultimately intended to book a room or not?"}

Kavanaugh:  All right. Thank you.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Barrett?<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Mr. Feigin, just a quick clarifying question. When you were going back and forth with Justice Alito about how this would actually be done as a practical  matter, he was asking you about burden of proof, and I don't think you ever went back to it. I mean, in the old system, when judges were doing this, it was by a preponderance, I assume?<\/turn>\n<turn>Eric J. Feigin:  Correct.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  The sentencing?

Feigin:  I think that it will do two things. It may well do two things. And,  again, for reasons I've stated, this is kind of predictive. I -- I do think it may incentivize defendants to submit this to a jury whereas they might not have before, and I don't know that that's necessarily a particularly beneficial thing as a practical matter because I think very rarely would it actually be the case that these were not  --that the defendant's three prior offenses were not committed on separate occasions. And, second, going before the jury, we might need to introduce different types of proof or it may be harder to acquire everything that we might need. We'd prefer, as I said, not to have to bring the victim back in to say --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Sure.<\/turn>\n<turn>Eric J. Feigin:  -- yes, I -- I can remember, the -- the date is stamped in my brain, you know, October 26th, that's a day I'll never forget because that's the day that that man robbed me, particularly if it's 10 years in the past and memories may have faded. In fact, this kind of inquiry or -- and much more overruling Almendarez-Torres would be a windfall for defendants who have a long rap sheet, as Mr. Erlinger does here, but who -- several of their crimes have been knocked out by various of this Court's or the court of appeals' decisions, and so we have to rely on some of the older crimes as to whi ch it may be harder to produce this evidence or even to find every single state record that we might need, where there would otherwise be no dispute about it because the defendant knows quite well that he actually committed those offenses and what they were about.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  One other question. So Justice Kagan asked you about the four trials the government has already conducted that were bifurcated. Same jury or did you -- was it a different jury?<\/turn>\n<turn>Eric J.

There's no evidence of that here.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: --Is there any responsibility if you -- the numbers are what has been left out so far.

It does not show that there were gender gaps at the stores among comparable people. That's really the fundamental flaw in their case.

{"system_prompt":"You are a Supreme Court Justice participating in oral arguments. Given a transcript excerpt and a Justice's name, generate the Justice's next question in response to the conversation history.","instruction":"<context>\n<turn>Barry Richard: Well, I have two responses, Your Honor, and excuse me if I didn't clearly express myself in my response to Justice Ginsburg's question. But what I'm saying is, clearly, when you tell an incumbent judge that that judge can personally solicit money, that's going to give an incumbent judge, who has far more intimidation power, an advantage over a non-incumbent. And as to weighing which is going to give more or less advantage, it's difficult to answer that question, and generally this Court doesn't find itself in the business of equalizing the playing field in any case. So I don't know that it makes any difference. But the other fact is that we have no evidence in this record or in the literature or in the case law to suggest that this is a factor. It -- under any circumstances. The other thing I'd like to comment, if I might go back to the question that Justice Alito asked me earlier, is I think that there is another linkage here that's important, which is this: If you look at the difference in the impact upon this Petitioner's free speech between sending a letter to one person or personally confronting one person and, on the other hand, sending it to 5 or 10 or 50 people, if it would even be manageable to make a distinction, it doesn't move the free speech needle in this case one iota because there's very little impact on that candidate's free speech. No matter how many people the candidate is talking to, the candidate can still say anything he or she wants to about qualifications, about issues, about cases, about anything he or she wants to. This Court said so in White, and the Florida canon doesn't attempt to put any restriction on it. The only thing it says is you can't say to me, give me money. And this Court has recognized in Buckley and in McConnell that the only communicative value of saying, give me money, is that when you get money, it enables you to broadcast your message more widely. And the Court has said that that only rises to constitutional level when the restriction is go great that you can't broadcast your message reasonably. Here, the committee can raise money, and we have no evidence, again, in the record, the literature, the case law, that--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: And--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Where did we say that? I don't -- I don't know the case that says that--<\/turn>\n<turn>Barry Richard: --That says--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: --That it's only bad if the restriction is so great that you cannot broadcast your message reasonably?<\/turn>\n<turn>Barry Richard: --No, that was--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: What law? That's -- that's the only test, you -- you can have all sorts of campaign restrictions so long as they do not prevent and we're going to sit in judgment about whether they prevent the candidate from--<\/turn>\n<turn>Barry Richard: --No, what I referred to--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: --What -- what case are you referring to?<\/turn>\n<turn>Barry Richard: --What I referred to, Your Honor, is the discussion in Buckley and when it said that -- that the restriction on campaign contributions and the amount of a contribution, that it's -- it's communicative value was in the ability to be able to broadcast the message, and that it only became constitutionally significant if it was so Draconian that the person could not raise enough money to reasonably be able to broadcast the message. Now, that's not the wording that the Court used, but that was the essence of what the Court said.

But what I'm saying is, clearly, when you tell an incumbent judge that that judge can personally solicit money, that's going to give an incumbent judge, who has far more intimidation power, an advantage over a non-incumbent. And as to weighing which is going to give more or less advantage, it's difficult to answer that question, and generally this Court doesn't find itself in the business of equalizing the playing field in any case. So I don't know that it makes any difference. But the other fact is that we have no evidence in this record or in the literature or in the case law to suggest that this is a factor. It -- under any circumstances. The other thing I'd like to comment, if I might go back to the question that Justice Alito asked me earlier, is I think that there is another linkage here that's important, which is this: If you look at the difference in the impact upon this Petitioner's free speech between sending a letter to one person or personally confronting one person and, on the other hand, sending it to 5 or 10 or 50 people, if it would even be manageable to make a distinction, it doesn't move the free speech needle in this case one iota because there's very little impact on that candidate's free speech. No matter how many people the candidate is talking to, the candidate can still say anything he or she wants to about qualifications, about issues, about cases, about anything he or she wants to. This Court said so in White, and the Florida canon doesn't attempt to put any restriction on it. The only thing it says is you can't say to me, give me money. And this Court has recognized in Buckley and in McConnell that the only communicative value of saying, give me money, is that when you get money, it enables you to broadcast your message more widely. And the Court has said that that only rises to constitutional level when the restriction is go great that you can't broadcast your message reasonably. Here, the committee can raise money, and we have no evidence, again, in the record, the literature, the case law, that--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: And--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Where did we say that? I don't -- I don't know the case that says that--<\/turn>\n<turn>Barry Richard: --That says--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: --That it's only bad if the restriction is so great that you cannot broadcast your message reasonably?<\/turn>\n<turn>Barry Richard: --No, that was--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: What law? That's -- that's the only test, you -- you can have all sorts of campaign restrictions so long as they do not prevent and we're going to sit in judgment about whether they prevent the candidate from--<\/turn>\n<turn>Barry Richard: --No, what I referred to--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: --What -- what case are you referring to?<\/turn>\n<turn>Barry Richard: --What I referred to, Your Honor, is the discussion in Buckley and when it said that -- that the restriction on campaign contributions and the amount of a contribution, that it's -- it's communicative value was in the ability to be able to broadcast the message, and that it only became constitutionally significant if it was so Draconian that the person could not raise enough money to reasonably be able to broadcast the message. Now, that's not the wording that the Court used, but that was the essence of what the Court said. My only point here is there's no -- nothing to suggest that Florida -- that Canon 7C(1)'s methodology is such that a candidate cannot raise enough money to be a viable candidate. And so what you're left with is no imposition, appreciably, on a candidate's expressive ability.

Mitchell:  -- and the rationale of that case would be extended to this hypothetical. So I think the way to think of this, Your Honor, is there are going to be easy cases at each of the extremes, and there are going to be harder cases in the middle. The easy case is United States against Camp because that is a situation where the trigger was changed. It no longer is the curved metal lever.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  Right, right,  right.<\/turn>\n<turn>Jonathan F. Mitchell:  It's instead a switch. Everyone agrees with that.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  But I guess -- and -- and your -- and your view is what makes it easy or hard is not the sort of thought of mine that, like, geez, what makes it easy or hard is actually distinguishing those two in the real world, like in terms of what is actuall y happening?<\/turn>\n<turn>Jonathan F.

Mitchell:  What makes it hard is whether it's changed the nature of the trigger in some way. Clearly, that happened in Camp. This situation with Mr. Cargill, there's not even an argument that the trigger has been changed. DOJ at no point in this litigation has argued that bump stocks change the nature of the trigger or change the trigger at all. There will be harder cases in the middle, such as the forced reset triggers and some of these hypotheticals that were discussed in the D.C. Circuit's opinion in Guedes, where there may be a question as to what exactly the trigger is and then how does that trigger function. So, again, going back to Camp, when there's a flip of a switch that turns on a motor and that motor then forces the curved metal lever back and forth, that's automatic fire. That's a machinegun because we now have a n ew trigger, the switch. It's no longer the curved metal lever. So can that rationale be extended to some of these hypotheticals where we talk about black boxes and oscillating buttons?  What  exactly is the trigger there?  Is it merely the button?  Is it the motor that's moving the button up and down?  It's arguable either way. We don't think the Court should resolve any of that, I understand, but for us to take a position on the question, it's all g oing to depend on whether you can extend the holding of Camp to these new situations. The Akins Accelerator is a good example to think about because, in 2006, when ATF changed its position on the Akins Accelerator, ATF initially approved that device in 2002. 2006, it changed its mind. And if you look at the classification letter, their argument rests on an argument similar to what Mr. Fletcher is making today. They cite the legislative history from Karl Frederick and say that \"function of the trigger\" means \"pull of the trigger.\"  That rationale is not going to work if the Akins Accelerator is going to be characterized as a machinegun. What might work, though, is if there's some possible argument to extend the holding of United States against Camp to the Akins Accelerator. Does that spring in the Akins Accelerator change the nature of the trigger?  That's the question that needs to be addressed. If ATF wants to continue to characterize the Akins Accelerator as a machinegun, it's going to need to come up with a much better argument than what it offered in 2006.

It just points you to 3327, and then you have to decide what 3327 means. And I think that must be right because it's just a cross-reference. And it also -- it just -- 3327 -- so 3322(d) can't be doing that much work in any event. I mean, as I mentioned earlier, most of the provisions mentioned -- and I urge Your Honors to take a look at 3322(d) -- most of those provisions stating --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M.

And then, when you get to 3327, if you think the cross-reference takes you there, all you have is a \"may elect\" clause. And the superstructure of the statute then is you have a clear, unambiguous, plain-as-day entitlement under 3311. So the question for the Court is whether a \"may elect\" clause, which is, at best, an oblique way to say something --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Well, the point is I think you have Montgomery. You're pointed -- you have entitlement to Montgomery. You have entitlement to Post-9\/11. You're pointed to 3327 by 3322(d).

Kavanaugh: Those are your two options.<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: -- with respect, nothing in 3327 says that second thing. What it says is you may elect. And then it doesn't say any penalty for declining to elect. So what happens when you have a plain-as-day statutory entitlement under 3311, plain-as-day, but then you don't make an election under 3327, they must be saying that the \"may elect\" clause is an implicit revocation of your 3311 entitlement. And I would respectfully suggest that is just not a linguistically possible and certainly not -- not a natural way to revoke an entitlement. If you look at 33 --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M.

It does not say that that entitlement is subject to making a 3327 election. And I urge Your Honors to look at 3312 for that. And so, again, the structure of our argument is as follows: If you have a plain-as-day statutory entitlement under 3311 and you have a voluntary \"may elect\" clause, it is just not a natural or sensible reading of a \"may elect\" clause, which doesn't impose a penalty for declining to elect, to say that that implicitly revokes a plain-as-day entitlement.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

If you're going to protect the kind of right that is... that is being spoken of here, different from the militia right, the plain language to do it would be \"Congress or the States shall pass no law abridging the right of any person to possess weapons for personal use. \" And that's not the right that is created here. One of the troublesome aspects of viewing this as a right of personal use is that that is the kind of fundamental liberty interest that would create a real potential for disruption. Once you unmoor it from... or untether it from its connection to the protection of the State militia, you have the kind of right that could easily be restrictions on State and local governments and--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: Well, there's no question that the English struggled with how to work this. You couldn't conceal a gun and you also couldn't carry it, but yet you had a right to have it. Let me ask you this: Do you think the Second Amendment is more restrictive or more expansive of the right than the English Bill of Rights in 1689?<\/turn>\n<turn>Walter E. Dellinger, III: --I think it doesn't address the same subject matter as the English Bill of Rights. I think it's related to the use of weapons as part of the civic duty of participating in the common defense, and it's... and it's... it's--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: I think that would be more restrictive.<\/turn>\n<turn>Walter E. Dellinger, III: --That... that could well... the answer then would be--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice David H. Souter: Well isn't it... isn't it more restrictive in the sense that the English Bill of Rights was a guarantee against the crown, and it did not preclude Parliament from passing a statute that would regulate and perhaps limit--<\/turn>\n<turn>Walter E. Dellinger, III: --Well--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice David H. Souter: --Here there is some guarantee against what Congress can do.<\/turn>\n<turn>Walter E. Dellinger, III: --Parliament could regulate. And Blackstone appears to approve of precisely the kinds of regulations here. Now--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John Paul Stevens: The Bill of Rights only protected the rights of protestants.<\/turn>\n<turn>Walter E. Dellinger, III: --This is correct.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John Paul Stevens: And it was suitable to their conditions then as allowed by law, so it was... it was a group right and much more limited.<\/turn>\n<turn>Walter E. Dellinger, III: I think that is... that's correct.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: And as I recall the legislation against Scottish highlanders and against... against Roman Catholics did use the term... forbade them to keep and bear arms, and they weren't just talking about their joining militias; they were talking about whether they could have arms.<\/turn>\n<turn>Walter E. Dellinger, III: Well, the different kind of right that you're talking about, to take this to the question of... of what the standard ought to be for applying this, even if this extended beyond a militia-based right, if it did, it sounds more like the part of an expansive public or personal... an expansive personal liberty right, and if it... if it is, I think you ought to consider the effect on the 42 States who have been getting along fine with State constitutional provisions that do expressly protect an individual right of... of weapons for personal use, but in those States, they have adopted a reasonableness standard that has allowed them to sustain sensible regulation of dangerous weapons.

At the same time, people own some property around that lake and they used to be able to build houses. So here's what they say. You can build one. One.

Burton: When -- and the --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: She was in her 30s. He was 18 or 19.<\/turn>\n<turn>Beth A. Burton: And when he initially strikes -- when Mr. Lanier initially explains his strikes, he does state her age, so he is not trying to say she's 23. He states her age as 34. And throughout, the overall theme was, we don't want younger jurors. We're looking for older jurors closer to the age of the victim, age 79. So I think -- you know, maybe -- I know it's not -- not the most articulate framing of it, but I think it's more of a generational, she was younger. And that, the age, I don't think was a make-or-break factor. Working at Head Start with underprivileged children, a make-or-break factor; a similarly situated white juror also struck for that same purpose.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: But -- but Ms. Burton, wouldn't you agree, in a lot of these Batson cases, you'll have purported justifications, which they could support a valid peremptory strike, right? But that the question for a court is, well, but did they support this valid peremptory strike? In other words, what was the prosecutor thinking? Batson is a rule about purposeful discrimination, about intent. And so it doesn't really matter that there might have been a bunch of valid reasons out there, if the -- if it was clear that the prosecutor was thinking about race. You agree with that, right?<\/turn>\n<turn>Beth A. Burton: I think if his intent was to strike based on race.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Yes, if his intent was to strike based on race, it doesn't matter that he could have had a different intent that would have supported a good peremptory strike. And so the question of whether, you know, someone or other might have been properly struck by -- by a prosecutor isn't really the question. The question is on the total amount of evidence before us, including all these prosecutors' notes, what was going on with respect to each of these peremptory strikes. And then you have to deal with not just, oh, it could have been this or it could have been that, but you have to deal with all this information that what it really was, was they wanted to get the black people off the jury.<\/turn>\n<turn>Beth A. Burton: And -- and I don't think these notes show that. What the notes show, again, with Ms. Hood -- Mr. Hood and Ms. Garrett, they're contemporaneous notes taken at the time of trial as to each of these jurors, are the reasons they struck them. I mean, there's no derogatory comments within those notes.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Where -- where there are, you know, other reasons that are plausible but could be phony, surely it's the -- it's the judge that hears the testimony who's best able to judge whether asserted reasons are phony reasons or not; isn't that right?<\/turn>\n<turn>Beth A. Burton: Yes, Your Honor. And -- and I don't believe that --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: It's sort of hard for us to do it on a cold record.<\/turn>\n<turn>Beth A. Burton: Well, but --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: I mean, it's harder. It's harder, not impossible, but harder.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: And Justice Scalia raises, of -- of course, a good point in the mine run of cases, but not in a case where all the evidence of intentional discrimination was not before the judge at the time.<\/turn>\n<turn>Beth A. Burton: And -- and again, I don't think there's -- I don't think there's clear error here on these notes of racial discrimination. Their strikes are sound as to Mr. Hood. You would not want Mr. Hood on the jury regardless of his race, based on his reasons. The what -- reason that he gives a laundry list, like I said, may well have been because we're in 1987, and you're just putting out everything you can because you're not exactly sure what you're supposed to do.

And the prosecutor, Mr. Lanier, says, I will -- said, I will give my notes to the court to look at en banc if defense counsel will do the same. Defense counsel chose not to do so. That issue was raised on appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court, direct appeal. The Georgia court -- Georgia court found it was work product; it didn't have to be turned over.

You see the point?<\/turn>\n<turn>John Hueston: Yes.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: In your opinion, does everybody -- and, you know, there are dozens of motions pending.

Even though it isn't a jurisdictional rule, it's -- is that -- is that your position?<\/turn>\n<turn>John Hueston: It is our position within this context of a mandatory claim processing rule in the emphatic language that is present here, more so than even in the Carlisle and Robinson cases.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Isn't there -- I -- I may be misremembering this, but isn't there a provision that extends the filing period when the courthouse is closed?<\/turn>\n<turn>John Hueston: Your Honor, there is an exception for accessibility of the courthouse that would apply in that situation.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Now that doesn't help you with intervening periods, I gather that would not toll in that sense, but if the due date is a date on which the court is inaccessible or formally closed, that would get at least that relief?<\/turn>\n<turn>John Hueston: Yes, Your Honor. And the key point here, I believe, is that it is properly within the province of the rule drafters to consider when and in what circumstances the court should have discretion. And here, at both Rule 26(b), and then, to distinguish this as an even stronger example of emphatic language, in Rule 2 in both --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Well, before we leave -- before we leave 26(b), there is a bit of a complication, right?

So what do we do about that?<\/turn>\n<turn>John Hueston: Your Honor, that very issue was addressed in the Robinson case, and that is, with that other issue, can an act be allowed later, the Robinson case found that to allow an act or a filing later would effectively enlarge or extend the period of time, and so, therefore, that would be prohibited.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: The problem with Carlisle and Robinson is that they were well before our explanation of there being a difference between jurisdiction and non-jurisdiction claim processing rules. And we were a little bit loose back then in terms of our textual approach to things.<\/turn>\n<turn>John Hueston: Yes, Your Honor.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Justice Gorsuch's question, though, is a fair one because it's the practice of the Supreme Court with respect to filing of amicus briefs that we don't grant extensions but we take late amicus. And so why can't we look at the exact words of 26(b) and say, no, you can't extend the time, but a court has, as it always has, equitable discretion to take something that's filed late because, assuming that the facts qualify as equitable, and that's open to question, I know, in this case, but assuming, why don't we read the provision as it states, a court can permit an act to be done after that time expires?<\/turn>\n<turn>John Hueston: Justice Sotomayor, let me address -- there were several parts to your question.

Undoubtedly, and as this Court has stated repeatedly in recent decisions, that there was a sort of loose use of the term \"jurisdictional.\" However, and, in fact, that loose use of the word \"jurisdictional\" was, in fact, improperly used in the Robinson case. And that has been pointed out. But the Court in more recent decisions, particularly the Kontrick decision and the Eberhart decision, specifically cites Robinson as still good law, acknowledging, though, the term \"jurisdictional\" was misused, that, in fact, Robinson stands for, as Eberhart said, observing clear limits of the rules. So going back to the second part of your question, the Robinson case specifically addressed the issue that, well, if the Court has not addressed that second portion, an act that could be allowed, if we allowed a late filing, that would, in fact, eviscerate the first proscription and render, in fact, that portion of Rule 26(b) a nullity.<\/turn>\n<\/context>\n<justice>Justice Neil Gorsuch<\/justice>\nGenerate a question that Justice Neil Gorsuch is likely to ask next.","output":"Justice Neil Gorsuch: So what work does that language then do to permit an act to be done after the deadline?","transcript_id":"2018.17-1094-t01","justice":"Justice Neil Gorsuch","full_response":"<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nYou are a Supreme Court Justice participating in oral arguments.

Go ahead.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: No, go ahead.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Would -- if you do go with both, aren't you going to be confronted with the problem that your friend talked about, which, for the same offense, you could get one sentence that says the minimum of 30 years and the other one maximum 15?<\/turn>\n<turn>Erica L. Ross: I don't think so, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice, because I think these -- we're talking about separate counts here. So he's saying that we can bring, you know, a three-count indictment, Count 1 is the underlying crime of violence or drug -- drug trafficking crime, Count 2 is the (c), and Count 3 is the (j). And so, you know, you would then have those sentences. And I think, to go to Justice Kavanaugh's point, you know, that actually -- or perhaps it may have been Justice Alito's point -- that actually may not be more lenient in practice because I think, as in this case, you know, the court here had a (j) in front of it. It, as most, if not all, courts of appeals do, read (j) to include the mandatory minimum on (c), and it said, you know, I think the (c) five-year mandatory minimum here is sufficient given the other counts in the indictment. I think you couldn't do that on Petitioner's rule if these are separate charges and separate convictions and separate punishments because the separate (j) offense would require its own sentence, and that sentence would have to be subject to subsection (c)'s consecutive sentencing requirement in the sense that it, like all other sentences, would have to be consecutive to (c). So I think Petitioner's rule actually is -- is less lenient in a number of cases.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: If the Court were to rule for Mr. Lora on the question presented on the theory that this language in (j), \"in the course of violation of subsection (c),\" does not incorporate all of subsection (c), and the Court were to leave it at that, and the Court were to say nothing about the Blockburger question, which isn't really before us in the same way, what would the government do? Would the government then say, okay, things have changed, we're viewing this differently now, we're going to start charging (c) and (j)?<\/turn>\n<turn>Erica L. Ross: So I think we might well take that course, Justice Kagan, again, because I think that's sort of the natural consequence of treating the (j) as not incorporating the (c) penalties. But I think there's a sort of on-the-ground practical reason why I would counsel the Court against doing that, and that's because a number of courts of appeals have precedent on the Blockburger question. And so I think -- and generally holding in line with the government's view that they're one offense, but also holding that, you know, (j) incorporates (c)'s penalties. And so I think, if you dismantle half of that without dismantling all of it, we could be in a position where courts of appeals, under their prior panel rules, might not think that they could reverse that precedent and would have to go en banc. And it's just, you know, a use of judicial resources that I think is unnecessary. Given that the parties have joined issue on this question, I think it's well presented in the papers here.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Can I just be very clear? You said you would counsel against us doing -- and I want to be exactly sure on what you're counseling us against doing.<\/turn>\n<turn>Erica L. Ross: I appreciate it, and I appreciate the Court's indulgence in my counseling anything. You know, I -- I think what the Court should not do is hold that Petitioner is correct that the (j) -- that (j) does not include the (c) sentencing provisions but leave open whether this is one or two offenses for Blockburger purposes. Obviously, we also think you shouldn't do that and hold it's one offense for Blockburger purposes. We think, if you're going to say, as Mr. Lora argues, that (j) does not sweep in the (c) penalties, then we think the Court should also make clear, as Mr. Lora argues, that, you know, in part, because of that, given the intertwined relationship between the two questions, these are separate offenses.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: If they don't --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: But that's not the Blockburger test. I don't understand.

Roberts, Jr.: Would -- if you do go with both, aren't you going to be confronted with the problem that your friend talked about, which, for the same offense, you could get one sentence that says the minimum of 30 years and the other one maximum 15?<\/turn>\n<turn>Erica L. Ross: I don't think so, Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice, because I think these -- we're talking about separate counts here. So he's saying that we can bring, you know, a three-count indictment, Count 1 is the underlying crime of violence or drug -- drug trafficking crime, Count 2 is the (c), and Count 3 is the (j). And so, you know, you would then have those sentences. And I think, to go to Justice Kavanaugh's point, you know, that actually -- or perhaps it may have been Justice Alito's point -- that actually may not be more lenient in practice because I think, as in this case, you know, the court here had a (j) in front of it. It, as most, if not all, courts of appeals do, read (j) to include the mandatory minimum on (c), and it said, you know, I think the (c) five-year mandatory minimum here is sufficient given the other counts in the indictment. I think you couldn't do that on Petitioner's rule if these are separate charges and separate convictions and separate punishments because the separate (j) offense would require its own sentence, and that sentence would have to be subject to subsection (c)'s consecutive sentencing requirement in the sense that it, like all other sentences, would have to be consecutive to (c). So I think Petitioner's rule actually is -- is less lenient in a number of cases.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: If the Court were to rule for Mr. Lora on the question presented on the theory that this language in (j), \"in the course of violation of subsection (c),\" does not incorporate all of subsection (c), and the Court were to leave it at that, and the Court were to say nothing about the Blockburger question, which isn't really before us in the same way, what would the government do? Would the government then say, okay, things have changed, we're viewing this differently now, we're going to start charging (c) and (j)?<\/turn>\n<turn>Erica L. Ross: So I think we might well take that course, Justice Kagan, again, because I think that's sort of the natural consequence of treating the (j) as not incorporating the (c) penalties. But I think there's a sort of on-the-ground practical reason why I would counsel the Court against doing that, and that's because a number of courts of appeals have precedent on the Blockburger question. And so I think -- and generally holding in line with the government's view that they're one offense, but also holding that, you know, (j) incorporates (c)'s penalties. And so I think, if you dismantle half of that without dismantling all of it, we could be in a position where courts of appeals, under their prior panel rules, might not think that they could reverse that precedent and would have to go en banc. And it's just, you know, a use of judicial resources that I think is unnecessary. Given that the parties have joined issue on this question, I think it's well presented in the papers here.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Can I just be very clear? You said you would counsel against us doing -- and I want to be exactly sure on what you're counseling us against doing.<\/turn>\n<turn>Erica L. Ross: I appreciate it, and I appreciate the Court's indulgence in my counseling anything. You know, I -- I think what the Court should not do is hold that Petitioner is correct that the (j) -- that (j) does not include the (c) sentencing provisions but leave open whether this is one or two offenses for Blockburger purposes. Obviously, we also think you shouldn't do that and hold it's one offense for Blockburger purposes. We think, if you're going to say, as Mr. Lora argues, that (j) does not sweep in the (c) penalties, then we think the Court should also make clear, as Mr. Lora argues, that, you know, in part, because of that, given the intertwined relationship between the two questions, these are separate offenses.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: If they don't --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: But that's not the Blockburger test. I don't understand. So you're -- you're suddenly now asking us as a result of this case to revisit Blockburger and what it says about when there are separate offenses?<\/turn>\n<turn>Erica L. Ross: No, Justice Jackson.

Given a transcript excerpt and a Justice's name, generate the Justice's next question in response to the conversation history.","instruction":"<context>\n<turn>Yaira Dubin:  Mr. Chi ef Justice, and may it please the Court:  The estate's evaluation of Michael Connelly's shares contradicts basic math and valuation principles. According to the estate,  before we can value Michael's shares in Crown, we must first subtract the price that Crown paid for Michael's shares. In other words, the estate's theory is that before you can value something, you must first subtract the price paid for the very thing you are trying to value. That makes no sense. Using the item you're trying to value as a line item in its own valuation will never give you the correct answer, and it doesn't give the estate the right answer here either. The estate's contrary view rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of a redemption obligation. A redemption obligation is not a corporate debt that reduces the corporation's net worth or the value of the shares to be redeemed. A debt owed to creditors reduces corporate and shareholder value. A redemption obligation divides the corporate pie  among existing shareholders without changing the value of their interests. And here the corporate pie was worth 6.86  million, not 3.86 million. And that's true even if you look only at the statute of limitation estate's own incomes. Walked away from the redemption with approximately $3 million in cash, but Petitioner also admits that Thomas walked away from the redemption with $3.86 million in value. And the estate doesn't dispute the Black Letter valuation principle that the interest of each equity shareholder added together has to equal the company's total value. That defeats their position because that means that Crown's total net worth before the family divided the company was 6.86 million. The value of the two equities licenses put back together and that means the estate evaluation of Michael's 77 percent stake in Crown at $3 million came nowhere close to fair market value. I welcome the Court's questions.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Clarence Thomas:  I think what Petitioner is arguing that is that, yes, we took the insurance policy, the receipts of 3.5  million, we paid out 3, and we received the shares, so it's a wash. The 3 million, up to 3 million, it's a wash. So what do you do with that argument?<\/turn>\n<turn>Yaira Dubin:  Sure. So that argument depends on the idea that the $3 million  redemption obligation is a debt, a liability. And that's just not correct. What it is is a promise to cash out one of the existing shareholder's shares. So, for example, in the two sisters hypothetical, on page 37 of our brief, if you own 80 percent of a company worth $5 million, you have a  $4 million stake in the company, a redemption obligation at fair market value would be a promise to cash you out for your shares for your stake in the company. It is not the same thing as the corporation for example owing a mortgage or some other debt. A mortgage or some other debt like that would reduce the value of the company and the value of the -- for its shareholders. That is simply not true of a redemption obligation. And I think that you know it's sort of important that Petitioner concedes a voluntary redemption obligation wouldn't decrease the  value of the company because on the date of Michael's death it doesn't matter whether the  redemption obligation is voluntary or mandatory. $3 million is being paid to Michael's shares, so that's where that money is going. But it is going either whether that is voluntary or mandatory.

In fact, one of the things that the Eleventh Circuit noted is that in the time between when the briefs were written and when we argued the case, this Court came down with the decision in Inclusive Communities, and in that decision, the Court's mentioned that there is a proximate-cause pleading standard that needs to be incorporated.

But instead what we found, and what the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged, is that while the kinds of loans -- the financial crisis was set off by subprime lending. But the kinds of loans that are being offered here have taken different forms, but the underlying practice remains the same, that minority borrowers are getting more expensive and riskier loans that are quicker to foreclosure, and -- and that foreclosure may be as many, for some minorities, seven times as frequently as the non-minority borrowers.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

Breyer: Do we have to go into that, or not? I'm not -- not saying we should or shouldn't, but I mean, do we have to to decide this case, decide the damages, what damages are appropriate?<\/turn>\n<turn>Robert S. Peck: You do not need to decide that. In fact, one of the things that the Eleventh Circuit noted is that in the time between when the briefs were written and when we argued the case, this Court came down with the decision in Inclusive Communities, and in that decision, the Court's mentioned that there is a proximate-cause pleading standard that needs to be incorporated. And the Eleventh Circuit said, we are not going to delve into what that exactly is and remand it to the district court for that decision. And we think that that -- that can play out in -- in the further litigation of this lawsuit.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: So if we include language along the lines that don't worry, it's not going to be very much based on the experience in -- in Baltimore and -- and Memphis? (Laughter.)<\/turn>\n<turn>Robert S. Peck: Well, I just think that the -- you know, the fact that our -- our opponents have indicated that we are talking about billions and billions of dollars and that this is about the 2008 financial crisis, which I also want to deny, needed a response. And -- and -- and with respect to the financial crisis, if -- if the 2008 financial crisis was, indeed, the purpose of this lawsuit, then the statute of limitations, which is two years, would have -- would have ended this lawsuit a long time ago. But instead what we found, and what the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged, is that while the kinds of loans -- the financial crisis was set off by subprime lending. But the kinds of loans that are being offered here have taken different forms, but the underlying practice remains the same, that minority borrowers are getting more expensive and riskier loans that are quicker to foreclosure, and -- and that foreclosure may be as many, for some minorities, seven times as frequently as the non-minority borrowers.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Is there -- is there a difference? I couldn't -- the -- the complaint was not clear to me, anyway, between subprime loans and predatory loans.<\/turn>\n<turn>Robert S. Peck: You -- predatory loans are used as sort of a generic term to talk about a taking advantage of a borrower. Subprime loans are -- are simply those loans that have interest rates that are so low that it looks like it's a wonderful deal until, of course, you look at some of -- some of the balloon payments that are later --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: So are all -- all subprime loans properly categorized as predatory?<\/turn>\n<turn>Robert S. Peck: I believe that the subprime loans that -- that fueled the financial crisis are all considered predatory.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: Suppose you have a business that -- that is losing money, losing employees, because the neighborhood is deteriorating. Do they have a -- a stronger or a weaker claim than you do? They have lost profits from their business because the neighborhood has been debilitated.<\/turn>\n<turn>Robert S. Peck: I think they have a weaker claim. We have a claim that's tied to the fact --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: They are property owners.<\/turn>\n<turn>Robert S. Peck: They are property owners, but they're also commercial property owners. And -- and there's -- there is no -- no damage to their personal property. But -- but here what we are saying is -- if -- if I could step back for a moment. The Endangered Species Act, this Court in Bennett v. Spears, recognized that Article III standing applies to the Endangered Species Act, but you still have to make a claim that's based on an interest in the preservation of animals. You can't make a claim based on discrimination as -- that applies to housing discrimination or something like that. There is some generalized zone of interest that ties the statute to the cause of action. Here I say that the City has a special interest in fair housing and an integrated community that the FHA is designed to vindicate. The employer does not. The local dry cleaner does not. Now, they have this unique relationship to the fact that this is their community, their neighborhoods, their residents, which they zone, and they decide how the property is supposed to be used, and they provide services to every one of these residents, and so, therefore --<\/turn>\n<\/context>\n<justice>Justice John G.

I've always thought that a -- a -- a class of antitrust plaintiffs, all of whom have to pay higher prices as the result of price fixing, could be represented by a -- a consumer who, through an odd chance, bought a thousand times more of the product than anyone else in the class. He just had higher damages.

Well, how does this differ from that? In the examples I gave, are they not typical?

I think, as to the two hypotheticals you gave, the first hypothetical, the antitrust plaintiffs, there might not be a typicality problem there because any differences would be easily calculated, and the court could consider that at the outside -- outset of the case and determine whether there's a viable damages model to separate different individuals out just based on kind of a mechanical mathematical calculation. I think the second example that you gave, which kind of is a liability-type example, in actuality, a lot of courts don't allow product liability-type cases to proceed as a class because individualized damages tend to -- tend to make the named plaintiff not typical or run afoul of other Rule 23 considerations. And, here, in the statutory damages context, the jury is charged with setting the amount of damages within a range. And plaintiffs' specific experience can be relevant to that. So, in a situation like this, where one individual, the class plaintiff, was placed on the stand and gave extensive testimony about his specific experiences, we think that there can be typicality problems there because that isn't indicative of what happened to other class members, and they might benefit from that in a way that they really shouldn't.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

I think the Court in Spokeo set out a number of considerations that may be relevant to injury-in-fact when Congress defines a harm, one of which is Congress's judgment; another of which is whether there's a common law analogue for the harm; and another of which is whether there was a material risk of harm, which might be necessary in some cases but not in all.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A.

But let me shift to something else and ask about the class members' standing to assert claims for failure to provide the information called for by Congress. Mr. Clement says all the information was actually provided, but it was just provided in the wrong form. You may not agree with that.

But let me shift to something else and ask about the class members' standing to assert claims for failure to provide the information called for by Congress. Mr. Clement says all the information was actually provided, but it was just provided in the wrong form. You may not agree with that.

Reaves: That's not our position, Justice Alito. The informational standing cases that we rely on here require -- rely on a denial of information that is statutorily required to be provided.

Roberts, Jr.: Justice Breyer.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: I have the same question, just if you want to say more about Justice Thomas's last question. How is this different? I've always thought that a -- a -- a class of antitrust plaintiffs, all of whom have to pay higher prices as the result of price fixing, could be represented by a -- a consumer who, through an odd chance, bought a thousand times more of the product than anyone else in the class. He just had higher damages. Or a class action against somebody for doing something that would send a victim to an emergency room could be represented by a person who was not only sent to the emergency room but, through an odd set of circumstances, was actually sent to the operating room and had to be and had all kinds of bad -- it's the same basic harm; it's just a lot worse. Well, how does this differ from that? In the examples I gave, are they not typical? Or is -- is the -- is the defendant allowed to say to the judge, Judge, don't take those non-typical things into account, the extra damages, at least not until we find liability; then you can have a class for damages, or don't consider -- I mean, how does it work?<\/turn>\n<turn>Nicole F. Reaves: A couple responses to that, Justice Breyer. I think, as to the two hypotheticals you gave, the first hypothetical, the antitrust plaintiffs, there might not be a typicality problem there because any differences would be easily calculated, and the court could consider that at the outside -- outset of the case and determine whether there's a viable damages model to separate different individuals out just based on kind of a mechanical mathematical calculation. I think the second example that you gave, which kind of is a liability-type example, in actuality, a lot of courts don't allow product liability-type cases to proceed as a class because individualized damages tend to -- tend to make the named plaintiff not typical or run afoul of other Rule 23 considerations. And, here, in the statutory damages context, the jury is charged with setting the amount of damages within a range. And plaintiffs' specific experience can be relevant to that. So, in a situation like this, where one individual, the class plaintiff, was placed on the stand and gave extensive testimony about his specific experiences, we think that there can be typicality problems there because that isn't indicative of what happened to other class members, and they might benefit from that in a way that they really shouldn't.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Alito.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: In Spokeo, the opinion says, \"not all inaccuracies cause harm or present any material risk of harm.\" Do you read that as -- in -- as saying that there is injury-in-fact whenever there is material risk of harm? Do you read that as setting out a legal test for injury-in-fact?<\/turn>\n<turn>Nicole F. Reaves: I don't read that as alone setting out a legal test for injury-in-fact. I think the Court in Spokeo set out a number of considerations that may be relevant to injury-in-fact when Congress defines a harm, one of which is Congress's judgment; another of which is whether there's a common law analogue for the harm; and another of which is whether there was a material risk of harm, which might be necessary in some cases but not in all.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A.

Hungar: Your Honor, I think the \"sufficiently innovative\" is more of a description rather than a test; it's a description of what this Court said in Graham. In Graham itself the Court laid out the proper analysis which is you need to consider in detail, not in the more cursory fashion that the Federal Circuit's test encourages, but in detail the capabilities of a person of ordinary skill and the content of the prior art and the differences between the prior art and the invention, and ascertain... it's ultimately a legal judgment informed by those detailed factual inquiries, whether it is obvious or nonobvious and entitled to patent protection. And in addition I would point out that this Court in Sakraida provided a framework for assessing patents like this one, where each of the elements is set forth in the prior art and each of the elements in the claimed invention is merely performing its already known, previously known function as set forth in the prior art.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Mr. Hungar, I have a question that's sort of along the lines of Justice Ginsburg's. It isn't just the Federal Circuit that has been applying this test. It's also the Patent Office and it's been following the Federal Circuit's test for 20 years or so. What, what is... assuming that we sweep that test aside and say it's been incorrect, what happens to the presumption of validity of, of patents which the courts have been, have been traditionally applying? Does it make any sense to presume that patents are valid which have been issued under an erroneous test for the last 20 years?<\/turn>\n<turn>Thomas G. Hungar: Your Honor, I think that it would make sense because the statute requires it, and as a practical matter it shouldn't make any difference, because the only category of cases in which the result would change under our test is the category in which as a matter of law, in light of the factual issues that are required under Graham, as a matter of law the Court concludes that the difference between the claimed invention and the prior art is so trivial that it cannot be given the protection of a patent. And in those circumstances the presumption doesn't come into play. It's a legal determination; the presumption has been understood to effect the burden of proof, and in the Federal Circuit's view the measure of the burden of proof requiring clear and convincing evidence on the underlying factual considerations, not the ultimate legal determination. But one of the problems with the Federal Circuit's test is that it transforms what this Court made clear in Graham is supposed to be a legal determination. Ultimately it transforms it into a jury question. Because in a case like this one where you have as conclusory affidavits from respondent's experts saying \"oh, this would not have been obvious. \" And that in the Court of Appeals view is enough to create a jury question and then you then have to roll the dice in front of a jury in each one of these cases, except of course the many cases in which the challenger can't meet the teaching suggestion motivation test at all and simply is unable to challenge the validity of the patent, notwithstanding this Court's holding in Graham that it's ultimately a legal determination... admittedly one informed by detailed factual inquiries.

I have four basic points to make this morning. First, the Creek Nation had a reservation. The relevant treaties reserved the lands from sale and solemnly guaranteed the lands for the Creek to govern. The text of both treaties and statutes expressly identified the Creek land as a reservation. Nothing more was needed. Second, Congress did not establish -- disestablish that reservation. Indeed, Congress considered hallmark language of disestablishment and rejected it. Congress initially sought cession yet instead provided only for allotment. Then, when congressional inaction would have dissolved the tribe, Congress instead preserved the tribe and its government for all purposes authorized by law, and it did so against the backdrop of existing tribal authority to legislate over reservation land. Those congressional judgments should be respected. Third, Congress did not transfer criminal jurisdiction to Oklahoma. At statehood, the Major Crimes Act established exclusive federal jurisdiction over enumerated crimes in \"any state of the United States.\" When Congress overrides the Major Crimes Act and transfers jurisdiction to a state, it does so expressly, and it did not do so here. Finally, Oklahoma's rhetoric about disruption does not change the result.

Roberts, Jr.: Well, that makes it seem we're talking about it in justice and fairness. That seems to make it seem a little quirky that these owners are not entitled to treat them separately, while if they -- they just happen to record them in -- in separate names that they would be a entirely different situation.<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: Well, let me explain what the State is trying to achieve in this law. It wants to ultimately phase out substandard lots in the long term. It does not want to interfere with any current investment-backed expectations. So what it says is we're going to have a slow phaseout and it's going to be only triggered by the situation where people end up taking the lots in common ownership. And that will happen in the long term. Most people in this area bring lots into common ownership on purpose. And why would they do that? Because if --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, they won't after today, I mean -- or if you win. (Laughter.)<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: You'll be -- you'll be smart enough to say: Okay.

And -- and then we'll be fine.<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: Well --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Does it really -- does the whole takings issue really turn on that?<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: Yes, Your Honor. Let me tell you why we do think it'll be effective. Because most people bring these lots under common ownership purposefully. And the reason they do that is they want to build a single house up on a bluff, a bigger house. So the reason -- and we think that that will happen over time. It's already happened with eight property owners in this area. So while it is a slow phaseout of lots, it is a perfectly sensible regime. It balances, on one hand, the desire to protect investment settle -- back --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, I would suppose that in my hypothetical, the husband owner on one side and the wife owner on the other side, they can build a common house on the two lots, can't they?<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: The -- the merger of the two lots are bringing into common ownership makes it easier to apply -- comply with other regulatory restrictions on the area about minimum lot size and things of that sort. If you don't bring them into common ownership, then you're -- you're left with the nonconforming structure that's on your nonconforming lot.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: May -- may I have one question? It's a background question. Suppose these people had Lots E and F merged. Then they bought G and H. Can they still build one house, just one?<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: It would depend on the size of G and H, how much net project area. Right now, there's --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: Well, suppose -- suppose they're just like these lots.<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: Well, Your Honor, so right now, it's about .9 --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: If they have E and F, then they buy G and H, can they build only one house, or two?<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: Right, Your Honor, just -- just let me have two seconds. I think I can answer the question. Right now, it's .98 net project area. If Lot G is more than .2 net project area, they can build one house. And then the new lot gets the new net project area. So, basically, in order to have two buildable lots, you have to add up to more than two acres of net project area.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: General --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

Roberts, Jr.: Well, what is? That it -- that it's still treated separately?<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: That if two owns the exact --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, that makes it seem we're talking about it in justice and fairness. That seems to make it seem a little quirky that these owners are not entitled to treat them separately, while if they -- they just happen to record them in -- in separate names that they would be a entirely different situation.<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: Well, let me explain what the State is trying to achieve in this law. It wants to ultimately phase out substandard lots in the long term. It does not want to interfere with any current investment-backed expectations. So what it says is we're going to have a slow phaseout and it's going to be only triggered by the situation where people end up taking the lots in common ownership. And that will happen in the long term. Most people in this area bring lots into common ownership on purpose. And why would they do that? Because if --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, they won't after today, I mean -- or if you win. (Laughter.)<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: You'll be -- you'll be smart enough to say: Okay. Husband, you own F; I will own E. And by the way, you're my successor in interest under E, and I'm your successor in interest under F. And -- and then we'll be fine.<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: Well --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Does it really -- does the whole takings issue really turn on that?<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: Yes, Your Honor. Let me tell you why we do think it'll be effective. Because most people bring these lots under common ownership purposefully. And the reason they do that is they want to build a single house up on a bluff, a bigger house. So the reason -- and we think that that will happen over time. It's already happened with eight property owners in this area. So while it is a slow phaseout of lots, it is a perfectly sensible regime. It balances, on one hand, the desire to protect investment settle -- back --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, I would suppose that in my hypothetical, the husband owner on one side and the wife owner on the other side, they can build a common house on the two lots, can't they?<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: The -- the merger of the two lots are bringing into common ownership makes it easier to apply -- comply with other regulatory restrictions on the area about minimum lot size and things of that sort. If you don't bring them into common ownership, then you're -- you're left with the nonconforming structure that's on your nonconforming lot.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: May -- may I have one question? It's a background question. Suppose these people had Lots E and F merged. Then they bought G and H. Can they still build one house, just one?<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: It would depend on the size of G and H, how much net project area. Right now, there's --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: Well, suppose -- suppose they're just like these lots.<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: Well, Your Honor, so right now, it's about.9 --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: If they have E and F, then they buy G and H, can they build only one house, or two?<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: Right, Your Honor, just -- just let me have two seconds. I think I can answer the question. Right now, it's.98 net project area. If Lot G is more than.2 net project area, they can build one house. And then the new lot gets the new net project area. So, basically, in order to have two buildable lots, you have to add up to more than two acres of net project area.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: General --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: It makes no difference under your approach that the two lots were taxed separately, does it?<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: No, Your Honor. I --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

It makes no difference under your approach that there were lot lines separating the two lots; right?<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: That's right, Your Honor.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Are there other aspects in which the two lots are treated separately that make no difference under your approach?<\/turn>\n<turn>Misha Tseytlin: So with regard to the tax assessor, that was an -- that was an error that the tax assessor made.

In Section 3327 of the same Act, Congress created a generous benefits coordination regime wherein veterans who had earned peacetime Montgomery better -- benefits with post-9\/11 service could trade the unused portion of those Montgomery benefits for Post-9\/11 benefits. My client has no interest in trading his Montgomery benefits for his Post-9\/11 benefits, so he has no use for the three -- 3327 election regime. Rather, Petitioner is invoking his statutory entitlement under 3311 to cash in his second period of service for Post-9\/11 benefits. That second period of service is only eligible for Post-9\/11 benefits. It's not eligible for Montgomery benefits. So there's nothing for my client to coordinate. Now the VA concedes that my client has, in fact, earned a statutory entitlement under 3311 to cash in his second period of service for wartime benefits. But he takes the -- but the VA takes the position that Section 3327's \"may elect\" clause revoked that entitlement until he uses up or exhausts the -- the Montgomery benefits he earned from his first period of service. But, with all respect, a \"may elect\" clause is simply not -- not how Congress revokes clear statutory entitlements and certainly not in the Byzantine manner that the VA suggests. Further, the exhaustion requirement that is a linch -- the linchpin of the VA's interpretation finds no ground in the statutory text and produces absurd results, such as punishing veterans with less wartime benefits for simply having served the nation longer. Finally, the VA's effort to turn a regime plainly designed to help a category of veterans into a punitive regime punishing long-serving veterans has numerous contextual problems, including making 3322's concurrent -- concurrent usage bar surplusage.

How is it that the summonses were close in connection?<\/turn>\n<turn>Ephraim McDowell: Sure. So, for the law firm summons, because I think that's the real delta in some ways between our position, the summons seeking the law firm's bank records, Mr. Polselli was a long-time client of this law firm. He'd made numerous payments to the law firm over time. So, by seeing the law firm's records of his payments, they could figure out what accounts or what entities Mr. Polselli was using to make those payments, and then they could begin the collection process by seizing funds from those accounts or entities. So it's really only one step removed from the actual collection. I mean, direct connection is just kind of a phrase that they're using, but it doesn't really have any content. I think the idea here is that this actually was fairly -- there is a fairly close nexus because they were looking for this account information and they could have begun the process of issuing a notice of levy from those accounts.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: And could -- could I ask you -- you -- there's been some talk about, oh, it's the IRS, they just think that he owes money, but what is the process before the IRS decides he owes money?<\/turn>\n<turn>Ephraim McDowell: Sure. So there's initially an information-gathering process where there could be audits and examinations that -- it's a long process.

Then, once that process concludes, the IRS will make a liability determination, meaning this person is liable for some amount of taxes owed.

I mean, there's a family of offenses. I didn't think it was that complicated, but I don't know what you think that the definition of process of law was.<\/turn>\n<turn>Curtis E. Gannon: Well, I -- I -- we do think that all of those are going to come in. We think that the fact that those are all, you know, different acts demonstrates why this is a family of offenses, and -- but we -- but they are temporal points --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: So killing the judge during the case is -- is the same as killing the judge after the case?<\/turn>\n<turn>Curtis E. Gannon: Yes. Or --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: They're both obstruction?<\/turn>\n<turn>Curtis E. Gannon: And also, you know, preventing a witness from showing up during the trial is the same as preventing a witness from reporting a crime to the police in the first instance.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Okay.<\/turn>\n<turn>Curtis E. Gannon: And, indeed, in California, as we point out, they punish the preventing the report of the crime even more harshly than preventing a witness from testifying at trial.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Okay. A slightly different tack. \"Relating to,\" I think there is ambiguity about what that means, and I wouldn't want it to just stretch forever, like some of my colleagues said. But, to the extent there's ambiguity about whether it's the core 1503 or includes before and after, I would think \"relating to\" is -- is a helpful textual indicator there.<\/turn>\n<turn>Curtis E. Gannon: I -- I agree with that. And I -- I would also agree with Justice Jackson. If you took this as a family of offenses and this relates to the entire family of offenses, that would -- that would capture the bulk of what we're concerned about here.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Okay. And then last question, again, on a different tack. The immigrant in these cases is still eligible -- correct me if I'm wrong -- for statutory withholding of removal and for CAT, Convention Against Torture, as well. Is that accurate? I saw that in a footnote.<\/turn>\n<turn>Curtis E. Gannon: That's -- that's in Footnote 3 on page 3 of our brief.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Accurate footnote?<\/turn>\n<turn>Curtis E. Gannon: I sure hope so.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Okay. Thank you.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Barrett?<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Mr. Gannon, in your interchange with Justice Jackson, she was asking you about Chapter 73. I just wanted to clarify. That is a title that was put in by the codifiers, not Congress, correct?<\/turn>\n<turn>Curtis E. Gannon: To the extent that Congress codified Title 18 as positive law in 1948, then Congress adopted it, but they did so along with a provision that said: Don't consider where this particular offense is classified when you're construing this offense for purposes of -- of construing Title 18. And so --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Right.<\/turn>\n<turn>Curtis E. Gannon: -- the answer to your question is -- is \"yes, but.\"<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Well, but we've --<\/turn>\n<turn>Curtis E. Gannon: It ends up in the same place.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: -- said you can't put too much weight on that --<\/turn>\n<turn>Curtis E. Gannon: That --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: -- the fact that it appears under Chapter 73, the title \"obstruction of justice.\" I'm just wondering how far you would take that. Do you -- are there any offenses in Chapter 73 that you think wouldn't qualify, or is the fact that they fall under the title \"obstruction of justice\" as organized by the codifiers enough?<\/turn>\n<turn>Curtis E. Gannon: If they don't have the specific intent, then I don't think that they would qualify. The 1520 offense about keeping audit papers may or may not include that specific intent. I'm not sure. The civil --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Well, there's one about a sound truck outside of a courthouse too.<\/turn>\n<turn>Curtis E. Gannon: -- the -- the -- the civil actions in, you know, 1514 and 1514A aren't criminal offenses. So something can be there without being an obstruction-of-justice offense. But we -- we -- we think that the fact that Congress put them all together is evidence consistent with a common meaning and a common understanding and what we think the term means --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Okay. Thank you.<\/turn>\n<turn>Curtis E. Gannon: -- without making the title dispositive.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Jackson?<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: Yes. So I think that was helpful because, what is your view? Your view is that in order to be in the family of offenses, you have to do what? I'm sorry.<\/turn>\n<turn>Curtis E. Gannon: You -- you have to take some affirmative act --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: Okay.<\/turn>\n<turn>Curtis E. Gannon: -- with a specific intent --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: Okay.<\/turn>\n<turn>Curtis E.

So, if there is actually a good argument that there is a legal error, however the Petitioner is -- is writing about it, then, yes, that legal error is reviewable. What is not reviewable is the sort of claim that we have in this case, where the -- the agency articulates the correct interpretation of the statute that the Board has already given it and then it explains all of the evidence, it explains the factual conclusions it's made, it explains its discretionary judgment, so it explains the predictive and comparative analysis --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: I -- I think what you're -- what you're doing, Ms. Sinzdak, is just basically, you know, trying to get away from the question, because, of course, there are all kinds of reasonable things that immigration judges do every day, and they mostly do them -- you know, it's like, you know, lots of facts and it's a hard question and it's a lot of judgment, and then, when we decide something, then, of course, a judge is going to leave it alone because it seems pretty reasonable.

Kennedy: Why?<\/turn>\n<turn>Christopher Landau: Because this is, again, the lesson of Wheeler. It was uncontested in Wheeler that plenary congressional control over the Indians -- over the Indian tribes meant that Congress could abrogate Indian sovereign immunity with the stroke of a pen, and even abrogate the tribes and derecognize the tribes. But that didn't mean that the existing tribal laws at the time were not considered the laws of the separate tribes --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M.

Are you suggesting there's kind of a second class sovereignty and a first class sovereignty?<\/turn>\n<turn>Christopher Landau: Well, Your Honor, I -- I couldn't agree more with your insight, that \"sovereignty\" is a slippery word. If you got 12 political philosophers, they would all give you a different answer as to what \"sovereignty\" means. And I think that is precisely why Wheeler said we can't have judges and courts trying to decide double jeopardy questions by asking abstract questions of sovereignty, because, you know, even the State sovereignty is different than the sovereignty of the independent nations. They don't have ambassadors, et cetera. So what this Court has made clear is that the test in the double jeopardy context is all about the source of authority for the laws. And going back to Justice Kagan's question, which I think cuts to the heart of the case, in this particular case Congress said, we -- and this is pursuant to demands for -- by the people of Puerto Rico for government by consent. The people of Puerto Rico said, we are tired of being a colony. We want to create our own government. And so the Constitution of Puerto Rico could not be more explicit on this score, that it says, \"The political power of the Commonwealth emanates from the people.\" That document was submitted to the Puerto Rico voters. So you're a Puerto Rico voter and you say this is what I'm voting for. It was submitted to the President of the United States and Congress, who approved that particular --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Mr. Landau, we have a situation as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. I think it was two of the justices who said we're not going to get into this business about the Constitution. We think, interpreting our own double jeopardy provision, somebody should not be tried a second time. So that's going to be the law of Puerto Rico. That's -- if the Puerto Rico Supreme Court said that, then we would have the situation that led us to grant cert in this case. That is, if you have a prosecution first in the Federal government, then Puerto Rico will not have a second prosecution. You have it first in Puerto Rico. The Federal government is free to institute a second prosecution.<\/turn>\n<turn>Christopher Landau: You're absolutely -- you're absolutely right, Your Honor. And that was the position of two of the nine justices on the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. That position did not command a majority, which is why there's no adequate and independent State ground here. The majority was very explicit --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But they could. They could. If -- if the -- if we told the majority you're wrong, nothing would prevent them from agreeing with those two justices, right?<\/turn>\n<turn>Christopher Landau: No, that's absolutely right. And -- and about 21 --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Then there's no way you could break that situation of having -- it depends on which -- which jurisdiction goes first.<\/turn>\n<turn>Christopher Landau: That's correct, Your Honor. And that -- that is true in about 21 states, that as a matter of State law, either statutory or constitutional, do not allow a subsequent prosecution. But again, that doesn't change the point. What -- what made a cert grant appropriate and intolerable was that the Federal -- was the difference between the Federal and State courts in Puerto Rico on the Federal constitutional question.

They can't print money. They can't do lots of things that others would consider them sovereign for. So I guess the Constitution does something else with that word.

So is it because they are not foreseeable or is it because they are not measurable?<\/turn>\n<turn>Robert S. Peck: I think they are difficult to measure.

We think that what we've done is propose an approach --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: The statute doesn't prohibit decreasing property tax values.<\/turn>\n<turn>Robert S. Peck: But it does prohibit -- it prohibits discrimination in housing, and this is one of the damages that we suffer that is directly from -- the result of these kinds of home loans. So therefore, we've -- we've tried to cabin our damages with respect to these specific properties and -- and we -- damages that they generate directly to the City. You know, all proximate cause requires is a sufficient connection between the alleged misconduct and the result, and it includes any injury the statute seeks to protect against. So here we have injuries that the statute seeks to protect against. My friend doesn't disagree that those injuries are protected by the statute, and, certainly, in Gladstone and Havens, those injuries are the injuries that this -- this Court recognized. So the question then becomes what's appropriate damages? We think we have proposed damages that are tightly connected to the actual injury that the City has suffered.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: Do we have to go into that, or not? I'm not -- not saying we should or shouldn't, but I mean, do we have to to decide this case, decide the damages, what damages are appropriate?<\/turn>\n<turn>Robert S. Peck: You do not need to decide that. In fact, one of the things that the Eleventh Circuit noted is that in the time between when the briefs were written and when we argued the case, this Court came down with the decision in Inclusive Communities, and in that decision, the Court's mentioned that there is a proximate-cause pleading standard that needs to be incorporated.

But instead what we found, and what the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged, is that while the kinds of loans -- the financial crisis was set off by subprime lending. But the kinds of loans that are being offered here have taken different forms, but the underlying practice remains the same, that minority borrowers are getting more expensive and riskier loans that are quicker to foreclosure, and -- and that foreclosure may be as many, for some minorities, seven times as frequently as the non-minority borrowers.<\/turn>\n<\/context>\n<justice>Justice John G.

So, if you have any comments about that, about his argument or about that particular aspect of it, I'd like to hear them.<\/turn>\n<turn>Ian H.

And I think this is one of the most straightforward statutory construction cases this Court will see. The Major Crimes Act at statehood provided that it applied to any state of the United States. There is no exception for Oklahoma, and there was none before, at, or after statehood. Second, what they have pointed to, what the other side has pointed to, is what happened before statehood, and what happened before statehood was that crimes were being prosecuted in the name of the United States in courts set up by Congress, applying federal law, which the -- which had adopted Arkansas law as the rule of decision. It is the exact opposite of conferring jurisdiction on the states to try. Third, there was nothing in the Enabling Act that would have changed that. Indeed, the Enabling Act sent to federal courts all cases which, had they been committed in a state, would have been subject to federal prosecution. That describes the Major Crimes Act perfectly. And finally, Your Honor, when Congress transfers jurisdiction to a state, it does so expressly. In Nagonset, which this Court described as the first major transfer of jurisdiction, the language used was jurisdiction is conferred. In Public Law 280, the states shall have jurisdiction. In New York, New York shall have jurisdiction. And even in -- with respect to Oklahoma, in 1908, when they transferred -- when Congress transferred probate jurisdiction, it said the -- that the Oklahoma courts shall have jurisdiction. And so tribal --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Thank you, counsel. Justice Alito?<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: You referred to the Oklahoma Enabling Act, but the language in that is that a case would be -- a case that was pending in the territorial court at the time of statehood would be sent to one of the new federal district courts or to one of the new state courts depending on where it would have been prosecuted if it had been prosecuted in a state. It doesn't say in a state in Indian Country. It says in a state. So isn't the clear meaning of that that cases in Oklahoma would be treated like cases anyplace else?<\/turn>\n<turn>Ian H. Gershengorn: So, Your Honor, I don't -- they -- treated like anyplace else, meaning it was subject to the Major Crimes Act. So I do -- I agree with you that there is no Oklahoma exceptionalism, but I think that cuts exactly in our favor.

There is no exception for Oklahoma, and there was none before, at, or after statehood. Second, what they have pointed to, what the other side has pointed to, is what happened before statehood, and what happened before statehood was that crimes were being prosecuted in the name of the United States in courts set up by Congress, applying federal law, which the -- which had adopted Arkansas law as the rule of decision. It is the exact opposite of conferring jurisdiction on the states to try. Third, there was nothing in the Enabling Act that would have changed that. Indeed, the Enabling Act sent to federal courts all cases which, had they been committed in a state, would have been subject to federal prosecution. That describes the Major Crimes Act perfectly. And finally, Your Honor, when Congress transfers jurisdiction to a state, it does so expressly. In Nagonset, which this Court described as the first major transfer of jurisdiction, the language used was jurisdiction is conferred. In Public Law 280, the states shall have jurisdiction. In New York, New York shall have jurisdiction. And even in -- with respect to Oklahoma, in 1908, when they transferred -- when Congress transferred probate jurisdiction, it said the -- that the Oklahoma courts shall have jurisdiction. And so tribal --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Thank you, counsel. Justice Alito?<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: You referred to the Oklahoma Enabling Act, but the language in that is that a case would be -- a case that was pending in the territorial court at the time of statehood would be sent to one of the new federal district courts or to one of the new state courts depending on where it would have been prosecuted if it had been prosecuted in a state. It doesn't say in a state in Indian Country. It says in a state. So isn't the clear meaning of that that cases in Oklahoma would be treated like cases anyplace else?<\/turn>\n<turn>Ian H. Gershengorn: So, Your Honor, I don't -- they -- treated like anyplace else, meaning it was subject to the Major Crimes Act. So I do -- I agree with you that there is no Oklahoma exceptionalism, but I think that cuts exactly in our favor. What Oklahoma is saying is that, uniquely among all the states in the union, it's exempt from the Major Crimes Act. I think the Enabling Act, the language Your Honor is citing, does exactly the opposite.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: How about --<\/turn>\n<turn>Ian H.

That's why we don't just assume preemption willy-nilly, and there are rules that make clear that preemption applies when certain clear statements are made. Now I agree Garmon goes further, but it still respects the fact that state courts have an overriding interest in adjudicating state tort claims. The second stake is the plaintiff's right to petition the courts. You know, frankly, we'd prefer not to be before an administrative agency where the agency is the judge, jury, and executioner. We prefer to be in a court system where we have a -- a -- a neutral judge and the potential for a jury.

But, to go back then to Justice Sotomayor's question, if the Board now has done an investigation into this matter and has a different view of the facts than -- than your client has, what is the relevance of that in the state court proceeding? I would think, as Justice Sotomayor was suggesting, that that's where -- well, it -- it becomes appropriate to say no, now, you know, something has changed.<\/turn>\n<turn>Noel J. Francisco: And, again -- so I -- I -- I have two responses. The first is that that's completely contrary to Bill Johnson's because that's the exact situation --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Okay. Put -- put the Bill Johnson's --<\/turn>\n<turn>Noel J. Francisco: -- of Bill Johnson's.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: -- aside.<\/turn>\n<turn>Noel J. Francisco: Secondly, what I would say is that the state court can certainly hand over those facts to the union and those facts can be introduced in the state court proceeding, and if based on those facts it becomes clear at summary judgment or a later stage that there's arguable protection or actual protection, then you grant the preemption defense, unless, of course, the local interest exception applies, but you proceed in the ordinary course the way you do in every other or almost every other federal preemption case.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Gorsuch?<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: What's at stake in allowing state courts to proceed in the ordinary course as -- as you're talking about?<\/turn>\n<turn>Noel J. Francisco: The -- the stake is that you preserve, one, the state's traditional authority to adjudicate tort claims. Preemption is -- is a big deal. That's why we don't just assume preemption willy-nilly, and there are rules that make clear that preemption applies when certain clear statements are made. Now I agree Garmon goes further, but it still respects the fact that state courts have an overriding interest in adjudicating state tort claims. The second stake is the plaintiff's right to petition the courts. You know, frankly, we'd prefer not to be before an administrative agency where the agency is the judge, jury, and executioner. We prefer to be in a court system where we have a -- a -- a neutral judge and the potential for a jury. And so that's why it also protects, as Bill Johnson's also made clear, the plaintiff's right to petition the courts for redress.<\/turn>\n<\/context>\n<justice>Justice Neil Gorsuch<\/justice>\nGenerate a question that Justice Neil Gorsuch is likely to ask next.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nHere's a potential next question from Justice Neil Gorsuch:\n\n\"Counsel, you've emphasized the importance of preserving the state's traditional authority to adjudicate tort claims and the plaintiff's right to petition the courts.

And we were a little bit loose back then in terms of our textual approach to things.<\/turn>\n<turn>John Hueston: Yes, Your Honor.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Justice Gorsuch's question, though, is a fair one because it's the practice of the Supreme Court with respect to filing of amicus briefs that we don't grant extensions but we take late amicus. And so why can't we look at the exact words of 26(b) and say, no, you can't extend the time, but a court has, as it always has, equitable discretion to take something that's filed late because, assuming that the facts qualify as equitable, and that's open to question, I know, in this case, but assuming, why don't we read the provision as it states, a court can permit an act to be done after that time expires?<\/turn>\n<turn>John Hueston: Justice Sotomayor, let me address -- there were several parts to your question. Let me try to address each in turn. Undoubtedly, and as this Court has stated repeatedly in recent decisions, that there was a sort of loose use of the term \"jurisdictional.\" However, and, in fact, that loose use of the word \"jurisdictional\" was, in fact, improperly used in the Robinson case. And that has been pointed out. But the Court in more recent decisions, particularly the Kontrick decision and the Eberhart decision, specifically cites Robinson as still good law, acknowledging, though, the term \"jurisdictional\" was misused, that, in fact, Robinson stands for, as Eberhart said, observing clear limits of the rules. So going back to the second part of your question, the Robinson case specifically addressed the issue that, well, if the Court has not addressed that second portion, an act that could be allowed, if we allowed a late filing, that would, in fact, eviscerate the first proscription and render, in fact, that portion of Rule 26(b) a nullity.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: So what work does that language then do to permit an act to be done after the deadline?<\/turn>\n<turn>John Hueston: And I --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Why doesn't your interpretation itself render that language a nullity?<\/turn>\n<turn>John Hueston: And, Justice Gorsuch, I've been giving thought to that.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: I had hoped you might.

So I would have thought that it would have had to do something about time. And I'm just struggling to come up with an example of what work that language does under your interpretation.<\/turn>\n<turn>John Hueston: Your Honor, it might, for instance, countenance some other related proceeding or action, other than an extension of time on the actual motion for petition for permission to appeal that would be filed. That might be an instance where that would apply. But I --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: I'm sorry, you'll need to explain that to me because I'm not following you.<\/turn>\n<turn>John Hueston: Your Honor, I think the language in 26(b) as construed by Robinson in this instance would preclude an enlargement of the time to file. But what another act that might be allowed could be an act that relates to another motion that might be filed in the proceeding or something collateral but not the actual motion itself. If, in fact, we read it to include the motion itself, the Court, and, of court -- course, the Court can revisit the thinking in Robinson, the Court would be moving right into the facts of Robinson and writing out the prescription on the extension of time.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: The problem is that we really wouldn't -- yes, you're right, we would be revisiting Robinson, but we would be saying that the words of a statute have meaning, and Robinson read out of that permission the equitable considerations that the very statute permitted.<\/turn>\n<turn>John Hueston: Your Honor, this case is actually a stronger case with more emphatic language considered collectively than Robinson and Carlisle because we not only have the equivalent of Rule 45(b) and 26(b), we also have Appellate Rule 2, where there is, of course, the notion of equity and suspending the rules.

[Laughter] I would vastly prefer, Mr. Chief Justice, that the Court hold that it is constitutional. And I think that it should, because -- let me outline--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Well, just -- just so we -- we know what is -- what is going on here: It is not the case that the Petitioner here has said here that if we adopt his interpretation, it will render the statute constitutional. He doesn't say that. He says that if we adopt his interpretation, we can avoid reaching the constitutional question, because whether it's constitutional or not, it at least requires the -- the kind of financial harm that -- that he asserts. So he is not asserting that if we -- if we accept his position, the statute is constitutional. I don't read his brief as saying that, anyway.<\/turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: --That's probably a fair characterization of language in his brief, but it does bear note that he never asked this Court to decide that question. Now, the question that is before the Court, and I think it will illuminate the vagueness concerns that are on the Justice's minds, is: What does the statute mean? And the way to understand this statute is to recognize that when this Court held in McNally that the mail fraud statute did not protect intangible rights, Congress came back in response to this Court's invitation and said: Yes, it does; it protects the intangible right of honest services which had assumed the status of a term of art in--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: How could it have been a term of art when the courts -- the lower courts were massively confused?<\/turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: --Justice Ginsburg, I think the description of the lower courts as massively confused is not correct. It's not a fair description of the cases.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Well, there wasn't even a uniform terminology in the lower courts. They didn't all use--<\/turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: All of the lower courts used essential synonyms for what Congress sought to reinstate. They refer to the right of honest services, faithful and honest services, loyal and honest services, and they were talking about one thing: Divided loyalties of an agent or a fiduciary.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: Now, as I hear that -- I am exaggerating, possibly, but I think every agent has a duty of loyalty to provide loyal and honest services to the master, master agent. Every worker is an agent of his master, the employer. So every instance in which a worker does not provide honest services to the employer, he has met your test. I think there are 300 -- perhaps there are 150 million workers in the United States. I think possibly 140 of them would flunk your test. [Laughter] I mean, that's what worrying me. Now, why? Because -- I -- \"Do you like my hat\"? Says the boss. \"Oh, I love your hat. \" says the worker. Why? So the boss will leave the room so that the worker can continue to read the racing form. Deception? Designed to work at reading the racing form instead of doing your honest work and, therefore, violation? Now, explain to me how your test does not -- and I think you can probably do it; I just don't understand it at the moment. Explain it to me, how your test does not make this statute potentially criminalizing 100 million workers in the United States, or some tens of millions?<\/turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: Justice Breyer, I hope you give me a moment to explain my theory of the statute in response to your question.

And I think that it should, because -- let me outline--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Well, just -- just so we -- we know what is -- what is going on here: It is not the case that the Petitioner here has said here that if we adopt his interpretation, it will render the statute constitutional. He doesn't say that. He says that if we adopt his interpretation, we can avoid reaching the constitutional question, because whether it's constitutional or not, it at least requires the -- the kind of financial harm that -- that he asserts. So he is not asserting that if we -- if we accept his position, the statute is constitutional. I don't read his brief as saying that, anyway.<\/turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: --That's probably a fair characterization of language in his brief, but it does bear note that he never asked this Court to decide that question. Now, the question that is before the Court, and I think it will illuminate the vagueness concerns that are on the Justice's minds, is: What does the statute mean? And the way to understand this statute is to recognize that when this Court held in McNally that the mail fraud statute did not protect intangible rights, Congress came back in response to this Court's invitation and said: Yes, it does; it protects the intangible right of honest services which had assumed the status of a term of art in--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: How could it have been a term of art when the courts -- the lower courts were massively confused?<\/turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: --Justice Ginsburg, I think the description of the lower courts as massively confused is not correct. It's not a fair description of the cases.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Well, there wasn't even a uniform terminology in the lower courts. They didn't all use--<\/turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: All of the lower courts used essential synonyms for what Congress sought to reinstate. They refer to the right of honest services, faithful and honest services, loyal and honest services, and they were talking about one thing: Divided loyalties of an agent or a fiduciary.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: Now, as I hear that -- I am exaggerating, possibly, but I think every agent has a duty of loyalty to provide loyal and honest services to the master, master agent. Every worker is an agent of his master, the employer. So every instance in which a worker does not provide honest services to the employer, he has met your test. I think there are 300 -- perhaps there are 150 million workers in the United States. I think possibly 140 of them would flunk your test. [Laughter] I mean, that's what worrying me. Now, why? Because -- I -- \"Do you like my hat\"? Says the boss. \"Oh, I love your hat. \" says the worker. Why? So the boss will leave the room so that the worker can continue to read the racing form. Deception? Designed to work at reading the racing form instead of doing your honest work and, therefore, violation? Now, explain to me how your test does not -- and I think you can probably do it; I just don't understand it at the moment. Explain it to me, how your test does not make this statute potentially criminalizing 100 million workers in the United States, or some tens of millions?<\/turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: Justice Breyer, I hope you give me a moment to explain my theory of the statute in response to your question. The statute covers bribes, kickbacks, and undisclosed conflicts of interest by an agent or fiduciary who takes action to further that interest. These were well-recognized categories of honest services violations. Virtually every circuit that examined the pre-McNally case law said these are the prototypical cases.

Congress could always channel suits into state court. That's the Madisonian compromise that -- that this Court has recognized for -- for many years, and the fact that the Court -- the Congress decided to do that in this case I don't think changes the Plan of the Convention surrender analysis. As to your second question about damages, I agree that the damages at issue here are different than in a takings case, but they're not different than would be at issue in a Title VII case under the Fourteenth Amendment, where I think everybody agrees, including my friends from Texas, that they're suable, including in state court, for damages in a -- in a discrimination case that would look a lot like the suit in this case, although the basis for the discrimination obviously would be different. It -- it -- there's nothing for and about the notion of damages and -- and a waiver of state sovereign immunity and the same is true about suits by states against other states.

As I said earlier, both are granted and withheld by the text of the Constitution, and I think both indicate an unusual and particularly sort of superior relationship between the federal government and the states. Obviously, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted as a result of war, and the understanding of the -- of the Raise and Support Armies Clause was similar -- similarly a response to the Revolutionary War and the failure of the states to provide for the military and, you know, the paramount purpose of ensuring that state obstruction of the federal military would not continue under the new Constitution.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Clarence Thomas: Thank you.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

And you're giving us a very broad view of what those powers are, including to raise Armies, going so far as to suits against the states for veterans coming home, and without any linkage to necessity of any current exigency or any need for troops today. There's no argument here, as I understand it, that this is actually necessary or that Congress couldn't and the federal government couldn't bring these suits themselves if they wanted to do so. There's no argument that this is necessary -- allowing private suits against states is necessary to raise an Army in the United States today. And so I guess I'm just wondering, what are the limits? I mean, Justice -- Justice Alito posited a pretty interesting example about potholes on interstate highways. Would every state policy that could be subject to an argument that it would impair the ability of the federal government to raise an Army or a Navy or to conduct war be subject to suit, private suit, by private individuals with punitive damages and attorneys' fees?

As I said earlier, both are granted and withheld by the text of the Constitution, and I think both indicate an unusual and particularly sort of superior relationship between the federal government and the states. Obviously, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted as a result of war, and the understanding of the -- of the Raise and Support Armies Clause was similar -- similarly a response to the Revolutionary War and the failure of the states to provide for the military and, you know, the paramount purpose of ensuring that state obstruction of the federal military would not continue under the new Constitution.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Clarence Thomas: Thank you.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

Petitioner's contrary contention is incompatible with the FAA, this Court's authority, the agreement's plain language, and simple common sense. We submit that the Court should affirm for two independent reasons. First, the mere incorporation of the AAA rules is not clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.

It does not utter one syllable about it. Anyone actually aware of this arcane issue would address the subject expressly on the face of the agreement. And that is especially so against the backdrop of this Court's heightened standard and how easy it is to address the question directly. It is simply not plausible that anyone would recognize this issue and choose to resolve it by relying on an oblique reference to the AAA rules rather than a simple, explicit sentence delegating the gateway issue. Second, even if there is a delegation clause, it does not reach this dispute.

If an action falls within the carveout, then it is not subject to arbitration and it is not subject to arbitration under the AAA rules.

Roberts, Jr.: We will hear argument first this morning in Case 132 on our original docket, Alabama v. North Carolina. Mr. Phillips.<\/turn>\n<turn>Carter G. Phillips: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: North Carolina breached the Southeast Compact in this case. Whether you examine it from the perspective of the sanctions that were imposed by the Commission, or whether you evaluate it from the perspective of the repeated statements by the executives of the Commission that there had been a material breach and a repudiation, or whether you examine it from the perspective of the undisputed record that was collected by the Special Master, the conclusion, it seems to me, is inescapable that what North Carolina did here by taking no action between December 1997 and July of 1996 simply does not fulfill the responsibilities that they had -- that North Carolina had assumed, and therefore the only issue should be: What is the appropriate remedy for this extraordinary breach? To go to the specific record, just to be clear about this, the Special Master says at page 10 of his report: \"The parties do not dispute that North Carolina did not take additional steps to pursue a license for a waste facility during that period. \" Our undisputed statement of facts is that North Carolina took no further steps to license between 1997 and 1999.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Mr. Phillips, the point that North Carolina makes is it would be throwing away the taxpayers' money to no purpose. That is, what is the point of continuing to pursue a license when North Carolina does not have the funding to continue the process and to open the disposal facility? So North Carolina's point of view is: What does it mean to continue to seek the license when they are not going to have the money to get to the end of the line?<\/turn>\n<turn>Carter G. Phillips: Right. Well, North Carolina assumed the responsibility more than a decade prior to that time to take all appropriate steps in order to provide for licensing and for construction of a facility. \"Appropriate steps\" in that context has to mean something more than simply doing nothing, declaring categorically that you are going to repudiate the agreement, and attempting to extort from the compact and its Commission additional monies that it is absolutely clear that the Commission has no responsibility to North Carolina to pay.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But the--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: But how much -- how much did the Commission give before this?

Phillips: --The language of the -- of the compact itself, Justice Scalia, is quite plain. It's clear that the Commission has no responsibility to create -- to pay for the creation of this -- of this facility. That was clear from day one.

Roberts, Jr.: We will hear argument first this morning in Case 132 on our original docket, Alabama v. North Carolina. Mr. Phillips.<\/turn>\n<turn>Carter G. Phillips: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: North Carolina breached the Southeast Compact in this case. Whether you examine it from the perspective of the sanctions that were imposed by the Commission, or whether you evaluate it from the perspective of the repeated statements by the executives of the Commission that there had been a material breach and a repudiation, or whether you examine it from the perspective of the undisputed record that was collected by the Special Master, the conclusion, it seems to me, is inescapable that what North Carolina did here by taking no action between December 1997 and July of 1996 simply does not fulfill the responsibilities that they had -- that North Carolina had assumed, and therefore the only issue should be: What is the appropriate remedy for this extraordinary breach? To go to the specific record, just to be clear about this, the Special Master says at page 10 of his report: \"The parties do not dispute that North Carolina did not take additional steps to pursue a license for a waste facility during that period. \" Our undisputed statement of facts is that North Carolina took no further steps to license between 1997 and 1999.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Mr. Phillips, the point that North Carolina makes is it would be throwing away the taxpayers' money to no purpose. That is, what is the point of continuing to pursue a license when North Carolina does not have the funding to continue the process and to open the disposal facility? So North Carolina's point of view is: What does it mean to continue to seek the license when they are not going to have the money to get to the end of the line?<\/turn>\n<turn>Carter G. Phillips: Right. Well, North Carolina assumed the responsibility more than a decade prior to that time to take all appropriate steps in order to provide for licensing and for construction of a facility. \"Appropriate steps\" in that context has to mean something more than simply doing nothing, declaring categorically that you are going to repudiate the agreement, and attempting to extort from the compact and its Commission additional monies that it is absolutely clear that the Commission has no responsibility to North Carolina to pay.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But the--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: But how much -- how much did the Commission give before this? It just did that out of the goodness of its heart?<\/turn>\n<turn>Carter G. Phillips: No, it did it with -- with the approval of the other States in the compact, for the purpose of promoting the ultimate objective of the -- of the contract--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: And -- and I think that one of the best indications of what -- what a contract means is the manner in which the parties act under the contract, and that suggests to me that it was never contemplated that North Carolina alone would foot the bill for -- for obtaining this license.<\/turn>\n<turn>Carter G. Phillips: --The language of the -- of the compact itself, Justice Scalia, is quite plain. It's clear that the Commission has no responsibility to create -- to pay for the creation of this -- of this facility. That was clear from day one. North Carolina, not only in its legislation authorizing its authority, but also its governor repeatedly saying, we understand that we have a responsibility to create this facility, that--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: At what cost?<\/turn>\n<turn>Carter G. Phillips: --At whatever cost--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: What the Special Master said was, I believe, that there was never an obligation to do it at all costs. They didn't have to bankrupt their treasury to do this; is that correct?<\/turn>\n<turn>Carter G. Phillips: --Well--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Do you accept that as a working proposition?<\/turn>\n<turn>Carter G.

I was just looking at the case. It doesn't say that. In fact, they analyze prejudice.<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: That's right. The -- the Court has only presumed prejudice, that I'm aware of, in one case, Doggett, and --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: Have we held that?<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: You held that -- there -- two -- two things: Extraordinary delay. It was an eight and a half-year delay between when a person was indicted and when they were brought to trial. And then it was -- there -- the Court said there was no justifiable reason for that delay.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: No, no. My question is you heard your -- your brother counsel say that Barker v. Wingo, if it applied, would presume prejudice. So I've just been looking at that. And in the case itself it doesn't presume prejudice.<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: It does not.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: It analyzes whether there was or was not prejudice. So I want to know where that requirement of presumed prejudice comes from.<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: The first -- the first factor in Barker is to -- to analyze what --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: I know the four factors. I have them in front of me.<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: Yes. That's the presumptive prejudice factor gets you -- gets you to the test. So it triggers the test. I think my friend is referring to the Doggett case, though. That's -- and in his brief, he cites Doggett as -- as sort of this, at some point, if the delay is so excessive -- and I -- I take it that he's not arguing --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: All right. So -- so it -- I mean, obviously, it's a 20-year delay. The person won't even remember who he was going to call, and all the witnesses will be gone and so forth. So I think it's fair to say there was prejudice in such a case, if that's what it's about. So if it isn't presumed all the time, do you have any objection, as he apparently does not have any objection, to our saying you're right. It's the Due Process Clause. Now, in applying the Due Process Clause to cases where the sentencing has been unduly delayed or that is the claim, you -- the Court should apply the factors as set out in Barker v. Wingo.<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: And there's a couple problems with that. One, Barker was specifically designed to take into account pretrial interests under the Speedy Trial Clause. And in the case that Justice Kagan mentioned, the forfeiture case, that was a pre-adjudication case, so it fit in that context. So applying Barker, courts have done it, applied it --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Sorry, that was a forfeiture case.<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: Correct.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: And that's a penalty after adjudication. The forfeiture doesn't start until someone has been found --<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: I think it was a -- I'm sorry, it was a pre -- basically, property was taken before --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: Whatever the case is, I'd like to get an answer to my question.<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: Sure.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: It says the Court should balance four factors: Length of delay, the reason for delay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant. Now, if I quote that sentence and say those are the factors that should be taken into account under the Due Process Clause, do you have any objection to that?<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: Prejudice needs to take the forefront in that analysis.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: I should just reverse the four?<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: Well, the problem with Barker is it held -- it holds that -- I mean, in the postconviction setting is that none of the factors are necessary. So prejudice doesn't necessarily have to be shown in Barker. Lower courts have modified that and said in the postconviction setting, a defendant has to show prejudice. In the -- the test that lower courts use, the modified Barker test looks a lot like Lovasco. In fact, it say it's indistinguishable because prejudice. And prejudice is the key, to the answer to your question, Justice Breyer, that in a postconviction setting, that's what's necessary. And also, to my friend's point that the Petitioner made claims of prejudice, I'd point the Court to Joint Appendix 66 and 68 where he -- he made his claim of prejudice in -- in the space of a couple paragraphs. And this sort of illustrates the problem the State has in rebutting claims of prejudice that aren't substantiated. He didn't file his -- his affidavit, which was still fairly bare, but at least more substantiated, until three months after he filed his motion, and the motion was denied, his motion to reconsider.

It was an eight and a half-year delay between when a person was indicted and when they were brought to trial. And then it was -- there -- the Court said there was no justifiable reason for that delay.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: No, no. My question is you heard your -- your brother counsel say that Barker v. Wingo, if it applied, would presume prejudice. So I've just been looking at that. And in the case itself it doesn't presume prejudice.<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: It does not.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: It analyzes whether there was or was not prejudice. So I want to know where that requirement of presumed prejudice comes from.<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: The first -- the first factor in Barker is to -- to analyze what --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: I know the four factors. I have them in front of me.<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: Yes. That's the presumptive prejudice factor gets you -- gets you to the test. So it triggers the test. I think my friend is referring to the Doggett case, though. That's -- and in his brief, he cites Doggett as -- as sort of this, at some point, if the delay is so excessive -- and I -- I take it that he's not arguing --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: All right. So -- so it -- I mean, obviously, it's a 20-year delay. The person won't even remember who he was going to call, and all the witnesses will be gone and so forth. So I think it's fair to say there was prejudice in such a case, if that's what it's about. So if it isn't presumed all the time, do you have any objection, as he apparently does not have any objection, to our saying you're right. It's the Due Process Clause. Now, in applying the Due Process Clause to cases where the sentencing has been unduly delayed or that is the claim, you -- the Court should apply the factors as set out in Barker v. Wingo.<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: And there's a couple problems with that. One, Barker was specifically designed to take into account pretrial interests under the Speedy Trial Clause. And in the case that Justice Kagan mentioned, the forfeiture case, that was a pre-adjudication case, so it fit in that context. So applying Barker, courts have done it, applied it --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Sorry, that was a forfeiture case.<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: Correct.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: And that's a penalty after adjudication. The forfeiture doesn't start until someone has been found --<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: I think it was a -- I'm sorry, it was a pre -- basically, property was taken before --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: Whatever the case is, I'd like to get an answer to my question.<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: Sure.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: It says the Court should balance four factors: Length of delay, the reason for delay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant. Now, if I quote that sentence and say those are the factors that should be taken into account under the Due Process Clause, do you have any objection to that?<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: Prejudice needs to take the forefront in that analysis.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: I should just reverse the four?<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: Well, the problem with Barker is it held -- it holds that -- I mean, in the postconviction setting is that none of the factors are necessary. So prejudice doesn't necessarily have to be shown in Barker. Lower courts have modified that and said in the postconviction setting, a defendant has to show prejudice. In the -- the test that lower courts use, the modified Barker test looks a lot like Lovasco. In fact, it say it's indistinguishable because prejudice. And prejudice is the key, to the answer to your question, Justice Breyer, that in a postconviction setting, that's what's necessary. And also, to my friend's point that the Petitioner made claims of prejudice, I'd point the Court to Joint Appendix 66 and 68 where he -- he made his claim of prejudice in -- in the space of a couple paragraphs. And this sort of illustrates the problem the State has in rebutting claims of prejudice that aren't substantiated. He didn't file his -- his affidavit, which was still fairly bare, but at least more substantiated, until three months after he filed his motion, and the motion was denied, his motion to reconsider.

Usually we don't think of appellate courts as the courts that are going to be engaging in fact finding in the first instance. Of course, I recognize, as Justice Sotomayor was pointing out, that there are  --there are instances in which that happens, but I think the general rule is that we don't normally see that. I would also think that, you know, the fact that some amount of process has already been undertaken and that the  --the claims have been  --that have started to be reviewed and there has been a certain amount of  -- of that process that has already gone into effect would -- would indicate that Congress perhaps wants or -- or would be less concerned with imposing kind of harsh consequences because you're already within kind of the review scheme, whereas it might then also choose to privilege the idea or the  -- the -- the fact that it wants to ensure efficient administration and resolution of the claims that have been brought and to privilege kind of the  -- the finality requirements that  -- or the finality interests that -- that arise in that context as well. I also think that this Court on its own has  -- has recognized that the same considerations apply to appeals from district courts and to appeals from agency decisions in its adoption of Rule 26. And I know that that is a separate argument that we've made here as well, but even setting the separate argument  aside, I think Rule 26, in -- in stating that the presumption is going to be that those deadlines for appeals either from Article III  district courts or from agency decisions are not subject to equitable tolling or are not able to be extended unless Congress specifically states that they are, indicates that this Court recognized in adopting that rule that the same kinds of considerations apply and would -- would -- would warrant that kind of rule in both instances. If I could speak directly to the history of this particular provision, I think that that provides even a further basis to -- to think that what Congress was doing here was requiring that this rule to be -- is jurisdictional. Prior to the creation of the Federal Circuit, review of  MSPB decisions came through the Court of Claims, where the time limit for filing is jurisdictional, as this Court recognized in John R. Sand, or it came through regional courts of appeals through the Hobbs  Act, where the time limits are jurisdictional under every circuit's precedent. So I think that it makes perfect sense that Congress would maintain the  jurisdictionality of the time limit when it was just shifting review of those matters over to the Federal Circuit. And the Federal Circuit, of course, then held that the deadline was jurisdictional very soon after it was created. Lindahl, I think, likewise, recognized the jurisdictional status of Section 7703(b)(1). And then, with that backdrop, Congress has reenacted and amended 7703(b)(1) numerous times, including with specific reference to the deadline. It changed the deadline from 30 days to 60 days. It changed when the time begins to run. So I think Congress really has been quite attentive to the way that the deadlines operate in this area and has never indicated that it disagrees with the jurisdictional status that it's -- that it's had. I think, you know, this Court has recognized that in Helsinn a few terms ago that when this Court adopts an interpretation of a  statute at least implicitly and the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over that statute and then makes explicit what was implicit in the Court's decision, that Congress  is then presumed to operate with that in the background and to  -- to know that and to, I guess, ratify that when it reenacts and readopts the same statutory language.<\/turn>\n<\/context>\n<justice>Justice John G.

It's not that it just causes various foreclosures all over the City; it's causing foreclosures in particular concentrated areas, and it's doing that because of racial segregation. And at the same time, it's preventing that racial segregation from ever being lifted because those communities are becoming more and more blighted and less and less capable of becoming integrated communities. So everything about this complaint is about racial segregation, it seems to me.<\/turn>\n<turn>Neal Kumar Katyal: Justice Kagan, I'd encourage you to just look back at what you just said and then read it against their complaint, because none of that's in the complaint.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: So do you think everything I just said, if their complaint was written like that, that they could maintain a suit?<\/turn>\n<turn>Neal Kumar Katyal: They could maintain a suit for segregation.

And with respect to zone of interest, I think that that complaint, the one that, Justice Kagan, you read, would satisfy zone of interest. It would allow at least a city to come in and get injunctive relief to try and preserve the kind of community-centered concepts that you're talking about. Now, the question is, would they be able to recover damages for that, including damages to the diminution of their tax base? It's certainly true, Justice Ginsburg, that Gladstone has that line at the end of page 110 which talks about diminution of tax revenues.

I think that -- that, if you're considering what is available at the sentencing, for whether it violates the constitution, would implicate the Eighth Amendment.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Well, let's put the Eighth Amendment to the side. Let's say that this isn't a capital case. All right?

And if not, why?<\/turn>\n<turn>Toby Crouse: Well, yes, I would accept that carving out strict liability in the corporate liability context.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Why? And how do you reconcile that with our strict liability cases?<\/turn>\n<turn>Toby Crouse: Well, I -- I think what this Court has done is historically guarded mens rea because that's what separates innocent conduct from criminal conduct. And that's what Kansas has done here.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: So you -- you accept that there is a constitutional minimum floor below which the state -- states cannot proceed with respect to mental capacity and insanity; you just suggest that you've met that standard.<\/turn>\n<turn>Toby Crouse: I --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Is that the -- the nub of the argument, then?<\/turn>\n<turn>Toby Crouse: I think I would finely parse that a little bit.

We did not know, and did not attempt to figure out, and that would be an issue for a later day if the Court said that that mattered.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Mr. Dreeben, I think, you know, in essence your argument goes like this: You have Monsanto, you combine Monsanto with a -- a simple factual acknowledgment that money is fungible, and it gets you to a judgment in this case. You win, the petitioner loses. And -- and, you know, that's a fair, strong argument, if -- if one is comfortable with Monsanto. I mean, there is -- so I think I would just ask you, I mean, suppose the Court is just uncomfortable with the path we started down the road on in Monsanto? And you might be right that it just doesn't make sense to draw a line here, but it leaves you with a situation in which more and more and more we're depriving people of the ability to hire counsel of choice in complicated cases. And so what should we do with that intuition that Monsanto sent us down the wrong path?<\/turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: Well, I -- I would hope that the Court sees that even if there are some uncomfortable aspects of Monsanto, it actually rests on a sound legal judgment. And I -- I realize I have said this, but I will keep coming back to this because I think it is the touchstone for Monsanto. Caplin & Drysdale was a postjudgment case. And it said once these funds are forfeitable, the defendant, if he pays his lawyer with them, is paying the lawyer with somebody else's money, namely, the government. Then the question is, can the government do anything to prevent dissipation of the assets before it obtains the judgment? And the Court said not automatically, not as a general rule it can always come in and say this is what we want, this is what we get. But with an appropriate hearing, the balance of interest does permit the government to preserve the equities. Now, this has an effect on counsel of choice. It has no effect on the ability of the defendant to be represented by counsel.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Counsel, how -- I don't know how these things work. Let's say you get an order freezing the assets, and it's $10 million, and -- and the defendant comes into the court, whatever, and says, look, my lawyer is going to cost $100,000, one percent of the assets that are at issue here. Then you would argue, no, even though it's only a tiny fraction of what we're seizing, the Sixth Amendment doesn't even entitle him to one percent of the assets that might -- might end up being forfeitable?<\/turn>\n<turn>Michael R. Dreeben: Yes. I don't think there's an exception in the Sixth Amendment. Now, this is a statute in which the government proceeded through seeking a civil injunction and restraining order, and the district court does have discretion. It's not a flat rule that forbids the district court from releasing funds for counsel.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: How does it work?

Alito, Jr.: Why would that be -- why would that even be permitted?<\/turn>\n<turn>Jonathan A. Herstoff: Why -- why would it be permitted to --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Yeah. Why would that -- why would the filing of a motion for reconsideration, which is nowhere mentioned in the Rules of Civil Procedure, toll the time for filing an appeal?<\/turn>\n<turn>Jonathan A. Herstoff: Because, there, this Court has long held that a timely reconsideration motion will suspend the time to appeal. And in the Dieter, Healy, and Ibarra line of cases, those dealt with the criminal rules, where there is no specific provision for reconsideration motions.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, it might be that -- that filing it within the period allowed under the particular rule at issue here would toll the time to appeal, but I don't see where anything -- I'm not sure the basis for the idea that filing a motion -- forget about Rule 23 for the moment -- filing a motion for reconsideration, so-called, tolls the time to appeal. As I said, there's no mention of that in the Rules of Civil Procedure. And the Rules of Appellate Procedure set out quite clearly the particular motions that toll the time for filing a notice of appeal, and there's no mention there of a motion for reconsideration. There's a motion -- it mentions the motion to alter or amend the judgment.<\/turn>\n<turn>Jonathan A. Herstoff: Well, I think the -- this Court's decision in Ibarra explains this well. And the Court explained that the reason that reconsideration motions toll the time to appeal is to give the district court an opportunity to correct their own alleged errors and to prevent unnecessary burdens from being placed on the court of appeals. I think that's -- that's shown here, where you have a record on the class certification. The district court is familiar with the record. The district court here specifically said only 10 days after the decertification order that it was going to entertain reconsideration briefing. And during that time, the court agreed to suspend summary judgment proceedings, other pretrial proceedings, and trial. So this was a considerable pause in the proceedings so that the district court would have a chance to reconsider before the case went up on appeal. And that -- I think that makes a lot of sense. And I think the courts should not be discouraged from reconsidering before it goes up to the court of appeals.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But there's nothing inconsistent with the 14-day limit of seeking permission to appeal and making a motion to reconsider. You could do both.<\/turn>\n<turn>Jonathan A. Herstoff: It's true that you could do both, but then you'd have the district court and the court of appeals considering the exact same order at the same time. And this Court has long held that the district courts and the courts of appeals should not be --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Well, the court of appeals says we'll wait -- we'll wait on the district court's decision on the motion for reconsideration.<\/turn>\n<turn>Jonathan A. Herstoff: The court of appeals would have the discretion to stay their proceedings, just like district courts have discretion to stay their proceedings. But -- but, still, you'd have the same on the order that's up at both the court of appeals and at the district court.

Alito, Jr.: Why would that be -- why would that even be permitted?<\/turn>\n<turn>Jonathan A. Herstoff: Why -- why would it be permitted to --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Yeah. Why would that -- why would the filing of a motion for reconsideration, which is nowhere mentioned in the Rules of Civil Procedure, toll the time for filing an appeal?<\/turn>\n<turn>Jonathan A. Herstoff: Because, there, this Court has long held that a timely reconsideration motion will suspend the time to appeal. And in the Dieter, Healy, and Ibarra line of cases, those dealt with the criminal rules, where there is no specific provision for reconsideration motions.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, it might be that -- that filing it within the period allowed under the particular rule at issue here would toll the time to appeal, but I don't see where anything -- I'm not sure the basis for the idea that filing a motion -- forget about Rule 23 for the moment -- filing a motion for reconsideration, so-called, tolls the time to appeal. As I said, there's no mention of that in the Rules of Civil Procedure. And the Rules of Appellate Procedure set out quite clearly the particular motions that toll the time for filing a notice of appeal, and there's no mention there of a motion for reconsideration. There's a motion -- it mentions the motion to alter or amend the judgment.<\/turn>\n<turn>Jonathan A. Herstoff: Well, I think the -- this Court's decision in Ibarra explains this well. And the Court explained that the reason that reconsideration motions toll the time to appeal is to give the district court an opportunity to correct their own alleged errors and to prevent unnecessary burdens from being placed on the court of appeals. I think that's -- that's shown here, where you have a record on the class certification. The district court is familiar with the record. The district court here specifically said only 10 days after the decertification order that it was going to entertain reconsideration briefing. And during that time, the court agreed to suspend summary judgment proceedings, other pretrial proceedings, and trial. So this was a considerable pause in the proceedings so that the district court would have a chance to reconsider before the case went up on appeal. And that -- I think that makes a lot of sense. And I think the courts should not be discouraged from reconsidering before it goes up to the court of appeals.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But there's nothing inconsistent with the 14-day limit of seeking permission to appeal and making a motion to reconsider. You could do both.<\/turn>\n<turn>Jonathan A. Herstoff: It's true that you could do both, but then you'd have the district court and the court of appeals considering the exact same order at the same time. And this Court has long held that the district courts and the courts of appeals should not be --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Well, the court of appeals says we'll wait -- we'll wait on the district court's decision on the motion for reconsideration.<\/turn>\n<turn>Jonathan A. Herstoff: The court of appeals would have the discretion to stay their proceedings, just like district courts have discretion to stay their proceedings. But -- but, still, you'd have the same on the order that's up at both the court of appeals and at the district court. And I think it makes more sense to say that when the reconsideration motion is pending at the district court, there should be no need to file a petition for permission to appeal.<\/turn>\n<\/context>\n<justice>Justice Elena Kagan<\/justice>\nGenerate a question that Justice Elena Kagan is likely to ask next.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nHere's a potential question from Justice Elena Kagan:\n\n\"Counsel, doesn't the fact that the district court has discretion to stay its own proceedings suggest that the court of appeals should also have discretion to decide whether to stay its proceedings pending a motion for reconsideration?

But one thing that I think is critically important is that those practical considerations the Court said expressly in Guerrero-Lasprilla may be relevant to standard of review, but they're not relevant to whether there's judicial review at all. And I think the reason for that is important. That's because standard of review and reviewability have just totally different frameworks. Reviewability looks at -- it's just purely an exercise in statutory construction. So you're looking at the canons of statutory interpretation. But, when you're looking at standard of review, you use different decision-making criteria. So you'll look at for one thing is there a long and a consistent history of appellate practice.

Mixed questions are sometimes reviewed de novo, they're sometimes reviewed for clear error, they're sometimes reviewed for abuse of discretion, but they're still all mixed questions. And I think that comparative analysis that Your Honor points to is very similar to extraordinary circumstances determinations under -- for untimely asylum petitions and due diligence.

David Breemer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Requiring Ms. Knick to prosecute her federal takings claim in state court conflicts with Section 1983 and is incompatible with the nature of her claim. Her claim is not based on the government's failure to compensate. It's based on the township's failure to recognize that the imposition of an access easement is a Fifth Amendment taking that triggers a compensation requirement. Because lack of compensation is not an element of her federal takings claim, state compensation remedies do not bear on the presentation of the claim in federal court.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: How is it not an element of her claim? There's no violation unless she is denied just compensation?<\/turn>\n<turn>J. David Breemer: Well, Your Honor, in the inverse condemnation context, the problem is not that the government's violating the Just Compensation Clause by failing to pay. The problem is that it's depriving her of her right to just compensation because it does not recognize that it's -- an invasion of her property is a taking that triggers the entitlement to compensation.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, I thought that was the whole point of an inverse condemnation. They recognize that they owe her money, and the whole point of the process, which can be fairly elaborate, is that they're just trying to figure out how much. If it's not enough, then she can bring a claim. But it seems to me that it's imposing a considerable burden on the state or the local entities to say you've got to pay right away; in other words, go through some sort of process to figure out what you owe before you can even -- you know, it's -- it's simply a process to figure out how much is due.

So I don't understand. Can I ask another question, however? Assuming that you were right and that you had a federal cause of action or should have one under 1983, when this case goes to a federal court, why would a district court be -- abuse its discretion for abstaining under any of the three doctrines, Pullman, Louisiana Power & Light, or Colorado River? All of them say that district courts can abstain when a legal issue involves state law and that state law could obviate the federal proceeding. So one of two things can happen in the state court below.

Roberts, Jr.: We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-647, Knick versus the Township of Scott, Pennsylvania. Mr. Breemer.<\/turn>\n<turn>J. David Breemer: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Requiring Ms. Knick to prosecute her federal takings claim in state court conflicts with Section 1983 and is incompatible with the nature of her claim. Her claim is not based on the government's failure to compensate. It's based on the township's failure to recognize that the imposition of an access easement is a Fifth Amendment taking that triggers a compensation requirement. Because lack of compensation is not an element of her federal takings claim, state compensation remedies do not bear on the presentation of the claim in federal court.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: How is it not an element of her claim? There's no violation unless she is denied just compensation?<\/turn>\n<turn>J. David Breemer: Well, Your Honor, in the inverse condemnation context, the problem is not that the government's violating the Just Compensation Clause by failing to pay. The problem is that it's depriving her of her right to just compensation because it does not recognize that it's -- an invasion of her property is a taking that triggers the entitlement to compensation.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, I thought that was the whole point of an inverse condemnation. They recognize that they owe her money, and the whole point of the process, which can be fairly elaborate, is that they're just trying to figure out how much. If it's not enough, then she can bring a claim. But it seems to me that it's imposing a considerable burden on the state or the local entities to say you've got to pay right away; in other words, go through some sort of process to figure out what you owe before you can even -- you know, it's -- it's simply a process to figure out how much is due. I don't know why it's such a problem to make her go through that in the initial instance.<\/turn>\n<turn>J.

This is -- sovereign immunity is a federal issue that preempts the state law and the merits of the underlying decision as it pertains to that.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Mr. Hawkins, I mean, I guess the question is, what is sovereign immunity and what does it entail? Even beyond the footnote in Bay Mills that the Chief Justice referenced, I think when you look at language of the kind that appears in Bay Mills and in other cases, what -- which says that, you know, if Congress wants to change it, it's up to Congress to change it, but the question is, what is the \"it\"? In other words, what's up to Congress to change is deviations from the general law of sovereign immunity. And I think what the Lundgrens are saying here is that this is not part of the general law of sovereign immunity. And this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question, that sovereign immunity typically, by common law and historically, includes this exception for immovable property. And so that's the baseline. It's, well, sovereign immunity, as it historically exists, except as it historically exists, it just didn't include immunity from suits that related to immovable property.<\/turn>\n<turn>David S.

So the -- the Court has consistently recognized that immunity is in the hands of the political branches. Now you ask how does this relate to Indian tribes and the significance and what is \"it\". For a landless tribe like the Upper Skagit, sovereign immunity has enabled it to purchase lands, take them into trust, and establish their reservation, providing services for their members, without being subject to third-party claims.

As the current LaFave treatise that's cited in our brief makes clear -- this is on page 457 -- the specific words that a criminal complicity statute uses can have some effect on how it's interpreted, the particular subset of conduct that it covers. And I think here Congress's focus on the words \"encourage\" and \"induce\" mean three things. First of all, it has to be something that the defendant actually wants to bring about or wants to succeed. I don't think you can be indifferent about encouraging or inducing. Second, it has to be something that the alien is aware of. Under normal aiding and abetting law, you could aid and abet -- if it uses the words \"aid and abet,\" you can aid and abet without the principal knowing about it. If a murderer is about to go shoot somebody and I unload the victim's gun without -- before the murderer gets there and the murderer never knows I did it, I'm still an aider and an abetter. And then the third thing is we think it requires some substantial amount of participation. And the reason for that is that you can't really encourage -- we've been very consistent about this in the proceedings below too, that you can't really encourage or induce someone in -- in a de minimis way. It has to be something that really does make the activity more likely to succeed or more likely to occur.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: So, if the -- if the defendant just says, well, I encourage you to stay here, that might not be enough, but, if the defendant says it 10 times in a forceful voice, that would be a violation?<\/turn>\n<turn>Eric J. Feigin: I don't think that kind of more abstract attenuated exhortation is really going to satisfy this particular statute. One additional reason why -- one additional reason why we think some substantial participation is required is because this is coming in clause iv of a five-clause statute. And if you look at clauses i through iii, which cover the other kinds of substantive conduct here, all of them require some sort of substantial participation --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: But what do you mean by \"substantial participation\"? Because I didn't really take that from your brief, so I'm a little bit confused as to where that's coming from. And, again, what Justice Alito said, I mean, if somebody says I really think you should stay here, here are the 10 reasons why, and repeats that and repeats that, and it's -- it's very definitely encouraging and inducing a person to stay in this country, does that count as substantial participation, or is there some non-speech conduct that has to be added to the mix?<\/turn>\n<turn>Eric J. Feigin: Well, Your Honor, I think there are occasions in the criminal law where words can constitute aiding and abetting, and I think that the same is true under this statute. If the Court were to have a problem with that, it could either be addressed through as-applied challenges, as the Chief Justice has mentioned, or, again, we would prefer, to the Ninth Circuit's remedy, something that says that it has to be accompanied -- an interpretation that says that it has to be accompanied by some conduct. But I don't --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Mr. Feigin --<\/turn>\n<turn>Eric J.

Normally, in the criminal law when we -- in secondary liability, to avoid the First Amendment, we, as Justice Breyer suggested, don't allow punishment for speech greater than the underlying conduct itself. That would seem to be a basic First Amendment value. So what do we do about the fact that most applications, maybe not all, but most applications here of the underlying conduct would be civilly punished? And here you wish to criminally punish the speech, number one. And, number two, normally we require the aider and abetter or secondary liable person to have a purpose shared with the defendant, the same purpose. And, here, the government, as I understand it, argued that there's no mens rea required to prove this violation or a very minimal one.<\/turn>\n<turn>Eric J.

As the current LaFave treatise that's cited in our brief makes clear -- this is on page 457 -- the specific words that a criminal complicity statute uses can have some effect on how it's interpreted, the particular subset of conduct that it covers. And I think here Congress's focus on the words \"encourage\" and \"induce\" mean three things. First of all, it has to be something that the defendant actually wants to bring about or wants to succeed. I don't think you can be indifferent about encouraging or inducing. Second, it has to be something that the alien is aware of. Under normal aiding and abetting law, you could aid and abet -- if it uses the words \"aid and abet,\" you can aid and abet without the principal knowing about it.

Brown:  So I think that the difference there is that that provision in Santos -Zacaria, which says notwithstanding any other provision of law, a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals, in accordance with this section, shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review, that provision is not the jurisdictional grant, and so it's not conditioning the Court's jurisdiction on appeals filed or orders filed in accordance with this section. There's another section of 1252 that granted jurisdiction. So I think we would have a much harder argument and, again, maybe an impossible one if the Court had rejected our reading of a provision that said something like the court of appeals shall have jurisdiction to review removal orders in accordance with this section.

Can the -- can the argument be forfeited?  Our cases have gone off on  really niggling interpretations of statutory language that doesn't speak at all directly and only very  -- in a very loose way indirectly to this question, but part of your argument  gets at perhaps something we could read into this which would be more productive, which is to ask what is it likely that Congress intended with respect to a particular type of review, and you're talking about review from an administrative agency to a  -- to a court of appeals.

I think a jury could -- a rational jury could find that's a single criminal episode, especially against the backdrop of what ACCA is trying to accomplish with the different occasions clause. Remember, what you're trying to accomplish is identifying career offenders,  people who have a long practice of offending. And so somebody who goes on a single bender or  executes a single plan is not the kind of person that ACCA seems to be trying to identify.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Thank you.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan?<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan:  There's been some talk in the briefs about the exact scope of the Almendarez -Torres exception. Do those questions get litigated, or are they entirely academic, and does it matter, the exact scope for this case?<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L. Fisher:  It doesn't matter, the exact scope for this case, because all the Court has to do is apply the rule that's announced in Descamps and Mathis, which is any offense-related conduct that goes beyond the elements is covered by Apprendi, not Almendarez -Torres. That's enough to decide this case. So, Justice Kagan, there are a few other facts. Candidly, there are not many cases  about them because there aren't very many recidivist statutes that deal with something like the date of the offense or other kinds of facts that are about  --I'm not going to say never, but there is very little case law on it. And something like, you know, these other kind of facts are  -- are, again, rarely going to be litigated because the defendant may  not have any legitimate argument when it comes to, you know, these other kind of facts.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch?<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I just want to explore a little bit about what happens on remand, not that we need to address it but just to pick your brain for a minute.<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L. Fisher:  Yeah.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Our line between what is susceptible to harmless error review and what is structural error, I confess, sometimes defies me. On the one hand, it's structural error if you don't have a reasonable doubt instruction or if you have been denied your choice of counsel. On the other hand, it's susceptible to harmless error review if you didn't instruct the jury with respect to  an element of the crime or if there's a variance.<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L. Fisher:  Right.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Here, we have the plea bargaining context, so we don't even have a trial record to analyze for harmless error review. So I'm -- I'm a bit uncertain how one  would do harmless error review, other than look at the very records that you want to be able to challenge before a jury, right?  You -- you  --you may be taking judicial notice that he did it on such and such a date and he did this in -- in a certain place.<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L. Fisher:  Right.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  How does that work? How do you do harmless error review when you don't have a trial record?  And  --let me add one more thing in there, a lot, I know -- here, your client pleaded to an information that listed as the ACCA predicate offense different crimes, so he didn't even have notice that the government was going to reach back to when he was 18 or thereabouts for this string of burglaries to enhance his sentence by 15 years. And he's now in his mid 40s so that he'll never -- he won't get out of prison until he's in his -- maybe 60 or so. And how do we analyze, oh, it was harmless that he didn't even know what he was pleading guilty to?<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L. Fisher:  I think you're right there are challenges even with conducting a Neder-type harmless error analysis after a jury verdict. Justice Scalia pointed out in dissent in that case that becomes a very difficult speculative enterprise. Of course, the majority of the Court disagreed. And the Court has also disagreed when it comes to indictments. So I don't want to butt myself too hard up against the Court's precedent, but I do think you make a good point that when it comes to cases where you have plea bargains, the question whether a jury might have found something or not requires, you know, a very unusual showing on the government's part that it's absolutely so clear based on the kind of documents that we all agree a court can look at under the Almendarez-Torres exception itself. So you're going to have some cases where the dates of conviction are so far apart or other things like that that I think, you know, are going to be harmless, but I  --I think that just bolsters my answer to Justice Sotomayor as to why we have a serious harmless error -- or not harmless error argument on remand.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

Candidly, there are not many cases  about them because there aren't very many recidivist statutes that deal with something like the date of the offense or other kinds of facts that are about  --I'm not going to say never, but there is very little case law on it. And something like, you know, these other kind of facts are  -- are, again, rarely going to be litigated because the defendant may  not have any legitimate argument when it comes to, you know, these other kind of facts.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch?<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I just want to explore a little bit about what happens on remand, not that we need to address it but just to pick your brain for a minute.<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L. Fisher:  Yeah.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Our line between what is susceptible to harmless error review and what is structural error, I confess, sometimes defies me. On the one hand, it's structural error if you don't have a reasonable doubt instruction or if you have been denied your choice of counsel. On the other hand, it's susceptible to harmless error review if you didn't instruct the jury with respect to  an element of the crime or if there's a variance.<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L. Fisher:  Right.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Here, we have the plea bargaining context, so we don't even have a trial record to analyze for harmless error review. So I'm -- I'm a bit uncertain how one  would do harmless error review, other than look at the very records that you want to be able to challenge before a jury, right?  You -- you  --you may be taking judicial notice that he did it on such and such a date and he did this in -- in a certain place.<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L. Fisher:  Right.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  How does that work? How do you do harmless error review when you don't have a trial record?  And  --let me add one more thing in there, a lot, I know -- here, your client pleaded to an information that listed as the ACCA predicate offense different crimes, so he didn't even have notice that the government was going to reach back to when he was 18 or thereabouts for this string of burglaries to enhance his sentence by 15 years. And he's now in his mid 40s so that he'll never -- he won't get out of prison until he's in his -- maybe 60 or so. And how do we analyze, oh, it was harmless that he didn't even know what he was pleading guilty to?<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L. Fisher:  I think you're right there are challenges even with conducting a Neder-type harmless error analysis after a jury verdict. Justice Scalia pointed out in dissent in that case that becomes a very difficult speculative enterprise. Of course, the majority of the Court disagreed. And the Court has also disagreed when it comes to indictments. So I don't want to butt myself too hard up against the Court's precedent, but I do think you make a good point that when it comes to cases where you have plea bargains, the question whether a jury might have found something or not requires, you know, a very unusual showing on the government's part that it's absolutely so clear based on the kind of documents that we all agree a court can look at under the Almendarez-Torres exception itself. So you're going to have some cases where the dates of conviction are so far apart or other things like that that I think, you know, are going to be harmless, but I  --I think that just bolsters my answer to Justice Sotomayor as to why we have a serious harmless error -- or not harmless error argument on remand.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

Yang: That's correct.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Even though Congress can regulate that transaction?<\/turn>\n<turn>Anthony A. Yang: Well, there -- there would be a question. I think that there are arguments to be made that would go beyond the arguments that we're making here, and we're not pressing those today for various reasons. I think as the Court has recognized, this is an area of some difficulty at times. Lopez recognizes that commercial power is necessarily one of degree, and that the Court's decisions have not provided precise formulation in the nature of things it cannot. And so what we're -- the Court -- I'm sorry -- but the Court's taken an incremental approach, and we're doing something similar here.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: I asked Mr. Jones whether the Hobbs Act exercises the full measure of Congress's Commerce Clause, an authority which I thought a number of cases have said. Do you agree with that?<\/turn>\n<turn>Anthony A. Yang: It does. It does. Not only that, but I think --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Because then you do run into these limitation -- in the search for a limiting principle, which you seem to be addressing. So Congress could prohibit and has prohibited a person from possessing even a very small amount of marijuana, right, a single cigarette, a single marijuana cigarette?<\/turn>\n<turn>Anthony A. Yang: That's correct.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: So if one person steals a marijuana cigarette from another person, robs that person of one marijuana cigarette, that's a violation of the Hobbs Act?<\/turn>\n<turn>Anthony A. Yang: Well, there's a different argument there, and let me tell you why. The pure possession -- and we're not talking about the actual trade in marijuana but just the personal possession, that raises different questions. That was addressed by Raich. Now, there is an argument that could be made that that would fall within the Hobbs Act. At the same time --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: It falls within the Commerce Clause, doesn't it?<\/turn>\n<turn>Anthony A. Yang: It falls -- certainly the possession is something that Congress can regulate as Raich teaches. Now, whether the robbery of one possessing, that's yet additional -- an additional link into the Commerce Clause inquiry. And what I can say is that the courts of appeals have recognized, as this Court has, the -- in a search for the outer limits of the Commerce Clause, the courts have pulled back and they've suggested that when you're robbing just a mere individual who's not a business or engaged in a business in the -- in the context of the robbery, that raises different questions and it's much more difficult to establish necessary nexus. We're not actually taking that on in this case because we don't think we have to.

So you're saying there's been no absolute -- there's been no prosecution except Henderson, which was a -- a woman who hired a housekeeper who told her the absolute truth: If you go back, you -- you're not -- if you go -- if you return to your country, you may not get back.

I don't think either of those things is protected by the First Amendment. As to the Henderson case, I think there are more facts and context in that case.

The statute has never been used, to my knowledge, and Respondent and her amici have not come up with an instance where it's been used, to prosecute conduct of the type that you're hypothesizing, Justice Kavanaugh.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Mr. Feigin, but it has been used, according to the Amnesty International brief, and DHS admitted that there was a watch list at the border in which these charitable organizations, people who were giving legal advice at the border, all sorts of individuals were being watched because they potentially violated this encouragement provision and inducement provision. So you're saying there's been no absolute -- there's been no prosecution except Henderson, which was a -- a woman who hired a housekeeper who told her the absolute truth: If you go back, you -- you're not -- if you go -- if you return to your country, you may not get back. Absolutely true statement, and she was prosecuted for that true statement as an encouragement and inducement for the housekeeper to stay here. But, if you say this has no chilling effect, is that accurate?<\/turn>\n<turn>Eric J. Feigin: Well, Your Honor, let me take those two examples in turn. First of all, the Amnesty International letter, if you look at it, the DHS conduct in that case was focused on investigating instances of violence against border patrol agents and suspicions that people were being counseled to lie to immigration officials. I don't think either of those things is protected by the First Amendment. As to the Henderson case, I think there are more facts and context in that case. That was the prosecution -- and I -- I -- I will acknowledge that that case is very close to the line of what we think the statute could permissibly cover.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Could I ask one question? If this lawyer had sincerely believed, because, in fact, it was true or close to the truth, if she just got it wrong, that there was a lawful program that these individuals could have accessed to keep them here, would you have been able to prosecute her?<\/turn>\n<turn>Eric J. Feigin: No, Your Honor, we couldn't have. And I think that goes back to what I was saying to Justice --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: May I just interrupt you one second?<\/turn>\n<turn>Eric J.

What if we -- let's say that I theoretically agree with you that under Guerrero-Lasprilla, mixed questions, including of this sort, would be subject to judicial review. Wouldn't you say -- and I guess I'd push back a little bit on your characterization of Wilkinson's claims in particular below as being of that variety because, you know, I looked at the record. His claims, you know, the immigration judge, he claimed that the immigration judge wrongly speculated about the care and support the child would receive if the Petitioner was removed. They all read like weighing ones. He found, while Wilkinson does provide emotional support, removing him would result in minimal emotional hardship because his son clearly has lived without Wilkinson's daily presence for most of his life because the mother had primary custody. So doesn't it seem like you're just seeking or that your client was seeking a reweighing of those facts and so that under Patel, they really would be not subject to review?<\/turn>\n<turn>Jaime A.

Why would -- what kind of guarantee would that provide in the future that he would not be put back on if just one additional relevant factor were added? What would that achieve?<\/turn>\n<turn>Gadeir Abbas: Yeah, it would depend, Your Honor, on the reasons that were disclosed. And I know, Your Honor, that's a frustrating answer to have to provide, but it -- but it turns on the reasons because, depending on what those reasons are, the court could reach a conclusion that recurrence is very likely because this is the normal and typical operation of the program, perhaps the program allows for the consideration of unlawful reasons, or it was aberrational, there was some kind of exceptional circumstance that gave rise to his listing. And the effectiveness of the declaration would be -- would depend on the -- the reasons disclosed.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, what if there are no unlawful reasons? Is that central to your argument, that there was an unlawful reason that he was put on for a reason that violates his free exercise right?<\/turn>\n<turn>Gadeir Abbas: At the voluntary cessation stage, Your Honor, it's just the challenged conduct. The court can defer its adjudication of the lawfulness of the procedures, the lawfulness of the reasons to the merits. Right now, yes, we challenged the reasons why they listed him and we challenged the procedures why they listed him.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A.

Which or both?<\/turn>\n<turn>Gadeir Abbas: It could be both, Your Honor. Both in the sense that the government used the bare fact, for example, of his lawful, peaceful associations in his religious community as a basis for his listing, or it could be that the standard was inadequate -- was so low that it allowed anything to sail right through to the list.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: If -- if --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Can -- go ahead.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: If -- if we thought that a reasonable way to deal with this really quite difficult situation is for the government to do what it does on the merits part of the cases and go in and tell the judge in -- in camera why the person was listed and why the person was taken off and what it has to say about why the person won't be taken off, do you know anything about how that process works? Is -- is counsel part of that process typically when it's a substantive issue? And do you want to say anything about whether counsel has to be part of that process?<\/turn>\n<turn>Gadeir Abbas: Sure, Your Honor. A few thoughts. The government, generally speaking, does provide some kind of explanation as to the reasons for a person's watchlisting publicly even. And so this is an exceptional case where they provided no information at all. In -- in other watchlist cases, the government, for example, in Latif v. Holder, provided an extensive series of ex parte in camera declarations to supplement some of the public descriptions, and I believe there was a mixture of access that was provided to counsel in -- in that case.

Alito, Jr.: Can I --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Would you answer --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: -- come back to the question of what might be said in a declaration that would be sufficient to show that it was sufficiently unlikely that he would be put back on the list? Short of repudiation or a change of circumstances, am I correct that your answer is that there must be a disclosure of the reasons why he was on in the first place?<\/turn>\n<turn>Gadeir Abbas: For the substantive due process claim, yes, Your Honor, we think that a disclosure of some kind is the only way for establishing a baseline that the court can then compare a promise to.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: And suppose that's disclosed and you see, well, there was this combination of factors and the government inferred from that that the standard was met. Why would -- what kind of guarantee would that provide in the future that he would not be put back on if just one additional relevant factor were added? What would that achieve?<\/turn>\n<turn>Gadeir Abbas: Yeah, it would depend, Your Honor, on the reasons that were disclosed. And I know, Your Honor, that's a frustrating answer to have to provide, but it -- but it turns on the reasons because, depending on what those reasons are, the court could reach a conclusion that recurrence is very likely because this is the normal and typical operation of the program, perhaps the program allows for the consideration of unlawful reasons, or it was aberrational, there was some kind of exceptional circumstance that gave rise to his listing. And the effectiveness of the declaration would be -- would depend on the -- the reasons disclosed.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, what if there are no unlawful reasons? Is that central to your argument, that there was an unlawful reason that he was put on for a reason that violates his free exercise right?<\/turn>\n<turn>Gadeir Abbas: At the voluntary cessation stage, Your Honor, it's just the challenged conduct. The court can defer its adjudication of the lawfulness of the procedures, the lawfulness of the reasons to the merits. Right now, yes, we challenged the reasons why they listed him and we challenged the procedures why they listed him.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: But you -- you challenged the lawfulness of -- of individual reasons or you challenged the conclusion that the evidence that was available to the government was insufficient -- was sufficient to satisfy the -- the -- the standard? Which or both?<\/turn>\n<turn>Gadeir Abbas: It could be both, Your Honor. Both in the sense that the government used the bare fact, for example, of his lawful, peaceful associations in his religious community as a basis for his listing, or it could be that the standard was inadequate -- was so low that it allowed anything to sail right through to the list.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: If -- if --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Can -- go ahead.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: If -- if we thought that a reasonable way to deal with this really quite difficult situation is for the government to do what it does on the merits part of the cases and go in and tell the judge in -- in camera why the person was listed and why the person was taken off and what it has to say about why the person won't be taken off, do you know anything about how that process works? Is -- is counsel part of that process typically when it's a substantive issue? And do you want to say anything about whether counsel has to be part of that process?<\/turn>\n<turn>Gadeir Abbas: Sure, Your Honor. A few thoughts. The government, generally speaking, does provide some kind of explanation as to the reasons for a person's watchlisting publicly even. And so this is an exceptional case where they provided no information at all. In -- in other watchlist cases, the government, for example, in Latif v. Holder, provided an extensive series of ex parte in camera declarations to supplement some of the public descriptions, and I believe there was a mixture of access that was provided to counsel in -- in that case. But some of the information that gets disclosed ends up being designated as sensitive security information. We've gotten cleared on that -- on that basis. But, you know -- so there are all those options, but the government had all those options before they got to this Court. And so, before 2018, they decided -- in the first application of voluntary cessation doctrine to this case, they didn't provide any declaration.

Roberts, Jr.: We'll hear argument next in Case 20-1009, Shinn versus Ramirez. Mr. Roysden.<\/turn>\n<turn>Brunn W. Roysden III: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue presented in this case is fundamentally a question of statutory interpretation. When Congress enacted 2254(e)(2) as part of AEDPA, it created a high bar for federal evidentiary hearings on habeas claims involving state convictions. It codified the first part of the Keeney test in the opening part of (e)(2) by echoing the words \"failure to develop\" from Keeney. And this Court, in Williams and Holland, has already held that attorney negligence counts as failure to develop under (e)(2) based on agency principles. If a failure to develop has occurred, Congress did not merely repeat Keeney and Coleman's cause and prejudice test for excusing it but, rather, supplanted it by specifying in subsections (A) and (B) of (e)(2) the cause and prejudice required. Congress thus spoke clearly, and the courts' role is to apply the statutory language. That no fact-finder could have found the prisoner guilty is not enough. The prisoner must also satisfy (e)(2)(A) by showing either a new rule of constitutional law or that the factual predicate could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence. This is an intentionally high bar. Respondents rely on Martinez to create an additional exception to (e)(2) beyond (A) and (B). That proposition fails. Martinez was addressing cause for the cause and prejudice test for excusing a procedural default. Congress did not codify the procedural default or the excuses for overcoming it in AEDPA. In contrast, Congress did affirmatively codify the circumstances under which cause and prejudice is established to permit an evidentiary hearing following a failure to develop under (e)(2). Martinez's judge-made rule cannot rewrite Congress's statutory questions -- standard. I invite questions from the Court.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Clarence Thomas: Counsel, the -- it seems rather odd that you would -- we would allow a -- we will excuse a default under Martinez but not allow the prisoner to make his underlying claim or develop his evidence -- evidentiary basis for his underlying claim.<\/turn>\n<turn>Brunn W. Roysden III: Well, Your Honor, Martinez did not consider this question. Martinez --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Clarence Thomas: Yeah, I understand that. But it's not -- it seems pretty worthless to have -- to say, well, you have -- we'll excuse a procedural default. To what end?<\/turn>\n<turn>Brunn W. Roysden III: In some cases, there may already be evidence in the state court record.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Clarence Thomas: Okay. Let's take this case. To what end if you're not allowed to develop the underlying claim?<\/turn>\n<turn>Brunn W. Roysden III: Well, on this case, our position is that there -- the court -- the district court should not have gone into a Martinez hearing in Jones without looking whether there was enough state court -- state record evidence to establish ineffective assistance of trial counsel in the first place. It's a -- it's a fruitless exercise. But that doesn't mean that Martinez can overcome the statutory language. The court should simply cut it off at the beginning. In the Ramirez case, the evidence just wasn't there either way. And so -- so the short answer is Martinez can be accommodated. The district court just shouldn't go down the path of -- of having a Martinez hearing if there's not going to be state court evidence to establish the ultimate claim.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: But it's a basic syllogism. The idea is, if you do get the right to raise the claim for the first time, because your counsel was incompetent before, surely, you have the right to get the evidence that's necessary to support your claim. I mean, the whole reason some states say you shouldn't raise your incompetence claim until after the direct proceedings is that it's much more efficient and natural to have an evidentiary hearing at that time, rather when you're halfway up the chain between the trial court and the court of appeals.<\/turn>\n<turn>Brunn W. Roysden III: I -- I think Judge Collins in his dissent pointed out the flaw in that logic, which is there's asymmetric intervention here. Congress did specify in (e)(2) when you can have a hearing. So the -- the problem is the major premise of that syllogism is faulty. There's not a --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

Congress thus spoke clearly, and the courts' role is to apply the statutory language. That no fact-finder could have found the prisoner guilty is not enough. The prisoner must also satisfy (e)(2)(A) by showing either a new rule of constitutional law or that the factual predicate could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence. This is an intentionally high bar. Respondents rely on Martinez to create an additional exception to (e)(2) beyond (A) and (B). That proposition fails. Martinez was addressing cause for the cause and prejudice test for excusing a procedural default. Congress did not codify the procedural default or the excuses for overcoming it in AEDPA. In contrast, Congress did affirmatively codify the circumstances under which cause and prejudice is established to permit an evidentiary hearing following a failure to develop under (e)(2). Martinez's judge-made rule cannot rewrite Congress's statutory questions -- standard. I invite questions from the Court.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Clarence Thomas: Counsel, the -- it seems rather odd that you would -- we would allow a -- we will excuse a default under Martinez but not allow the prisoner to make his underlying claim or develop his evidence -- evidentiary basis for his underlying claim.<\/turn>\n<turn>Brunn W. Roysden III: Well, Your Honor, Martinez did not consider this question. Martinez --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Clarence Thomas: Yeah, I understand that. But it's not -- it seems pretty worthless to have -- to say, well, you have -- we'll excuse a procedural default. To what end?<\/turn>\n<turn>Brunn W. Roysden III: In some cases, there may already be evidence in the state court record.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Clarence Thomas: Okay. Let's take this case. To what end if you're not allowed to develop the underlying claim?<\/turn>\n<turn>Brunn W. Roysden III: Well, on this case, our position is that there -- the court -- the district court should not have gone into a Martinez hearing in Jones without looking whether there was enough state court -- state record evidence to establish ineffective assistance of trial counsel in the first place. It's a -- it's a fruitless exercise. But that doesn't mean that Martinez can overcome the statutory language. The court should simply cut it off at the beginning. In the Ramirez case, the evidence just wasn't there either way. And so -- so the short answer is Martinez can be accommodated. The district court just shouldn't go down the path of -- of having a Martinez hearing if there's not going to be state court evidence to establish the ultimate claim.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: But it's a basic syllogism. The idea is, if you do get the right to raise the claim for the first time, because your counsel was incompetent before, surely, you have the right to get the evidence that's necessary to support your claim. I mean, the whole reason some states say you shouldn't raise your incompetence claim until after the direct proceedings is that it's much more efficient and natural to have an evidentiary hearing at that time, rather when you're halfway up the chain between the trial court and the court of appeals.<\/turn>\n<turn>Brunn W. Roysden III: I -- I think Judge Collins in his dissent pointed out the flaw in that logic, which is there's asymmetric intervention here. Congress did specify in (e)(2) when you can have a hearing. So the -- the problem is the major premise of that syllogism is faulty. There's not a --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, they specified that before our decision in Martinez, right?<\/turn>\n<turn>Brunn W. Roysden III: Could you -- sorry. Could you --<\/turn>\n<\/context>\n<justice>Justice John G.

Breyer: Whatever the case is, I'd like to get an answer to my question.<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: Sure.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: It says the Court should balance four factors: Length of delay, the reason for delay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant. Now, if I quote that sentence and say those are the factors that should be taken into account under the Due Process Clause, do you have any objection to that?<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: Prejudice needs to take the forefront in that analysis.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G. Breyer: I should just reverse the four?<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: Well, the problem with Barker is it held -- it holds that -- I mean, in the postconviction setting is that none of the factors are necessary. So prejudice doesn't necessarily have to be shown in Barker. Lower courts have modified that and said in the postconviction setting, a defendant has to show prejudice. In the -- the test that lower courts use, the modified Barker test looks a lot like Lovasco. In fact, it say it's indistinguishable because prejudice. And prejudice is the key, to the answer to your question, Justice Breyer, that in a postconviction setting, that's what's necessary. And also, to my friend's point that the Petitioner made claims of prejudice, I'd point the Court to Joint Appendix 66 and 68 where he -- he made his claim of prejudice in -- in the space of a couple paragraphs. And this sort of illustrates the problem the State has in rebutting claims of prejudice that aren't substantiated. He didn't file his -- his affidavit, which was still fairly bare, but at least more substantiated, until three months after he filed his motion, and the motion was denied, his motion to reconsider. So I think defendants in this context have to come forward with some showing of prejudice.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Well, that -- that might present some challenges, but there are also challenges on the other side. It's often hard to show that people have forgotten things, that, you know, they've forgotten them. So unless there's something like a witness dying, it's very difficult to make the kind of showing that you are suggesting. And that's why Barker, you know, left things flexible and said, you know, in most cases, we really are going to look at prejudice. We're going to see what you have to say for yourself. In some extreme cases, we're not going to do that. So, again, I guess I'm back with Justice Breyer's question as to, yes, this is a different context, but why don't all the same considerations apply?<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: The court has never presumed prejudice, except in the extreme --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: I wasn't suggesting presumed prejudice, because Barker doesn't suggest presumed prejudice. As you say, the difference that Barker has with respect to your test is simply that Barker says it's not always necessary to show prejudice, that there are extreme circumstances in which we'll just take that for granted.<\/turn>\n<turn>Dale Schowengerdt: I don't think that takes into consideration the change that happens at conviction. I mean, there's a substantial change. The -- the interests of the society take the forefront. And to give -- I think it gives the defendant a windfall if -- if he can come to court and say this, you know, delay has prejudiced me, but I'm not really going to --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Well, but if you think that a very significant part of this rule has to do with impairment of the ability to defend yourself, and if you think that that kind of consideration applies just as well at the sentencing phase as it does at the conviction stage, maybe in most cases more so, given that most of the action these days takes place in the sentencing phase, I guess I just wouldn't see why there's any need for a different rule, especially given the level of flexibility that Barker gives.

Eighty-three cases. And how many of those cases did the person driving the car know that the drugs were there? Eighty -three. Is that barred?<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L. Fisher:  I think that would be barred because it would be equivalent of saying defendants in this position always have the requisite mens rea.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, it's just a statement of fact about his  -- about his -- what he has personal knowledge of.<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L. Fisher:  Well, remember, the state -- the expert testimony here -- and this is at Pet. App. 13A -- was admitted as an expert opinion about whether the defendant had the requisite mens rea. It's opinion evidence --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Well, this isn't --<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L. Fisher:  -- not facts evidence.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Okay. So it would be okay if it's not opinion evidence?<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L. Fisher:  Well, I think it functionally would be opinion evidence regardless of whether you characterized it. But, Justice Alito, let me -- I think it might help the conversation if I explained the Ninth Circuit's rule raises really two questions. One is, is the expert testimony about mens rea and is it about the defendant?  And  -- and  -- and we agree with the  --with the Fifth Circuit rule that if you  --if the expert gives testimony that -- from which the jury can merely draw an inference about mens rea, that's perfectly fine, and there might be borderline cases about what's mens rea, but that's not this case because the expert used the word \"know.\" The expert used the word \"aware\".<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, can I test that  --<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L.

I think the reason why is because what the drafters of the rule cared about was not an absolute versus probabilistic opinion. What they cared about was the expert assigning a mens rea to the defendant or a class of people like the defendant. In other words, it's the subject of mens rea that's off limits, not  --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, I don't know that --<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L. Fisher:  -- absolute testimony.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  I  --I certainly don't have experience in  -- in trials, but  -- but I don't know that -- could he really say there's an 80 percent chance that this individual had drugs?  I think he would have to say more generally that 80 percent of the people that I've studied or whatever have drugs. I don't know that he can ascribe -- maybe he  shouldn't be able to ascribe a number to this individual.<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L. Fisher:  Well  --well --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

Fisher:  Right.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  -- is testifying about.<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L. Fisher:  Well, after Rule 704(b), of course, the expert couldn't, but I think, before Rule 704(b), an expert could say -- for example, an expert could say, absolutely, as happened in the Hinckley trial, I believe this defendant did not have the capacity to tell right from wrong, so, therefore, he is insane. And I think after -- and I think Congress would have prohibited that in Rule 704(b) just like it would prohibit the expert from saying I think most likely Mr. Hinckley was insane and couldn't tell right from wrong. And whether you say that in terms of a percentage or just a verbal locution that's \"probably,\" \"usually,\" \"most of the time,\" \"almost certainly,\" any of those things would be covered by the rule because they're all an opinion about whether the defendant had that mens rea.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  But, Mr. --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Samuel A.

I think the Chief Justice is trying to get at this problem, or I am: Lab technician Jones looks at a vial, and it's blue. She says to Smith, \"it's blue\". Smith turns a lever on a machine to B. Jason sees the B and goes into court -- you make him go into court; that's our case. And what I wonder is, is the defendant now entitled to the following instruction: Jury, because he's in court, he can say that the machine read B, but that proves nothing about the vial, nothing. All it proves is what someone said in the laboratory to another person, and those two people aren't in court. Now, that's -- you see, that's the problem, I think, of the intermediate step. I'd either like to be told I'm wrong about that, you don't have to have them, or explain whatever you'd like.<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L. Fisher: If I understand your hypothetical correctly, I think that if the defendant wanted -- the defendant can certainly make that argument to a jury, and the defendant, if he wanted to insist -- if the prosecution wanted to tie the results -- let's bring it back to the facts of this case -- wanted to tie the.21 to Mr. Bullcoming by saying that was Mr. Bullcoming's sample, then they'd need to bring somebody into court if the defendant insisted upon it. But the one thing I want to add is that the Public Defender Service brief makes clear, and the facts of this case make clear, it's going to be very rare that a defendant wants to do that. The defendant in this case wanted to stipulate to the nurse's blood draw and that it was his blood that was drawn in the hospital. It was the State that insisted on putting her on the stand. It happens in courtrooms all across the country.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: Well, but if you want to tell us, don't worry, it won't happen, I think that's an unacceptable argument. You're saying the defense has certain rights, and we have to presume there is a defense attorney who's going to afford his client every right the Constitution has. So the fact that we're not supposed to worry because it won't happen very often is (a) it seems to me, an unlikely hypothetical; and (b) it seems to me, irrelevant to your argument.<\/turn>\n<turn>Jeffrey L. Fisher: Well, Justice Kennedy, I will gladly accept (b) if we want to say that consequences are irrelevant, because I think that's what -- the Sixth Amendment is what it is, but I think the only thing I would add is that all I can say is, empirically, in the States that have followed the rule we advocate today, long before Crawford or Melendez-Diaz, it simply is a manageable burden. I'm not saying it's no burden. But it is a thoroughly manageable--<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Antonin Scalia: Mr. Fisher, I thought -- I thought the Court put this worry behind us in Crawford.

All right? So what you're saying is that there's no stigmatic harm to a disabled person in their ability to do what I do, look at a place and say: I may want to visit Venice, I may want to visit Florida, I may want to visit California, and I want information about all the sites there so I can decide what suits me best.

I'm sorry, Your Honor.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: With respect to standing, would it be sufficient if a plaintiff were to allege in -- in her complaint that she does intend to visit the hotel, period?<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: Yes, that would be enough for standing, Your Honor. Then the person -- then there's a downstream consequence from being deprived of the information. We haven't disputed that if there's a person with concrete travel plans who says, look, I want to --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Well, concrete travel. I'm talking about an allegation in a complaint, just I -- I -- I -- I may someday visit this hotel.<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: I don't think \"I may someday\" is enough. That kind of sounds like the allegations --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: \"I will someday.\"<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: \"I will\" -- I think \"I will\" -- \"someday\" probably is not enough either.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: \"Someday\" not good enough?<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: I don't think -- under the Lujan case, the Court held that someday plans aren't good enough for standing.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: In the next decade? (Laughter.)<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: I think it's got to be concrete plans. If you're -- if you're going to Wells next summer and you're trying to make a reservation at Coast Village, I think that's enough for standing.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: But that's not --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: With --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: -- the way people travel, counselor. When people travel, or at least when I do, and I think I'm not abnormal in this sense, I look at a place, I look at various sites to decide where I want to stay, I look at price points, I look at the level of accessibility, whatever. All right? So what you're saying is that there's no stigmatic harm to a disabled person in their ability to do what I do, look at a place and say: I may want to visit Venice, I may want to visit Florida, I may want to visit California, and I want information about all the sites there so I can decide what suits me best. And you're saying you need something much more concrete than that?<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: So --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: I've been deprived of my ability to make an informed choice about where to visit and I'm not harmed stigmatically?<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: Well, so it seems to me that if the person is traveling and is checking a few hotels and is trying to decide where to stay, but the person's planning to travel, then I think that there would be standing. Like, if you're saying I want to go to Ocean City and I'm looking at two or three hotels, not sure which one to stay at --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: But the person who says, I want to find the place to visit -- Ocean City, Atlantic City, whatever other city -- and now I'm doing my investigation of all three cities and I decide against your city because I couldn't find enough accessible places, I'm not harmed?<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: No, I don't -- I don't think so. I mean, I don't think that if you have no idea where you're going to go and you're just going to a hotel website for some randomly picked hotel in a city and see it's not accessible, but you don't have any --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: But why aren't I -- I don't understand. Discrimination, I thought, meant that I'm being treated differently than other people. If I go on a drive to a place and there's a sign up that says \"No disabled person is welcome,\" I've been discriminated against, correct?<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: Yes.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: What's different than my going to a website and the website saying nothing about disability, so I know I'm not welcome there?<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: Well, Your Honor, if you see the sign that says \"No disabled people welcome,\" I actually don't think that there's standing unless you want to enter the business. So, if you -- if you're on the internet and you see a sign of some business and --<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: So it's just -- oh, so in -- the people who used to go to lunch counters and wanted to just sit down, they didn't necessarily want to try the food there --<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: No, no.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Sonia Sotomayor: -- those people weren't discriminated against?<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G. Unikowsky: They were definitely discriminated against because they were prevented from sitting at the lunch counter. That's the discrimination.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Elena Kagan: Could I -- could I just go back to what you think would be enough? So, if a person said, I'm checking out -- I'm trying to find a fully accessible hotel in a -- a small, great beach town.<\/turn>\n<turn>Adam G.

But to answer your earlier question to my friend on the other side of the podium, Justice Kennedy, it would be difficult to imagine a circumstance in which this Court wouldn't say, well, you were wrong, Kansas, about the Eighth Amendment here, and therefore we're going to remand so you can resolve this issue about whether or not this is in fact a Kansas Supreme Court reading of the Kansas State law.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M.

It's simpler to prove A.<\/turn>\n<turn>William E. Marsh: Justice Breyer, in 2003, when Mr. Sykes was convicted of this offense, what you said is exactly right. Of course, we have no way of knowing the motivation of prosecutors generally, let alone in this case. And it really wouldn't matter what it was in this case, what it is generally. But I think it's significant that in 2006 the Indiana General Assembly amended that statute so now the (B) violation carries with it a mandatory jail sentence, 60 days.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Stephen G.

So he's entitled to both Montgomery and -- and Post-9\/11. You say but he has to choose, as though he's not allowed to cash in or take advantage of both.

And it was.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: All right. And this goes back to Justice Scalia's question.

But turning to the new evidence, there is a reason things like this happen. In California, the claim was denied without any hearing and without any explanation.

If you have a dispute about whether something is, in fact, arising under the agreement, in our view, that should go to the arbitrator by virtue of the incorporation.

These presumptions that we recognized in our case law you indicated had both a statutory and a common law basis. I'm -- I -- I -- I want to understand your statutory argument better because, for the moment, assume I'm -- I'm going to put the common law ones aside. You pointed us to Section 2, but Section 2 seems to suggest we follow normal contract rules in trying to discern the parties' intentions. What am I missing?<\/turn>\n<turn>Kannon K. Shanmugam: I don't think you're missing anything, Justice Gorsuch, because I really do think that the Court has never spoken to this. But I think, quite frankly, that the origins of what we refer to as the First Options presumption, but it really originates in the Court's labor cases, are -- are -- are, frankly, somewhat more nebulous. If you trace that back, it really traces back to a footnote in one of the Steelworkers cases that, in turn, relies on a law review article written by Dean Cox. Now there's no better person to have write a law review article than Dean Cox, but, ultimately, I think that that presumption just rests on a -- an empirical presumption that parties often don't focus on arbitrability. I think, by contrast, the presumption in favor of arbitration is a venerable one often reaffirmed and applied by this Court, and it's one that applies across the board. And, again, it simply reflects the strong federal policy in favor of arbitration.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: I -- I -- I -- I'm still waiting for a statutory argument, though. I get that there are venerable law review articles and -- and lots of statements in our cases, but is there indeed any statutory basis for any of these?<\/turn>\n<turn>Kannon K. Shanmugam: Well, I -- I -- I think I can't do really much better than Section 2. And as I acknowledged earlier, I think that there is, you know, some tension between the principle that applies according to its terms and the presumption in favor of arbitration. My point, Justice Gorsuch, is simply that all that the Court needs to do in this case is to apply the presumption in favor of arbitration to the delegation to rule in our favor. And what the Court shouldn't do is what Respondent suggests, which is to extend the First Options presumption beyond the context of whether or not there is a delegation to the scope of the delegation. The latter is a question of contract interpretation, and it should be governed by whatever the general rules are that govern the interpretation of arbitration agreements.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Thank you.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G.

Shanmugam: Correct.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Okay. And then your point is that the Fifth Circuit -- I think this is your argument -- confused the question of -- of arbitrability, namely, what subjects are decided by an arbitrator and what subjects are decided by a court -- confused that question with the question of who decides arbitrability, is that right?<\/turn>\n<turn>Kannon K.

But I think, quite frankly, that the origins of what we refer to as the First Options presumption, but it really originates in the Court's labor cases, are -- are -- are, frankly, somewhat more nebulous. If you trace that back, it really traces back to a footnote in one of the Steelworkers cases that, in turn, relies on a law review article written by Dean Cox. Now there's no better person to have write a law review article than Dean Cox, but, ultimately, I think that that presumption just rests on a -- an empirical presumption that parties often don't focus on arbitrability. I think, by contrast, the presumption in favor of arbitration is a venerable one often reaffirmed and applied by this Court, and it's one that applies across the board. And, again, it simply reflects the strong federal policy in favor of arbitration.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: I -- I -- I -- I'm still waiting for a statutory argument, though. I get that there are venerable law review articles and -- and lots of statements in our cases, but is there indeed any statutory basis for any of these?<\/turn>\n<turn>Kannon K. Shanmugam: Well, I -- I -- I think I can't do really much better than Section 2. And as I acknowledged earlier, I think that there is, you know, some tension between the principle that applies according to its terms and the presumption in favor of arbitration. My point, Justice Gorsuch, is simply that all that the Court needs to do in this case is to apply the presumption in favor of arbitration to the delegation to rule in our favor. And what the Court shouldn't do is what Respondent suggests, which is to extend the First Options presumption beyond the context of whether or not there is a delegation to the scope of the delegation. The latter is a question of contract interpretation, and it should be governed by whatever the general rules are that govern the interpretation of arbitration agreements.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Neil Gorsuch: Thank you.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Kavanaugh.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Shanmugam. I want to make sure I have the roadmap clear here with you. The premise of the case as you're presenting it to us is that this contract language expressly delegates the question of arbitrability to the arbitrator, correct?<\/turn>\n<turn>Kannon K. Shanmugam: Yes, that's right. Or by incorporation, to be sure, but that's right.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Yeah, by incorporation. And you -- you say if we want to figure out whether the AAA rules actually are an express delegation, we should grant cert on that question at some point and decide that, but, for here, we can assume express delegation, correct?<\/turn>\n<turn>Kannon K. Shanmugam: Correct.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Okay. And then your point is that the Fifth Circuit -- I think this is your argument -- confused the question of -- of arbitrability, namely, what subjects are decided by an arbitrator and what subjects are decided by a court -- confused that question with the question of who decides arbitrability, is that right?<\/turn>\n<turn>Kannon K.

Francisco: But that's only because it alleged conduct, malicious libel, that wasn't arguably protected. And, here, the government agrees with us that the conduct alleged in this complaint isn't arguably protected. The only issue is whether the Board's disagreement over what the actual facts are, as opposed to the alleged facts, changes that. That was the exact posture of Bill Johnson's, where the Board thought that the actual facts were different from the alleged facts. Yet, this Court nonetheless held that it was up to the state court to determine what the actual facts were, not the Board. That's all we're asking for here. And, again, I think it is a straightforward application of how preemption works in virtually every other context.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: Could a state court decide -- if this was sent back to them, could the state court say what Justice Sotomayor suggested, which is now that we have a pending complaint, we're going to step aside, either as a matter of abstention or whatever?<\/turn>\n<turn>Noel J.

We'd be -- we're talking about preemption here, meaning does the federal court -- or does the federal law preclude the state.

Francisco: Well, I -- I think I understand the question. And what I'm saying is, if you issue an opinion along the lines of what you said in Bill Johnson's and what you say is that where there's this factual dispute, the Board should stay its hand because it's up to the state court to determine what the facts are in the first instance, I don't think it would be up to the state court to say otherwise and to essentially thumb its nose at the Court's decision.

At the motion to dismiss, the court assesses the complaint, resolves the facts most favorably to the non-moving party, and then says, on those facts, is this conduct preempted? It either is or it isn't. Garmon takes it a step further. It moves that preemption analysis up not just to an actual conflict but also to an arguable conflict. That's Garmon's innovation. But I'm not aware of any case that has ever taken Garmon further than that and said that, in addition, we're depriving state courts of making the threshold factual determination in the first place.

Francisco: But that's only because it alleged conduct, malicious libel, that wasn't arguably protected. And, here, the government agrees with us that the conduct alleged in this complaint isn't arguably protected. The only issue is whether the Board's disagreement over what the actual facts are, as opposed to the alleged facts, changes that. That was the exact posture of Bill Johnson's, where the Board thought that the actual facts were different from the alleged facts. Yet, this Court nonetheless held that it was up to the state court to determine what the actual facts were, not the Board. That's all we're asking for here. And, again, I think it is a straightforward application of how preemption works in virtually every other context.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: Could a state court decide -- if this was sent back to them, could the state court say what Justice Sotomayor suggested, which is now that we have a pending complaint, we're going to step aside, either as a matter of abstention or whatever?<\/turn>\n<turn>Noel J. Francisco: Mm-hmm. Certainly not if you resolve this issue my way. And even if you just stay silent on it, I'll make the same argument anyhow.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: Why not?<\/turn>\n<turn>Noel J. Francisco: Because, as a matter of federal law, if this Court says that it's for the state court to decide and not the Board, I don't know how the state court could then say otherwise.<\/turn>\n<turn>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: That's not what we'd be saying. We'd be -- we're talking about preemption here, meaning does the federal court -- or does the federal law preclude the state. What I'm asking is, fine, we say -- even if we agree with you that Garmon preemption apply -- does not apply and, therefore, we return it to the state, could the state say, in light of the fact that the Board is now considering this, we are going to abstain?<\/turn>\n<turn>Noel J. Francisco: Well, I -- I think I understand the question. And what I'm saying is, if you issue an opinion along the lines of what you said in Bill Johnson's and what you say is that where there's this factual dispute, the Board should stay its hand because it's up to the state court to determine what the facts are in the first instance, I don't think it would be up to the state court to say otherwise and to essentially thumb its nose at the Court's decision.

But, as this Court indicated in Powell, nearly 50 years ago, nothing would be less fruitful than for this Court to select a rigid rule of constitutional law of insanity. And that admonition rings as true today as it did 50 years ago. The first thing I'd like to talk about is that it's not deeply rooted. The right versus wrong test is a relatively recent vintage. The historical basis for it started somewhere around the 1800s; and, therefore, it's not deeply rooted. In addition, the states have had historical and traditional discretion to both define the elements of the criminal law, the defenses that are available in those criminal justice proceedings, and the substantive rules at which those defenses and elements are met. And consistent with that discretion, the State of Kansas has a holistic approach to the mental illness problem starting at the time the criminal justice proceeding is initiated, throughout the guilt phase, as well as in the punishment phase, and continuing on even with regard to the sentence as it's carried out, whether being in a prison or in a mental hospital. These factors confirm that Petitioner has not carried the heavy burden to identify a single rule that is clearly established and required by the fundamental elements of due process. And for that reason, we believe that the state supreme court judgment in Kansas should be affirmed. And so unless there are additional questions this Court would have, I'd -- I'd like to first turn to the answer of Justice Alito's question, and the answer is the right-and-wrong test has multiple components.
