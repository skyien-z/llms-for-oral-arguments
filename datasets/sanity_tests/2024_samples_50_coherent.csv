2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?,"<speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The prevailing party is the party who wins the lawsuit, obtaining a final judgment in its favor, or at least a party who obtains a ruling that the defendant is liable on the merits of one or more claims, such as a summary judgment or a judgment as a matter of law. A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds. It provid es no enduring relief. By its nature, it is a temporary procedural order that dissolves upon final judgment. A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies. Legal dictionaries at the time Congress enacted Section 1988 defined  ""prevailing party"" based on whether the party had successfully maintained its claim, looking to the end of the suit, not on its degree of success at earlier stages. This Court's precedent similarly provides that liability for fees and liability on the merits go hand in hand. The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party.

The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party. I look forward to this Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You --can a consent decree or a default judgment support a prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang.

Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang.

2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?

A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds.

A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies.

Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief.

It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court.

So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG</text>",coherent
2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.","<speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The prevailing party is the party who wins the lawsuit, obtaining a final judgment in its favor, or at least a party who obtains a ruling that the defendant is liable on the merits of one or more claims, such as a summary judgment or a judgment as a matter of law. A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds. It provid es no enduring relief. By its nature, it is a temporary procedural order that dissolves upon final judgment. A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies. Legal dictionaries at the time Congress enacted Section 1988 defined  ""prevailing party"" based on whether the party had successfully maintained its claim, looking to the end of the suit, not on its degree of success at earlier stages. This Court's precedent similarly provides that liability for fees and liability on the merits go hand in hand. The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party. I look forward to this Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> We'll hear argument next in Case 23-621, Lackey versus Stinnie. Ms. Maley.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The prevailing party is the party who wins the lawsuit, obtaining a final judgment in its favor, or at least a party who obtains a ruling that the defendant is liable on the merits of one or more claims, such as a summary judgment or a judgment as a matter of law.

The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party. I look forward to this Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You --can a consent decree or a default judgment support a prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing.

And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify.

Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion.

If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang.

Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG</text>",coherent
2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?","<speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The prevailing party is the party who wins the lawsuit, obtaining a final judgment in its favor, or at least a party who obtains a ruling that the defendant is liable on the merits of one or more claims, such as a summary judgment or a judgment as a matter of law. A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds. It provid es no enduring relief. By its nature, it is a temporary procedural order that dissolves upon final judgment. A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies. Legal dictionaries at the time Congress enacted Section 1988 defined  ""prevailing party"" based on whether the party had successfully maintained its claim, looking to the end of the suit, not on its degree of success at earlier stages. This Court's precedent similarly provides that liability for fees and liability on the merits go hand in hand. The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party.

I look forward to this Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You --can a consent decree or a default judgment support a prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L.

And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G.

Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L.

I look forward to this Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You --can a consent decree or a default judgment support a prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L.

A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds. It provid es no enduring relief. By its nature, it is a temporary procedural order that dissolves upon final judgment. A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies. Legal dictionaries at the time Congress enacted Section 1988 defined  ""prevailing party"" based on whether the party had successfully maintained its claim, looking to the end of the suit, not on its degree of success at earlier stages. This Court's precedent similarly provides that liability for fees and liability on the merits go hand in hand. The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party. I look forward to this Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You --can a consent decree or a default judgment support a prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang.

Yang</speaker><text> No. No, I don't  --I don't. There's only one statute, by the way, that predates Section 1988. It's Section 1617, which is discussed by the Court in Bradley. All  that does is clarifies that you don't need a true final judgment that ends the case. A final judgment normally is one that resolves all  claims and ceases to terminate -- terminates the case. In the context of -- of Section 1617, that's in the context of school desegregation injunctive orders, and in that context, you often will have a final order, which is a  -- you know, even if it doesn't resolve all claims, but it's final, it's on the merits, you're granting relief on the merits, but the injunction may need to be tweaked as we go along because just any kind of complicated institutional injunction is going to have to be tweaked. That's all Section 1617 requires. It does not depart -- it does not change the normal understanding of ""prevailing party,"" which a prevailing party is one who succeeds at the end of the case because they obtain judgment on at least one claim.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counsel  --</text><speaker>John G.

Nothing you've done or someone else has done has changed it. You got all the relief you really wanted. I wanted to protest.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, you did not get relief on the merits. Now I think a lot of the questions have --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> We -- we keep going back to the operative question here, which is we repeatedly said you don't need a final judgment. You don't need a determination o f the merits. You can have a consent judgment. You can have this. There has to be  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> I don't think that's quite</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- a different sense.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- I don't think that's quite right. The legislative history says you don't need a final judgment following a full trial on the merits.

You get a judgment --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, summary judgment is a final judgment.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Not until you appeal it.

Correct. And I -- and I also want to address just a more general point, which is some of the questions were like:  Well, the fees have been incurred, we've got to allocate them. You know, who do  we allocate them to?  Well, that's answered by the American rule. The American rule is each party, win or lose, bears their own fees. And this Court has made clear that you need express statutory authority to depart from that rule. And the statutory --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --and isn't that the statute we're talking about here? Right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, the statute uses a term of art that's existed in statutes since at least -- the American statute since at least 1853.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but it is  -- it is addressing -- it is trying, Congress, to give us an exception to the American rule, and the question is what is the scope of that exception.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But Congress didn't go all the way. Congress adopted a term of art which had  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Prevailing party.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- a settled meaning.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask about Justice Gorsuch's example?  What if I don't want to spend the time and additional money to litigate this through to a declaratory judgment or a future?  What if I just want to march in  the parade tomorrow?  I'm a religious organization, for example. I don't  --you know, I agree with traditional marriage, and tomorrow is the LGBTQ parade and I want to march in it. I want to be able to be there. I  -- I'm not making a whole thing out of it.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I -- I get that. I go to court and I argue the merits of my entitlement  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to be able to do that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And the court says, as a preliminary matter, we don't have a whole trial yet, I think you're going to win, so I'm giving you an injunction and you get to march in the parade.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And I do.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then I'm done. I say the case is mooted because, really, the relief that I wanted was the ability to march in the parade tomorrow. But I did have to pay an attorney to be able to convince you, court, to give me the relief that I requested. I --I guess I don't understand why, under our formulation of the test for a prevailing party in the Lefemine case, what we say  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That was a permanent injunction, and --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand it was a permanent injunction in that case, but I'm asking you, we set up a test for when you are a prevailing party, and the question is why doesn't that test also cover preliminary injunctions like the one that I talked about.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Part of that test is a judgment on the merits, and a judge  -- this is not  -- a preliminary injunction is a tentative determination that does not control anything later in the suit. It's only for the PI stage,  only to adjust the parties' relationships during the suit.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Mr. Yang, does any  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And this is important.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Ms. Maley said that she didn't know of a circuit that it accept ed -- that had accepted this categorical position, if it's a preliminary injunction, there are no fees. Do you know of any circuit that's accepted this categorical position?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, that was the Smyth rule prior to.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Yeah, prior to it being changed, and  --and so now --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, but this Court granted cert on unanimous --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- so now there's -- there's a uniform rule. You don't know of anything  --any court that's gone the other way. You know what?  It's an interesting thing. It seems that this comes up all the time, and it seems as though it's come up frequently just in recent years. When I was talking to my clerks about this, you know, several had confronted this issue with respect to COVID litigation, where  people went to courts and they asked for injunctions from various kinds of COVID policies, and then, you know, in the end, those  policies were changed or were scrapped or were abandoned in some way. So it seems as though there's quite a lot of recent law that cuts against you here from circuits, like, pretty much all across the U.S.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the circuits are not uniform. Some of them look to -- for instance, the Fifth Circuit looks to why the -- the mooting event occurred, but my -- my point -- I want to make two points. One, this Court already addressed the strategic mootness question in Buckhannon and  -- and  -- and addressed that in four different factors. There's two other factors. I want to address two of those first and then I'll go to Buckhannon. One is that Congress has struck a balance here, that there is reason for caution before abandoning what this Court has described as the crucial connection between liability for a violation of federal law on the merits, finding on the merits that you violated federal law, and attorney's fees, and there's reason to -- to give pause before doing that. Congress has sometimes been more generous with the government, but these -- this case -- this statute covers both private individuals and non-federal actors. Secondly, going to Buckhannon, the cost  --there's a cost of deterring federal government action from being voluntarily changed when it may be lawful. Litigation often puts a spotlight on a practice that might not be the best policy even though it's lawful, and the Court in Buckhannon recognized there is a cost to deterring that kind of good government change. Secondly --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Okay. I don't think that that's what I was asking about. I was asking really, you know, do you have any law out there on your side?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> We have a term of art that has gone back --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, what  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- in this Court's decisions, and -- and I think that the courts of appeals just have not been faithful to this Court's decisions.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, that  -- that raises the question for me, why -- why do you think they've been not seeing the light?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, I think sometimes there's  -- as a policy matter, you might decide, hey, you know, this  -- this --I don't like this outcome. I think some of the courts  -- and -- and I acknowledge that there might be some cases like that. But that type of policy call is for Congress to make. So, in Buckhannon, when the Court rejected the catalyst theory, Justice Ginsburg dissented and said:  Hey, look, there's one specific area that's really problematic, FOIA. Congress reacted and did a targeted response to This really goes to the appropriate separation of powers here. Congress adopts a  statute that has a term of art that goes back quite some time. This Court has repeatedly  determined that merits determination, you know, a determination of liability on the merits is crucial to then make  --making the defendant liable for fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Congress --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> The Respondents argue that there is a historical background of a venerable equitable tradition of awarding interim costs, including for a preliminary injunction, and that, if accepted, would perhaps undercut your historical argument. Do you want to say something about that?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> There's two points I would love to make about that. First, this -- this Court already resolved that argument in Alyeska Pipeline. There was a  --and it was actually Justice Marshall's dissent, which was based on equitable principles. What the Court decided in Alyeska Pipeline is that the American rule is each party bears its own costs. There are certain discrete common law exceptions that have evolved. At equity, for instance, the common fund exception,  you get a fund. It would be unjustly  -- you would unjustly enrich the people who benefit unless they pay your fees. That's a fee-sharing, not fee-shifting. Bad faith attorney's fees is another one. Contempt fees is another exception. But the Court did not say equity, you know, it's all -- you know, whatever you think is equitable. The Court recognized that there are very discrete limits. And I think that's illustrated by the only case that they cite, the only case that they cite as  --as supporting a PI fee award, and that's Clancy versus Geb. In that case, it was not based on the temporary injunction that was issued on the day the suit was filed. The court said it was based on the trial on the merits that sustained the cause of action for an injunction. Now, after the trial on the merits, the court didn't grant further injunctive relief, and that might be a problem, but it certainly does not  stand for the proposition that a TRO or, you know -- or a PI gets you prevailing party status. There was a final adjudication on the merits of the -- of the cause of action.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Just to be clear, Buckhannon, there was no court -ordered relief whatsoever, correct?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's true. That's true.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as I read the decision, that was mostly the focus of the decision?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, certainly, the catalyst theory was  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It was the prime focus.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- but the catalyst --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- theory does not -- we're not escaping the catalyst theory here because  the catalyst theory is embedded in this case. It is the second -- it is what happened with this case after --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you're  -- you're -- you're claiming there is no catalyst theory because you're saying the legislature acted -- or the other side is saying it acted independently, so it -- it has nothing to do --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the catalyst theory was rejected in Buckhannon.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> They're saying it doesn't matter why the case ends. It just ended with a judgment, dismissal of the action. It could be for mootness. It could be because the other side gave up. I got what I came for at least in part. I got my license back. I drove for 16 months. I didn't have to pay anybody to get my license back. I won for those  --that part of my relief. And it's never been dissolved, reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But that's not what the term ""prevailing party"" has been understood, either by this Court or by the dictionary definitions that date back from before the -- the  -- the 20th Century. That has required a final adjudication  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well, that's the problem. No, it's never required a final adjudication. It's required a judgment but not a final one.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it has. I mean, even  --even the legislative history -- this Court in Hanrahan discussed the legislative history. It's all in dicta, but it discussed the legislative history of Section 1988, and what  --the conclusion the Court drew was that interim fees, meaning before the case is finally over, only -- were available only when the party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of its claims. And that happens when you get a final determination, maybe not a final judgment because you're not resolving all claims or maybe because there's some ongoing litigation about the nature of the injunctive relief.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Yang. We -- we have a difference of opinion on what finality means. If all you're seeking  is a preliminary injunction, that's final for that purpose.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> You don't  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That  -- that's the problem we're having.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --file suits for preliminary injunctions. You file suits for  equitable relief, a judgment at the end of the suit. A preliminary injunction is a preliminary matter that protects the parties while the suit is adjudicated.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Let me see if I've got it. So a PI can't be the basis for a  --a -- an award of fees under this statute because Sole basically says you have to look at what happens afterwards. And for all the reasons you just gave, a PI is a PI. It's preliminary. It's not  --okay. All right. Fine. Now  -- so we have to look what happened afterwards. And, here, what happened afterwards is plaintiffs may well have convinced  the Virginia state legislature to change their mind in a catalyst sort of way.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> The problem is Buckhannon says that doesn't work either.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. But Justice Ginsburg in Buckhannon says, hey, Congress should fix that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And Congress did fix it in FOIA --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yep.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and said involuntary  -- voluntary cessation and changes, you still get fees. But --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So long as it's not an insubstantial claim.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So quite generous, with the government's money, of course. You know, it's quite different when we're talking about privat e litigants and non-federal. I think Congress might be more reticent to creating such a generous departure from even the prevailing party standard, but it could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And it hasn't here.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> End of case. That's your theory of the case?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's our theory.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. Got it.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I think, when the red light went on, you were in the middle of a really brilliant answer about Buckhannon. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And do you want to finish that answer?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Like a  --like a preliminary injunction, it was fleeting. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And I'm not sure that I recall the brilliance that was --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, I will look at the transcript and fill it in, so okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the  -- you know, I was just going to try to talk about strategic mootness maybe a little bit. Maybe that's where  we were going. And, you know --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Sure.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- strategic mootness, as my  -- my  --my colleague has already answered, you've got a voluntary cessation barrier, which, you know, in your decision in Fikre, Justice Gorsuch, it's a pretty formidable burden.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I hope so. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it -- it's a formidable burden. Damages awards, never going to moot out. And it's entirely speculative what effect this is going to have. That's what Buckhannon said. Like, it's not speculative whether it's going to deter counsel or not. And I think this illustrates that. There's no data to show this. This case was started when Smyth was the rule. They had no reason to expect any attorney's fees from a PI, but they took the case. So it's a little hard to say, like, there's this compelling case that, like, we're going to have a  -- a --a crash in civil rights, civil rights era. And there's a real cost, again, to determining  -- to deterring the government from changing course when the action might be lawful but bad policy.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. That's good enough. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So here's the problem that I'm having with your statement of the case as you summarized with Justice Gorsuch. It's that it begins with Sole says that a PI doesn't count because you have to look at what happens afterwards. I'm reading from Sole. ""We express no view on whether, in the absence of a final decision on the merits of a claim for permanent relief, success in gaining a preliminary injunction may sometimes warrant an award of counsel fees.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So I don't know how you can start your case with the premise that Sole stands for the proposition that if you win a preliminary injunction, you have to get to final judgment in order to be entitled to  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it's true  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- counsel fees.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --that the Court reserved that, but the Court also did say that it recognized that a preliminary injunction was just the initial salvo. As I stated in my intro, it's  -- the tentative character makes a fee request at that initial stage premature.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It did not say ""premature.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It says, ""Wyner is not a prevailing party, we conclude, for her initial victory was ephemeral.""  And it was ephemeral in that case because it happened to go on and get reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It's on page 84 of the Court's opinion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> ""The tentative  character would have made the fee request at this initial stage premature.""</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> ""The tentative character"" --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Of the PI.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- ""would have made"" -- yes, but it also says:  ""We express no view as to whether or not that tentative character in  PI is enough to make you a prevailing party.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Agreed, but I think it goes halfway there, and Buckhannon closes the door on that  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- because --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>Anthony A.

Yang</speaker><text> No. No, I don't  --I don't. There's only one statute, by the way, that predates Section 1988. It's Section 1617, which is discussed by the Court in Bradley. All  that does is clarifies that you don't need a true final judgment that ends the case. A final judgment normally is one that resolves all  claims and ceases to terminate -- terminates the case. In the context of -- of Section 1617, that's in the context of school desegregation injunctive orders, and in that context, you often will have a final order, which is a  -- you know, even if it doesn't resolve all claims, but it's final, it's on the merits, you're granting relief on the merits, but the injunction may need to be tweaked as we go along because just any kind of complicated institutional injunction is going to have to be tweaked. That's all Section 1617 requires. It does not depart -- it does not change the normal understanding of ""prevailing party,"" which a prevailing party is one who succeeds at the end of the case because they obtain judgment on at least one claim.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counsel  --</text><speaker>John G.

Now, if you prevail on  one, can you get the attorney fees that are associated with 2, 3, and 4?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No. The question -- there's multiple questions in attorney's fees cases. The first is whether you're a prevailing party. You have to succeed on at least one claim on the merits to be prevailing.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> The question then goes to how much fees. That's a  --usually, it's a reasonable fee award. And the reasonableness of the fees, you -- you would look more granularly to determine whether the case -- the issues were intertwined or not. If they're completely separate issues and you lost on them, generally, no, you don't get fees for those.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> What do you do with the case that Justice Jackson posed, which is common?  I want to -- I want to participate in this protest, this parade  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and only the passage of time moots the case. You've gotten all your relief. Nothing you've done or someone else has done has changed it. You got all the relief you really wanted. I wanted to protest.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, you did not get relief on the merits. Now I think a lot of the questions have --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> We -- we keep going back to the operative question here, which is we repeatedly said you don't need a final judgment. You don't need a determination o f the merits. You can have a consent judgment. You can have this. There has to be  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> I don't think that's quite</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- a different sense.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- I don't think that's quite right. The legislative history says you don't need a final judgment following a full trial on the merits. That means you can get a final judgment at an earlier stage through summary judgment before you go to trial, through, for instance, a  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's not a final judgment. You get a judgment --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, summary judgment is a final judgment.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Not until you appeal it. Not until the whole case is litigated. You get a judgment but not final judgment.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> If sum  --if the court grants summary judgment, it is a final judgment if it's on all the claims.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's the  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> If it's summary judgment on part of the claims, then it's subject to revision, so it's not truly final. If it's  -- if it's injunctive and you grant summary judgment and then award injunctive relief, well, that's final because you're actually awarding merits relief at that point.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So, for example, the Chief -- Chief Justice's hypothetical, after the parade, I could ask for a trial on the merits in -- in accompanying the PI and a final judgment could be issued at that time?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That happens all the time. It happens from --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It happens  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And  --and --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- but sometimes it doesn't because it's the court --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and sometimes it doesn't because I might want to go ahead and litigate it because I'm concerned about the same thing in the future and I might want, for example, a declaratory judgment, and I -- I could issue  -- I could --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Or the parade may be annual.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It may be annual.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> A lot of these parades are annual parades.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And I want a prospective injunction going forward.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And then we would have a final judgment on the merits  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- on at least that claim on which you would be prevailing, right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct. Correct. And I -- and I also want to address just a more general point, which is some of the questions were like:  Well, the fees have been incurred, we've got to allocate them. You know, who do  we allocate them to?  Well, that's answered by the American rule. The American rule is each party, win or lose, bears their own fees. And this Court has made clear that you need express statutory authority to depart from that rule. And the statutory --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --and isn't that the statute we're talking about here? Right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, the statute uses a term of art that's existed in statutes since at least -- the American statute since at least 1853.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but it is  -- it is addressing -- it is trying, Congress, to give us an exception to the American rule, and the question is what is the scope of that exception.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But Congress didn't go all the way. Congress adopted a term of art which had  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Prevailing party.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- a settled meaning.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask about Justice Gorsuch's example?  What if I don't want to spend the time and additional money to litigate this through to a declaratory judgment or a future?  What if I just want to march in  the parade tomorrow?  I'm a religious organization, for example. I don't  --you know, I agree with traditional marriage, and tomorrow is the LGBTQ parade and I want to march in it. I want to be able to be there. I  -- I'm not making a whole thing out of it.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I -- I get that. I go to court and I argue the merits of my entitlement  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to be able to do that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And the court says, as a preliminary matter, we don't have a whole trial yet, I think you're going to win, so I'm giving you an injunction and you get to march in the parade.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And I do.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then I'm done. I say the case is mooted because, really, the relief that I wanted was the ability to march in the parade tomorrow. But I did have to pay an attorney to be able to convince you, court, to give me the relief that I requested. I --I guess I don't understand why, under our formulation of the test for a prevailing party in the Lefemine case, what we say  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That was a permanent injunction, and --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand it was a permanent injunction in that case, but I'm asking you, we set up a test for when you are a prevailing party, and the question is why doesn't that test also cover preliminary injunctions like the one that I talked about.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Part of that test is a judgment on the merits, and a judge  -- this is not  -- a preliminary injunction is a tentative determination that does not control anything later in the suit. It's only for the PI stage,  only to adjust the parties' relationships during the suit.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Mr. Yang, does any  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And this is important.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Ms. Maley said that she didn't know of a circuit that it accept ed -- that had accepted this categorical position, if it's a preliminary injunction, there are no fees. Do you know of any circuit that's accepted this categorical position?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, that was the Smyth rule prior to.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Yeah, prior to it being changed, and  --and so now --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, but this Court granted cert on unanimous --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- so now there's -- there's a uniform rule. You don't know of anything  --any court that's gone the other way. You know what?  It's an interesting thing. It seems that this comes up all the time, and it seems as though it's come up frequently just in recent years. When I was talking to my clerks about this, you know, several had confronted this issue with respect to COVID litigation, where  people went to courts and they asked for injunctions from various kinds of COVID policies, and then, you know, in the end, those  policies were changed or were scrapped or were abandoned in some way. So it seems as though there's quite a lot of recent law that cuts against you here from circuits, like, pretty much all across the U.S.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the circuits are not uniform. Some of them look to -- for instance, the Fifth Circuit looks to why the -- the mooting event occurred, but my -- my point -- I want to make two points. One, this Court already addressed the strategic mootness question in Buckhannon and  -- and  -- and addressed that in four different factors. There's two other factors. I want to address two of those first and then I'll go to Buckhannon. One is that Congress has struck a balance here, that there is reason for caution before abandoning what this Court has described as the crucial connection between liability for a violation of federal law on the merits, finding on the merits that you violated federal law, and attorney's fees, and there's reason to -- to give pause before doing that. Congress has sometimes been more generous with the government, but these -- this case -- this statute covers both private individuals and non-federal actors. Secondly, going to Buckhannon, the cost  --there's a cost of deterring federal government action from being voluntarily changed when it may be lawful. Litigation often puts a spotlight on a practice that might not be the best policy even though it's lawful, and the Court in Buckhannon recognized there is a cost to deterring that kind of good government change. Secondly --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Okay. I don't think that that's what I was asking about. I was asking really, you know, do you have any law out there on your side?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> We have a term of art that has gone back --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, what  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- in this Court's decisions, and -- and I think that the courts of appeals just have not been faithful to this Court's decisions.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, that  -- that raises the question for me, why -- why do you think they've been not seeing the light?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, I think sometimes there's  -- as a policy matter, you might decide, hey, you know, this  -- this --I don't like this outcome. I think some of the courts  -- and -- and I acknowledge that there might be some cases like that. But that type of policy call is for Congress to make. So, in Buckhannon, when the Court rejected the catalyst theory, Justice Ginsburg dissented and said:  Hey, look, there's one specific area that's really problematic, FOIA. Congress reacted and did a targeted response to This really goes to the appropriate separation of powers here. Congress adopts a  statute that has a term of art that goes back quite some time. This Court has repeatedly  determined that merits determination, you know, a determination of liability on the merits is crucial to then make  --making the defendant liable for fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Congress --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> The Respondents argue that there is a historical background of a venerable equitable tradition of awarding interim costs, including for a preliminary injunction, and that, if accepted, would perhaps undercut your historical argument. Do you want to say something about that?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> There's two points I would love to make about that. First, this -- this Court already resolved that argument in Alyeska Pipeline. There was a  --and it was actually Justice Marshall's dissent, which was based on equitable principles. What the Court decided in Alyeska Pipeline is that the American rule is each party bears its own costs. There are certain discrete common law exceptions that have evolved. At equity, for instance, the common fund exception,  you get a fund. It would be unjustly  -- you would unjustly enrich the people who benefit unless they pay your fees. That's a fee-sharing, not fee-shifting. Bad faith attorney's fees is another one. Contempt fees is another exception. But the Court did not say equity, you know, it's all -- you know, whatever you think is equitable. The Court recognized that there are very discrete limits. And I think that's illustrated by the only case that they cite, the only case that they cite as  --as supporting a PI fee award, and that's Clancy versus Geb. In that case, it was not based on the temporary injunction that was issued on the day the suit was filed. The court said it was based on the trial on the merits that sustained the cause of action for an injunction. Now, after the trial on the merits, the court didn't grant further injunctive relief, and that might be a problem, but it certainly does not  stand for the proposition that a TRO or, you know -- or a PI gets you prevailing party status. There was a final adjudication on the merits of the -- of the cause of action.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Just to be clear, Buckhannon, there was no court -ordered relief whatsoever, correct?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's true. That's true.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as I read the decision, that was mostly the focus of the decision?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, certainly, the catalyst theory was  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It was the prime focus.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- but the catalyst --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- theory does not -- we're not escaping the catalyst theory here because  the catalyst theory is embedded in this case. It is the second -- it is what happened with this case after --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you're  -- you're -- you're claiming there is no catalyst theory because you're saying the legislature acted -- or the other side is saying it acted independently, so it -- it has nothing to do --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the catalyst theory was rejected in Buckhannon.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> They're saying it doesn't matter why the case ends. It just ended with a judgment, dismissal of the action. It could be for mootness. It could be because the other side gave up. I got what I came for at least in part. I got my license back. I drove for 16 months. I didn't have to pay anybody to get my license back. I won for those  --that part of my relief. And it's never been dissolved, reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But that's not what the term ""prevailing party"" has been understood, either by this Court or by the dictionary definitions that date back from before the -- the  -- the 20th Century. That has required a final adjudication  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well, that's the problem. No, it's never required a final adjudication. It's required a judgment but not a final one.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it has. I mean, even  --even the legislative history -- this Court in Hanrahan discussed the legislative history. It's all in dicta, but it discussed the legislative history of Section 1988, and what  --the conclusion the Court drew was that interim fees, meaning before the case is finally over, only -- were available only when the party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of its claims. And that happens when you get a final determination, maybe not a final judgment because you're not resolving all claims or maybe because there's some ongoing litigation about the nature of the injunctive relief.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Yang. We -- we have a difference of opinion on what finality means. If all you're seeking  is a preliminary injunction, that's final for that purpose.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> You don't  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That  -- that's the problem we're having.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --file suits for preliminary injunctions. You file suits for  equitable relief, a judgment at the end of the suit. A preliminary injunction is a preliminary matter that protects the parties while the suit is adjudicated.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Let me see if I've got it. So a PI can't be the basis for a  --a -- an award of fees under this statute because Sole basically says you have to look at what happens afterwards. And for all the reasons you just gave, a PI is a PI. It's preliminary. It's not  --okay. All right. Fine. Now  -- so we have to look what happened afterwards. And, here, what happened afterwards is plaintiffs may well have convinced  the Virginia state legislature to change their mind in a catalyst sort of way.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> The problem is Buckhannon says that doesn't work either.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. But Justice Ginsburg in Buckhannon says, hey, Congress should fix that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And Congress did fix it in FOIA --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yep.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and said involuntary  -- voluntary cessation and changes, you still get fees. But --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So long as it's not an insubstantial claim.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So quite generous, with the government's money, of course. You know, it's quite different when we're talking about privat e litigants and non-federal. I think Congress might be more reticent to creating such a generous departure from even the prevailing party standard, but it could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And it hasn't here.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> End of case. That's your theory of the case?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's our theory.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. Got it.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I think, when the red light went on, you were in the middle of a really brilliant answer about Buckhannon. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And do you want to finish that answer?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Like a  --like a preliminary injunction, it was fleeting. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And I'm not sure that I recall the brilliance that was --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, I will look at the transcript and fill it in, so okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the  -- you know, I was just going to try to talk about strategic mootness maybe a little bit. Maybe that's where  we were going. And, you know --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Sure.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- strategic mootness, as my  -- my  --my colleague has already answered, you've got a voluntary cessation barrier, which, you know, in your decision in Fikre, Justice Gorsuch, it's a pretty formidable burden.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I hope so. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it -- it's a formidable burden. Damages awards, never going to moot out. And it's entirely speculative what effect this is going to have. That's what Buckhannon said. Like, it's not speculative whether it's going to deter counsel or not. And I think this illustrates that. There's no data to show this. This case was started when Smyth was the rule. They had no reason to expect any attorney's fees from a PI, but they took the case. So it's a little hard to say, like, there's this compelling case that, like, we're going to have a  -- a --a crash in civil rights, civil rights era. And there's a real cost, again, to determining  -- to deterring the government from changing course when the action might be lawful but bad policy.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. That's good enough. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So here's the problem that I'm having with your statement of the case as you summarized with Justice Gorsuch. It's that it begins with Sole says that a PI doesn't count because you have to look at what happens afterwards. I'm reading from Sole. ""We express no view on whether, in the absence of a final decision on the merits of a claim for permanent relief, success in gaining a preliminary injunction may sometimes warrant an award of counsel fees.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So I don't know how you can start your case with the premise that Sole stands for the proposition that if you win a preliminary injunction, you have to get to final judgment in order to be entitled to  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it's true  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- counsel fees.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --that the Court reserved that, but the Court also did say that it recognized that a preliminary injunction was just the initial salvo. As I stated in my intro, it's  -- the tentative character makes a fee request at that initial stage premature.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It did not say ""premature.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It says, ""Wyner is not a prevailing party, we conclude, for her initial victory was ephemeral.""  And it was ephemeral in that case because it happened to go on and get reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It's on page 84 of the Court's opinion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> ""The tentative  character would have made the fee request at this initial stage premature.""</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> ""The tentative character"" --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Of the PI.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- ""would have made"" -- yes, but it also says:  ""We express no view as to whether or not that tentative character in  PI is enough to make you a prevailing party.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Agreed, but I think it goes halfway there, and Buckhannon closes the door on that  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- because --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>Anthony A.

2024.23-621-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," -- on at least that claim on which you would be prevailing, right?","<speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  ""Prevailing party"" is a longstanding term of art that means the party for whom judgment is entered, which turns on whether, at the end of the suit, the plaintiff has successfully maintained at least one claim for relief.

A preliminary injunction reflects a preliminary determination, not a final  determination, that rests on a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits, not actual success on those merits. Sole versus Wyner thus determined that a preliminary injunction's  tentative character makes a fee request at that preliminary initial stage premature. And after that, in this case, the case became moot due to legislative action that Buckhannon teaches does not confer prevailing party status.

I welcome the Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>Anthony A.

Yang</speaker><text> No. No, I don't  --I don't. There's only one statute, by the way, that predates Section 1988. It's Section 1617, which is discussed by the Court in Bradley. All  that does is clarifies that you don't need a true final judgment that ends the case. A final judgment normally is one that resolves all  claims and ceases to terminate -- terminates the case. In the context of -- of Section 1617, that's in the context of school desegregation injunctive orders, and in that context, you often will have a final order, which is a  -- you know, even if it doesn't resolve all claims, but it's final, it's on the merits, you're granting relief on the merits, but the injunction may need to be tweaked as we go along because just any kind of complicated institutional injunction is going to have to be tweaked. That's all Section 1617 requires. It does not depart -- it does not change the normal understanding of ""prevailing party,"" which a prevailing party is one who succeeds at the end of the case because they obtain judgment on at least one claim.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counsel  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say, if I understand it, you don't have to get final judgment on all the claims, right?  You just need to prevail on one. Now, if you prevail on  one, can you get the attorney fees that are associated with 2, 3, and 4?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No. The question -- there's multiple questions in attorney's fees cases. The first is whether you're a prevailing party. You have to succeed on at least one claim on the merits to be prevailing.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> The question then goes to how much fees. That's a  --usually, it's a reasonable fee award. And the reasonableness of the fees, you -- you would look more granularly to determine whether the case -- the issues were intertwined or not. If they're completely separate issues and you lost on them, generally, no, you don't get fees for those.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> What do you do with the case that Justice Jackson posed, which is common?  I want to -- I want to participate in this protest, this parade  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and only the passage of time moots the case. You've gotten all your relief. Nothing you've done or someone else has done has changed it. You got all the relief you really wanted. I wanted to protest.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, you did not get relief on the merits. Now I think a lot of the questions have --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> We -- we keep going back to the operative question here, which is we repeatedly said you don't need a final judgment. You don't need a determination o f the merits. You can have a consent judgment. You can have this. There has to be  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> I don't think that's quite</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- a different sense.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- I don't think that's quite right. The legislative history says you don't need a final judgment following a full trial on the merits. That means you can get a final judgment at an earlier stage through summary judgment before you go to trial, through, for instance, a  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's not a final judgment. You get a judgment --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, summary judgment is a final judgment.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Not until you appeal it. Not until the whole case is litigated. You get a judgment but not final judgment.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> If sum  --if the court grants summary judgment, it is a final judgment if it's on all the claims.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's the  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> If it's summary judgment on part of the claims, then it's subject to revision, so it's not truly final. If it's  -- if it's injunctive and you grant summary judgment and then award injunctive relief, well, that's final because you're actually awarding merits relief at that point.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So, for example, the Chief -- Chief Justice's hypothetical, after the parade, I could ask for a trial on the merits in -- in accompanying the PI and a final judgment could be issued at that time?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That happens all the time. It happens from --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It happens  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And  --and --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- but sometimes it doesn't because it's the court --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and sometimes it doesn't because I might want to go ahead and litigate it because I'm concerned about the same thing in the future and I might want, for example, a declaratory judgment, and I -- I could issue  -- I could --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Or the parade may be annual.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It may be annual.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> A lot of these parades are annual parades.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And I want a prospective injunction going forward.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And then we would have a final judgment on the merits  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- on at least that claim on which you would be prevailing, right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct. Correct. And I -- and I also want to address just a more general point, which is some of the questions were like:  Well, the fees have been incurred, we've got to allocate them. You know, who do  we allocate them to?  Well, that's answered by the American rule. The American rule is each party, win or lose, bears their own fees. And this Court has made clear that you need express statutory authority to depart from that rule. And the statutory --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --and isn't that the statute we're talking about here? Right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, the statute uses a term of art that's existed in statutes since at least -- the American statute since at least 1853.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but it is  -- it is addressing -- it is trying, Congress, to give us an exception to the American rule, and the question is what is the scope of that exception.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But Congress didn't go all the way. Congress adopted a term of art which had  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Prevailing party.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- a settled meaning.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask about Justice Gorsuch's example?  What if I don't want to spend the time and additional money to litigate this through to a declaratory judgment or a future?  What if I just want to march in  the parade tomorrow?  I'm a religious organization, for example. I don't  --you know, I agree with traditional marriage, and tomorrow is the LGBTQ parade and I want to march in it. I want to be able to be there. I  -- I'm not making a whole thing out of it.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I -- I get that. I go to court and I argue the merits of my entitlement  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to be able to do that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And the court says, as a preliminary matter, we don't have a whole trial yet, I think you're going to win, so I'm giving you an injunction and you get to march in the parade.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And I do.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then I'm done. I say the case is mooted because, really, the relief that I wanted was the ability to march in the parade tomorrow. But I did have to pay an attorney to be able to convince you, court, to give me the relief that I requested. I --I guess I don't understand why, under our formulation of the test for a prevailing party in the Lefemine case, what we say  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That was a permanent injunction, and --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand it was a permanent injunction in that case, but I'm asking you, we set up a test for when you are a prevailing party, and the question is why doesn't that test also cover preliminary injunctions like the one that I talked about.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Part of that test is a judgment on the merits, and a judge  -- this is not  -- a preliminary injunction is a tentative determination that does not control anything later in the suit. It's only for the PI stage,  only to adjust the parties' relationships during the suit.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Mr. Yang, does any  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And this is important.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Ms. Maley said that she didn't know of a circuit that it accept ed -- that had accepted this categorical position, if it's a preliminary injunction, there are no fees. Do you know of any circuit that's accepted this categorical position?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, that was the Smyth rule prior to.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Yeah, prior to it being changed, and  --and so now --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, but this Court granted cert on unanimous --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- so now there's -- there's a uniform rule. You don't know of anything  --any court that's gone the other way. You know what?  It's an interesting thing. It seems that this comes up all the time, and it seems as though it's come up frequently just in recent years. When I was talking to my clerks about this, you know, several had confronted this issue with respect to COVID litigation, where  people went to courts and they asked for injunctions from various kinds of COVID policies, and then, you know, in the end, those  policies were changed or were scrapped or were abandoned in some way. So it seems as though there's quite a lot of recent law that cuts against you here from circuits, like, pretty much all across the U.S.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the circuits are not uniform. Some of them look to -- for instance, the Fifth Circuit looks to why the -- the mooting event occurred, but my -- my point -- I want to make two points. One, this Court already addressed the strategic mootness question in Buckhannon and  -- and  -- and addressed that in four different factors. There's two other factors. I want to address two of those first and then I'll go to Buckhannon. One is that Congress has struck a balance here, that there is reason for caution before abandoning what this Court has described as the crucial connection between liability for a violation of federal law on the merits, finding on the merits that you violated federal law, and attorney's fees, and there's reason to -- to give pause before doing that. Congress has sometimes been more generous with the government, but these -- this case -- this statute covers both private individuals and non-federal actors. Secondly, going to Buckhannon, the cost  --there's a cost of deterring federal government action from being voluntarily changed when it may be lawful. Litigation often puts a spotlight on a practice that might not be the best policy even though it's lawful, and the Court in Buckhannon recognized there is a cost to deterring that kind of good government change. Secondly --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Okay. I don't think that that's what I was asking about. I was asking really, you know, do you have any law out there on your side?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> We have a term of art that has gone back --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, what  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- in this Court's decisions, and -- and I think that the courts of appeals just have not been faithful to this Court's decisions.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, that  -- that raises the question for me, why -- why do you think they've been not seeing the light?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, I think sometimes there's  -- as a policy matter, you might decide, hey, you know, this  -- this --I don't like this outcome. I think some of the courts  -- and -- and I acknowledge that there might be some cases like that. But that type of policy call is for Congress to make. So, in Buckhannon, when the Court rejected the catalyst theory, Justice Ginsburg dissented and said:  Hey, look, there's one specific area that's really problematic, FOIA. Congress reacted and did a targeted response to This really goes to the appropriate separation of powers here. Congress adopts a  statute that has a term of art that goes back quite some time. This Court has repeatedly  determined that merits determination, you know, a determination of liability on the merits is crucial to then make  --making the defendant liable for fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Congress --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> The Respondents argue that there is a historical background of a venerable equitable tradition of awarding interim costs, including for a preliminary injunction, and that, if accepted, would perhaps undercut your historical argument. Do you want to say something about that?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> There's two points I would love to make about that. First, this -- this Court already resolved that argument in Alyeska Pipeline. There was a  --and it was actually Justice Marshall's dissent, which was based on equitable principles. What the Court decided in Alyeska Pipeline is that the American rule is each party bears its own costs. There are certain discrete common law exceptions that have evolved. At equity, for instance, the common fund exception,  you get a fund. It would be unjustly  -- you would unjustly enrich the people who benefit unless they pay your fees. That's a fee-sharing, not fee-shifting. Bad faith attorney's fees is another one. Contempt fees is another exception. But the Court did not say equity, you know, it's all -- you know, whatever you think is equitable. The Court recognized that there are very discrete limits. And I think that's illustrated by the only case that they cite, the only case that they cite as  --as supporting a PI fee award, and that's Clancy versus Geb. In that case, it was not based on the temporary injunction that was issued on the day the suit was filed. The court said it was based on the trial on the merits that sustained the cause of action for an injunction. Now, after the trial on the merits, the court didn't grant further injunctive relief, and that might be a problem, but it certainly does not  stand for the proposition that a TRO or, you know -- or a PI gets you prevailing party status. There was a final adjudication on the merits of the -- of the cause of action.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Just to be clear, Buckhannon, there was no court -ordered relief whatsoever, correct?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's true. That's true.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as I read the decision, that was mostly the focus of the decision?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, certainly, the catalyst theory was  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It was the prime focus.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- but the catalyst --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- theory does not -- we're not escaping the catalyst theory here because  the catalyst theory is embedded in this case. It is the second -- it is what happened with this case after --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you're  -- you're -- you're claiming there is no catalyst theory because you're saying the legislature acted -- or the other side is saying it acted independently, so it -- it has nothing to do --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the catalyst theory was rejected in Buckhannon.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> They're saying it doesn't matter why the case ends. It just ended with a judgment, dismissal of the action. It could be for mootness. It could be because the other side gave up. I got what I came for at least in part. I got my license back. I drove for 16 months. I didn't have to pay anybody to get my license back. I won for those  --that part of my relief. And it's never been dissolved, reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But that's not what the term ""prevailing party"" has been understood, either by this Court or by the dictionary definitions that date back from before the -- the  -- the 20th Century. That has required a final adjudication  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well, that's the problem. No, it's never required a final adjudication. It's required a judgment but not a final one.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it has. I mean, even  --even the legislative history -- this Court in Hanrahan discussed the legislative history. It's all in dicta, but it discussed the legislative history of Section 1988, and what  --the conclusion the Court drew was that interim fees, meaning before the case is finally over, only -- were available only when the party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of its claims. And that happens when you get a final determination, maybe not a final judgment because you're not resolving all claims or maybe because there's some ongoing litigation about the nature of the injunctive relief.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Yang. We -- we have a difference of opinion on what finality means. If all you're seeking  is a preliminary injunction, that's final for that purpose.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> You don't  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That  -- that's the problem we're having.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --file suits for preliminary injunctions. You file suits for  equitable relief, a judgment at the end of the suit. A preliminary injunction is a preliminary matter that protects the parties while the suit is adjudicated.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Let me see if I've got it. So a PI can't be the basis for a  --a -- an award of fees under this statute because Sole basically says you have to look at what happens afterwards. And for all the reasons you just gave, a PI is a PI. It's preliminary. It's not  --okay. All right. Fine. Now  -- so we have to look what happened afterwards. And, here, what happened afterwards is plaintiffs may well have convinced  the Virginia state legislature to change their mind in a catalyst sort of way.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> The problem is Buckhannon says that doesn't work either.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. But Justice Ginsburg in Buckhannon says, hey, Congress should fix that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And Congress did fix it in FOIA --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yep.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and said involuntary  -- voluntary cessation and changes, you still get fees. But --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So long as it's not an insubstantial claim.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So quite generous, with the government's money, of course. You know, it's quite different when we're talking about privat e litigants and non-federal. I think Congress might be more reticent to creating such a generous departure from even the prevailing party standard, but it could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And it hasn't here.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> End of case. That's your theory of the case?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's our theory.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. Got it.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I think, when the red light went on, you were in the middle of a really brilliant answer about Buckhannon. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And do you want to finish that answer?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Like a  --like a preliminary injunction, it was fleeting. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And I'm not sure that I recall the brilliance that was --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, I will look at the transcript and fill it in, so okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the  -- you know, I was just going to try to talk about strategic mootness maybe a little bit. Maybe that's where  we were going. And, you know --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Sure.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- strategic mootness, as my  -- my  --my colleague has already answered, you've got a voluntary cessation barrier, which, you know, in your decision in Fikre, Justice Gorsuch, it's a pretty formidable burden.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I hope so. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it -- it's a formidable burden. Damages awards, never going to moot out. And it's entirely speculative what effect this is going to have. That's what Buckhannon said. Like, it's not speculative whether it's going to deter counsel or not. And I think this illustrates that. There's no data to show this. This case was started when Smyth was the rule. They had no reason to expect any attorney's fees from a PI, but they took the case. So it's a little hard to say, like, there's this compelling case that, like, we're going to have a  -- a --a crash in civil rights, civil rights era. And there's a real cost, again, to determining  -- to deterring the government from changing course when the action might be lawful but bad policy.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. That's good enough. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So here's the problem that I'm having with your statement of the case as you summarized with Justice Gorsuch. It's that it begins with Sole says that a PI doesn't count because you have to look at what happens afterwards. I'm reading from Sole. ""We express no view on whether, in the absence of a final decision on the merits of a claim for permanent relief, success in gaining a preliminary injunction may sometimes warrant an award of counsel fees.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So I don't know how you can start your case with the premise that Sole stands for the proposition that if you win a preliminary injunction, you have to get to final judgment in order to be entitled to  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it's true  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- counsel fees.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --that the Court reserved that, but the Court also did say that it recognized that a preliminary injunction was just the initial salvo. As I stated in my intro, it's  -- the tentative character makes a fee request at that initial stage premature.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It did not say ""premature.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It says, ""Wyner is not a prevailing party, we conclude, for her initial victory was ephemeral.""  And it was ephemeral in that case because it happened to go on and get reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It's on page 84 of the Court's opinion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> ""The tentative  character would have made the fee request at this initial stage premature.""</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> ""The tentative character"" --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Of the PI.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- ""would have made"" -- yes, but it also says:  ""We express no view as to whether or not that tentative character in  PI is enough to make you a prevailing party.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Agreed, but I think it goes halfway there, and Buckhannon closes the door on that  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- because --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>Anthony A.

2024.23-621-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson, And  --and isn't that the statute we're talking about here? Right?,"<speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  ""Prevailing party"" is a longstanding term of art that means the party for whom judgment is entered, which turns on whether, at the end of the suit, the plaintiff has successfully maintained at least one claim for relief. This Court has repeatedly determined that liability on the merits and liability for fees go hand in hand such that the plaintiffs  -- plaintiff must obtain at least some relief on  the merits of his claim to be a prevailing party. A preliminary injunction reflects a preliminary determination, not a final  determination, that rests on a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits, not actual success on those merits. Sole versus Wyner thus determined that a preliminary injunction's  tentative character makes a fee request at that preliminary initial stage premature. And after that, in this case, the case became moot due to legislative action that Buckhannon teaches does not confer prevailing party status. Now, while a plaintiff whose case is dismissed might not lose on the merits, Section 1988 does not award fees to non-losing parties. It requires prevailing party status. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>Anthony A.

I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Do you think that the statutes in which Congress requires that there be a final order before you can -- before you can have a prevailing party, do you think that's just simply superfluous?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No. No, I don't  --I don't. There's only one statute, by the way, that predates Section 1988. It's Section 1617, which is discussed by the Court in Bradley. All  that does is clarifies that you don't need a true final judgment that ends the case. A final judgment normally is one that resolves all  claims and ceases to terminate -- terminates the case. In the context of -- of Section 1617, that's in the context of school desegregation injunctive orders, and in that context, you often will have a final order, which is a  -- you know, even if it doesn't resolve all claims, but it's final, it's on the merits, you're granting relief on the merits, but the injunction may need to be tweaked as we go along because just any kind of complicated institutional injunction is going to have to be tweaked. That's all Section 1617 requires. It does not depart -- it does not change the normal understanding of ""prevailing party,"" which a prevailing party is one who succeeds at the end of the case because they obtain judgment on at least one claim.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counsel  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say, if I understand it, you don't have to get final judgment on all the claims, right?  You just need to prevail on one. Now, if you prevail on  one, can you get the attorney fees that are associated with 2, 3, and 4?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No. The question -- there's multiple questions in attorney's fees cases. The first is whether you're a prevailing party. You have to succeed on at least one claim on the merits to be prevailing.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> The question then goes to how much fees. That's a  --usually, it's a reasonable fee award. And the reasonableness of the fees, you -- you would look more granularly to determine whether the case -- the issues were intertwined or not. If they're completely separate issues and you lost on them, generally, no, you don't get fees for those.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> What do you do with the case that Justice Jackson posed, which is common?  I want to -- I want to participate in this protest, this parade  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and only the passage of time moots the case. You've gotten all your relief. Nothing you've done or someone else has done has changed it. You got all the relief you really wanted. I wanted to protest.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, you did not get relief on the merits. Now I think a lot of the questions have --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> We -- we keep going back to the operative question here, which is we repeatedly said you don't need a final judgment. You don't need a determination o f the merits. You can have a consent judgment. You can have this. There has to be  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> I don't think that's quite</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- a different sense.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- I don't think that's quite right. The legislative history says you don't need a final judgment following a full trial on the merits. That means you can get a final judgment at an earlier stage through summary judgment before you go to trial, through, for instance, a  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's not a final judgment. You get a judgment --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, summary judgment is a final judgment.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Not until you appeal it. Not until the whole case is litigated. You get a judgment but not final judgment.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> If sum  --if the court grants summary judgment, it is a final judgment if it's on all the claims.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's the  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> If it's summary judgment on part of the claims, then it's subject to revision, so it's not truly final. If it's  -- if it's injunctive and you grant summary judgment and then award injunctive relief, well, that's final because you're actually awarding merits relief at that point.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So, for example, the Chief -- Chief Justice's hypothetical, after the parade, I could ask for a trial on the merits in -- in accompanying the PI and a final judgment could be issued at that time?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That happens all the time. It happens from --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It happens  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And  --and --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- but sometimes it doesn't because it's the court --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and sometimes it doesn't because I might want to go ahead and litigate it because I'm concerned about the same thing in the future and I might want, for example, a declaratory judgment, and I -- I could issue  -- I could --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Or the parade may be annual.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It may be annual.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> A lot of these parades are annual parades.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And I want a prospective injunction going forward.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And then we would have a final judgment on the merits  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- on at least that claim on which you would be prevailing, right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct. Correct. And I -- and I also want to address just a more general point, which is some of the questions were like:  Well, the fees have been incurred, we've got to allocate them. You know, who do  we allocate them to?  Well, that's answered by the American rule. The American rule is each party, win or lose, bears their own fees. And this Court has made clear that you need express statutory authority to depart from that rule. And the statutory --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --and isn't that the statute we're talking about here? Right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, the statute uses a term of art that's existed in statutes since at least -- the American statute since at least 1853.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but it is  -- it is addressing -- it is trying, Congress, to give us an exception to the American rule, and the question is what is the scope of that exception.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But Congress didn't go all the way. Congress adopted a term of art which had  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Prevailing party.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- a settled meaning.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask about Justice Gorsuch's example?  What if I don't want to spend the time and additional money to litigate this through to a declaratory judgment or a future?  What if I just want to march in  the parade tomorrow?  I'm a religious organization, for example. I don't  --you know, I agree with traditional marriage, and tomorrow is the LGBTQ parade and I want to march in it. I want to be able to be there. I  -- I'm not making a whole thing out of it.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I -- I get that. I go to court and I argue the merits of my entitlement  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to be able to do that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And the court says, as a preliminary matter, we don't have a whole trial yet, I think you're going to win, so I'm giving you an injunction and you get to march in the parade.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And I do.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then I'm done. I say the case is mooted because, really, the relief that I wanted was the ability to march in the parade tomorrow. But I did have to pay an attorney to be able to convince you, court, to give me the relief that I requested. I --I guess I don't understand why, under our formulation of the test for a prevailing party in the Lefemine case, what we say  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That was a permanent injunction, and --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand it was a permanent injunction in that case, but I'm asking you, we set up a test for when you are a prevailing party, and the question is why doesn't that test also cover preliminary injunctions like the one that I talked about.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Part of that test is a judgment on the merits, and a judge  -- this is not  -- a preliminary injunction is a tentative determination that does not control anything later in the suit. It's only for the PI stage,  only to adjust the parties' relationships during the suit.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Mr. Yang, does any  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And this is important.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Ms. Maley said that she didn't know of a circuit that it accept ed -- that had accepted this categorical position, if it's a preliminary injunction, there are no fees. Do you know of any circuit that's accepted this categorical position?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, that was the Smyth rule prior to.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Yeah, prior to it being changed, and  --and so now --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, but this Court granted cert on unanimous --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- so now there's -- there's a uniform rule. You don't know of anything  --any court that's gone the other way. You know what?  It's an interesting thing. It seems that this comes up all the time, and it seems as though it's come up frequently just in recent years. When I was talking to my clerks about this, you know, several had confronted this issue with respect to COVID litigation, where  people went to courts and they asked for injunctions from various kinds of COVID policies, and then, you know, in the end, those  policies were changed or were scrapped or were abandoned in some way. So it seems as though there's quite a lot of recent law that cuts against you here from circuits, like, pretty much all across the U.S.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the circuits are not uniform. Some of them look to -- for instance, the Fifth Circuit looks to why the -- the mooting event occurred, but my -- my point -- I want to make two points. One, this Court already addressed the strategic mootness question in Buckhannon and  -- and  -- and addressed that in four different factors. There's two other factors. I want to address two of those first and then I'll go to Buckhannon. One is that Congress has struck a balance here, that there is reason for caution before abandoning what this Court has described as the crucial connection between liability for a violation of federal law on the merits, finding on the merits that you violated federal law, and attorney's fees, and there's reason to -- to give pause before doing that. Congress has sometimes been more generous with the government, but these -- this case -- this statute covers both private individuals and non-federal actors. Secondly, going to Buckhannon, the cost  --there's a cost of deterring federal government action from being voluntarily changed when it may be lawful. Litigation often puts a spotlight on a practice that might not be the best policy even though it's lawful, and the Court in Buckhannon recognized there is a cost to deterring that kind of good government change. Secondly --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Okay. I don't think that that's what I was asking about. I was asking really, you know, do you have any law out there on your side?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> We have a term of art that has gone back --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, what  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- in this Court's decisions, and -- and I think that the courts of appeals just have not been faithful to this Court's decisions.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, that  -- that raises the question for me, why -- why do you think they've been not seeing the light?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, I think sometimes there's  -- as a policy matter, you might decide, hey, you know, this  -- this --I don't like this outcome. I think some of the courts  -- and -- and I acknowledge that there might be some cases like that. But that type of policy call is for Congress to make. So, in Buckhannon, when the Court rejected the catalyst theory, Justice Ginsburg dissented and said:  Hey, look, there's one specific area that's really problematic, FOIA. Congress reacted and did a targeted response to This really goes to the appropriate separation of powers here. Congress adopts a  statute that has a term of art that goes back quite some time. This Court has repeatedly  determined that merits determination, you know, a determination of liability on the merits is crucial to then make  --making the defendant liable for fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Congress --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> The Respondents argue that there is a historical background of a venerable equitable tradition of awarding interim costs, including for a preliminary injunction, and that, if accepted, would perhaps undercut your historical argument. Do you want to say something about that?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> There's two points I would love to make about that. First, this -- this Court already resolved that argument in Alyeska Pipeline. There was a  --and it was actually Justice Marshall's dissent, which was based on equitable principles. What the Court decided in Alyeska Pipeline is that the American rule is each party bears its own costs. There are certain discrete common law exceptions that have evolved. At equity, for instance, the common fund exception,  you get a fund. It would be unjustly  -- you would unjustly enrich the people who benefit unless they pay your fees. That's a fee-sharing, not fee-shifting. Bad faith attorney's fees is another one. Contempt fees is another exception. But the Court did not say equity, you know, it's all -- you know, whatever you think is equitable. The Court recognized that there are very discrete limits. And I think that's illustrated by the only case that they cite, the only case that they cite as  --as supporting a PI fee award, and that's Clancy versus Geb. In that case, it was not based on the temporary injunction that was issued on the day the suit was filed. The court said it was based on the trial on the merits that sustained the cause of action for an injunction. Now, after the trial on the merits, the court didn't grant further injunctive relief, and that might be a problem, but it certainly does not  stand for the proposition that a TRO or, you know -- or a PI gets you prevailing party status. There was a final adjudication on the merits of the -- of the cause of action.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Just to be clear, Buckhannon, there was no court -ordered relief whatsoever, correct?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's true. That's true.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as I read the decision, that was mostly the focus of the decision?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, certainly, the catalyst theory was  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It was the prime focus.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- but the catalyst --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- theory does not -- we're not escaping the catalyst theory here because  the catalyst theory is embedded in this case. It is the second -- it is what happened with this case after --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you're  -- you're -- you're claiming there is no catalyst theory because you're saying the legislature acted -- or the other side is saying it acted independently, so it -- it has nothing to do --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the catalyst theory was rejected in Buckhannon.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> They're saying it doesn't matter why the case ends. It just ended with a judgment, dismissal of the action. It could be for mootness. It could be because the other side gave up. I got what I came for at least in part. I got my license back. I drove for 16 months. I didn't have to pay anybody to get my license back. I won for those  --that part of my relief. And it's never been dissolved, reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But that's not what the term ""prevailing party"" has been understood, either by this Court or by the dictionary definitions that date back from before the -- the  -- the 20th Century. That has required a final adjudication  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well, that's the problem. No, it's never required a final adjudication. It's required a judgment but not a final one.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it has. I mean, even  --even the legislative history -- this Court in Hanrahan discussed the legislative history. It's all in dicta, but it discussed the legislative history of Section 1988, and what  --the conclusion the Court drew was that interim fees, meaning before the case is finally over, only -- were available only when the party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of its claims. And that happens when you get a final determination, maybe not a final judgment because you're not resolving all claims or maybe because there's some ongoing litigation about the nature of the injunctive relief.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Yang. We -- we have a difference of opinion on what finality means. If all you're seeking  is a preliminary injunction, that's final for that purpose.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> You don't  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That  -- that's the problem we're having.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --file suits for preliminary injunctions. You file suits for  equitable relief, a judgment at the end of the suit. A preliminary injunction is a preliminary matter that protects the parties while the suit is adjudicated.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Let me see if I've got it. So a PI can't be the basis for a  --a -- an award of fees under this statute because Sole basically says you have to look at what happens afterwards. And for all the reasons you just gave, a PI is a PI. It's preliminary. It's not  --okay. All right. Fine. Now  -- so we have to look what happened afterwards. And, here, what happened afterwards is plaintiffs may well have convinced  the Virginia state legislature to change their mind in a catalyst sort of way.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> The problem is Buckhannon says that doesn't work either.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. But Justice Ginsburg in Buckhannon says, hey, Congress should fix that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And Congress did fix it in FOIA --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yep.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and said involuntary  -- voluntary cessation and changes, you still get fees. But --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So long as it's not an insubstantial claim.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So quite generous, with the government's money, of course. You know, it's quite different when we're talking about privat e litigants and non-federal. I think Congress might be more reticent to creating such a generous departure from even the prevailing party standard, but it could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And it hasn't here.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> End of case. That's your theory of the case?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's our theory.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. Got it.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I think, when the red light went on, you were in the middle of a really brilliant answer about Buckhannon. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And do you want to finish that answer?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Like a  --like a preliminary injunction, it was fleeting. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And I'm not sure that I recall the brilliance that was --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, I will look at the transcript and fill it in, so okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the  -- you know, I was just going to try to talk about strategic mootness maybe a little bit. Maybe that's where  we were going. And, you know --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Sure.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- strategic mootness, as my  -- my  --my colleague has already answered, you've got a voluntary cessation barrier, which, you know, in your decision in Fikre, Justice Gorsuch, it's a pretty formidable burden.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I hope so. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it -- it's a formidable burden. Damages awards, never going to moot out. And it's entirely speculative what effect this is going to have. That's what Buckhannon said. Like, it's not speculative whether it's going to deter counsel or not. And I think this illustrates that. There's no data to show this. This case was started when Smyth was the rule. They had no reason to expect any attorney's fees from a PI, but they took the case. So it's a little hard to say, like, there's this compelling case that, like, we're going to have a  -- a --a crash in civil rights, civil rights era. And there's a real cost, again, to determining  -- to deterring the government from changing course when the action might be lawful but bad policy.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. That's good enough. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So here's the problem that I'm having with your statement of the case as you summarized with Justice Gorsuch. It's that it begins with Sole says that a PI doesn't count because you have to look at what happens afterwards. I'm reading from Sole. ""We express no view on whether, in the absence of a final decision on the merits of a claim for permanent relief, success in gaining a preliminary injunction may sometimes warrant an award of counsel fees.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So I don't know how you can start your case with the premise that Sole stands for the proposition that if you win a preliminary injunction, you have to get to final judgment in order to be entitled to  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it's true  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- counsel fees.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --that the Court reserved that, but the Court also did say that it recognized that a preliminary injunction was just the initial salvo. As I stated in my intro, it's  -- the tentative character makes a fee request at that initial stage premature.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It did not say ""premature.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It says, ""Wyner is not a prevailing party, we conclude, for her initial victory was ephemeral.""  And it was ephemeral in that case because it happened to go on and get reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It's on page 84 of the Court's opinion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> ""The tentative  character would have made the fee request at this initial stage premature.""</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> ""The tentative character"" --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Of the PI.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- ""would have made"" -- yes, but it also says:  ""We express no view as to whether or not that tentative character in  PI is enough to make you a prevailing party.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Agreed, but I think it goes halfway there, and Buckhannon closes the door on that  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- because --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text>Mr. Schmalzbach.</text>",coherent
2024.23-621-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," Ms. Maley said that she didn't know of a circuit that it accept ed -- that had accepted this categorical position, if it's a preliminary injunction, there are no fees. Do you know of any circuit that's accepted this categorical position?","<speaker>Anthony A.

I welcome the Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>Anthony A.

I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Do you think that the statutes in which Congress requires that there be a final order before you can -- before you can have a prevailing party, do you think that's just simply superfluous?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No. No, I don't  --I don't. There's only one statute, by the way, that predates Section 1988. It's Section 1617, which is discussed by the Court in Bradley. All  that does is clarifies that you don't need a true final judgment that ends the case. A final judgment normally is one that resolves all  claims and ceases to terminate -- terminates the case. In the context of -- of Section 1617, that's in the context of school desegregation injunctive orders, and in that context, you often will have a final order, which is a  -- you know, even if it doesn't resolve all claims, but it's final, it's on the merits, you're granting relief on the merits, but the injunction may need to be tweaked as we go along because just any kind of complicated institutional injunction is going to have to be tweaked. That's all Section 1617 requires. It does not depart -- it does not change the normal understanding of ""prevailing party,"" which a prevailing party is one who succeeds at the end of the case because they obtain judgment on at least one claim.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counsel  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say, if I understand it, you don't have to get final judgment on all the claims, right?  You just need to prevail on one. Now, if you prevail on  one, can you get the attorney fees that are associated with 2, 3, and 4?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No. The question -- there's multiple questions in attorney's fees cases. The first is whether you're a prevailing party. You have to succeed on at least one claim on the merits to be prevailing.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> The question then goes to how much fees. That's a  --usually, it's a reasonable fee award. And the reasonableness of the fees, you -- you would look more granularly to determine whether the case -- the issues were intertwined or not. If they're completely separate issues and you lost on them, generally, no, you don't get fees for those.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> What do you do with the case that Justice Jackson posed, which is common?  I want to -- I want to participate in this protest, this parade  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and only the passage of time moots the case. You've gotten all your relief. Nothing you've done or someone else has done has changed it. You got all the relief you really wanted. I wanted to protest.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, you did not get relief on the merits. Now I think a lot of the questions have --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> We -- we keep going back to the operative question here, which is we repeatedly said you don't need a final judgment. You don't need a determination o f the merits. You can have a consent judgment. You can have this. There has to be  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> I don't think that's quite</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- a different sense.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- I don't think that's quite right. The legislative history says you don't need a final judgment following a full trial on the merits. That means you can get a final judgment at an earlier stage through summary judgment before you go to trial, through, for instance, a  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's not a final judgment. You get a judgment --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, summary judgment is a final judgment.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Not until you appeal it. Not until the whole case is litigated. You get a judgment but not final judgment.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> If sum  --if the court grants summary judgment, it is a final judgment if it's on all the claims.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's the  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> If it's summary judgment on part of the claims, then it's subject to revision, so it's not truly final. If it's  -- if it's injunctive and you grant summary judgment and then award injunctive relief, well, that's final because you're actually awarding merits relief at that point.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So, for example, the Chief -- Chief Justice's hypothetical, after the parade, I could ask for a trial on the merits in -- in accompanying the PI and a final judgment could be issued at that time?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That happens all the time. It happens from --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It happens  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And  --and --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- but sometimes it doesn't because it's the court --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and sometimes it doesn't because I might want to go ahead and litigate it because I'm concerned about the same thing in the future and I might want, for example, a declaratory judgment, and I -- I could issue  -- I could --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Or the parade may be annual.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It may be annual.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> A lot of these parades are annual parades.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And I want a prospective injunction going forward.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And then we would have a final judgment on the merits  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- on at least that claim on which you would be prevailing, right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct. Correct. And I -- and I also want to address just a more general point, which is some of the questions were like:  Well, the fees have been incurred, we've got to allocate them. You know, who do  we allocate them to?  Well, that's answered by the American rule. The American rule is each party, win or lose, bears their own fees. And this Court has made clear that you need express statutory authority to depart from that rule. And the statutory --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --and isn't that the statute we're talking about here? Right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, the statute uses a term of art that's existed in statutes since at least -- the American statute since at least 1853.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but it is  -- it is addressing -- it is trying, Congress, to give us an exception to the American rule, and the question is what is the scope of that exception.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But Congress didn't go all the way. Congress adopted a term of art which had  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Prevailing party.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- a settled meaning.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask about Justice Gorsuch's example?  What if I don't want to spend the time and additional money to litigate this through to a declaratory judgment or a future?  What if I just want to march in  the parade tomorrow?  I'm a religious organization, for example. I don't  --you know, I agree with traditional marriage, and tomorrow is the LGBTQ parade and I want to march in it. I want to be able to be there. I  -- I'm not making a whole thing out of it.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I -- I get that. I go to court and I argue the merits of my entitlement  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to be able to do that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And the court says, as a preliminary matter, we don't have a whole trial yet, I think you're going to win, so I'm giving you an injunction and you get to march in the parade.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And I do.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then I'm done. I say the case is mooted because, really, the relief that I wanted was the ability to march in the parade tomorrow. But I did have to pay an attorney to be able to convince you, court, to give me the relief that I requested. I --I guess I don't understand why, under our formulation of the test for a prevailing party in the Lefemine case, what we say  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That was a permanent injunction, and --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand it was a permanent injunction in that case, but I'm asking you, we set up a test for when you are a prevailing party, and the question is why doesn't that test also cover preliminary injunctions like the one that I talked about.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Part of that test is a judgment on the merits, and a judge  -- this is not  -- a preliminary injunction is a tentative determination that does not control anything later in the suit. It's only for the PI stage,  only to adjust the parties' relationships during the suit.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Mr. Yang, does any  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And this is important.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Ms. Maley said that she didn't know of a circuit that it accept ed -- that had accepted this categorical position, if it's a preliminary injunction, there are no fees. Do you know of any circuit that's accepted this categorical position?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, that was the Smyth rule prior to.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Yeah, prior to it being changed, and  --and so now --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, but this Court granted cert on unanimous --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- so now there's -- there's a uniform rule. You don't know of anything  --any court that's gone the other way. You know what?  It's an interesting thing. It seems that this comes up all the time, and it seems as though it's come up frequently just in recent years. When I was talking to my clerks about this, you know, several had confronted this issue with respect to COVID litigation, where  people went to courts and they asked for injunctions from various kinds of COVID policies, and then, you know, in the end, those  policies were changed or were scrapped or were abandoned in some way. So it seems as though there's quite a lot of recent law that cuts against you here from circuits, like, pretty much all across the U.S.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the circuits are not uniform. Some of them look to -- for instance, the Fifth Circuit looks to why the -- the mooting event occurred, but my -- my point -- I want to make two points. One, this Court already addressed the strategic mootness question in Buckhannon and  -- and  -- and addressed that in four different factors. There's two other factors. I want to address two of those first and then I'll go to Buckhannon. One is that Congress has struck a balance here, that there is reason for caution before abandoning what this Court has described as the crucial connection between liability for a violation of federal law on the merits, finding on the merits that you violated federal law, and attorney's fees, and there's reason to -- to give pause before doing that. Congress has sometimes been more generous with the government, but these -- this case -- this statute covers both private individuals and non-federal actors. Secondly, going to Buckhannon, the cost  --there's a cost of deterring federal government action from being voluntarily changed when it may be lawful. Litigation often puts a spotlight on a practice that might not be the best policy even though it's lawful, and the Court in Buckhannon recognized there is a cost to deterring that kind of good government change. Secondly --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Okay. I don't think that that's what I was asking about. I was asking really, you know, do you have any law out there on your side?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> We have a term of art that has gone back --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, what  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- in this Court's decisions, and -- and I think that the courts of appeals just have not been faithful to this Court's decisions.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, that  -- that raises the question for me, why -- why do you think they've been not seeing the light?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, I think sometimes there's  -- as a policy matter, you might decide, hey, you know, this  -- this --I don't like this outcome. I think some of the courts  -- and -- and I acknowledge that there might be some cases like that. But that type of policy call is for Congress to make. So, in Buckhannon, when the Court rejected the catalyst theory, Justice Ginsburg dissented and said:  Hey, look, there's one specific area that's really problematic, FOIA. Congress reacted and did a targeted response to This really goes to the appropriate separation of powers here. Congress adopts a  statute that has a term of art that goes back quite some time. This Court has repeatedly  determined that merits determination, you know, a determination of liability on the merits is crucial to then make  --making the defendant liable for fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Congress --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> The Respondents argue that there is a historical background of a venerable equitable tradition of awarding interim costs, including for a preliminary injunction, and that, if accepted, would perhaps undercut your historical argument. Do you want to say something about that?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> There's two points I would love to make about that. First, this -- this Court already resolved that argument in Alyeska Pipeline. There was a  --and it was actually Justice Marshall's dissent, which was based on equitable principles. What the Court decided in Alyeska Pipeline is that the American rule is each party bears its own costs. There are certain discrete common law exceptions that have evolved. At equity, for instance, the common fund exception,  you get a fund. It would be unjustly  -- you would unjustly enrich the people who benefit unless they pay your fees. That's a fee-sharing, not fee-shifting. Bad faith attorney's fees is another one. Contempt fees is another exception. But the Court did not say equity, you know, it's all -- you know, whatever you think is equitable. The Court recognized that there are very discrete limits. And I think that's illustrated by the only case that they cite, the only case that they cite as  --as supporting a PI fee award, and that's Clancy versus Geb. In that case, it was not based on the temporary injunction that was issued on the day the suit was filed. The court said it was based on the trial on the merits that sustained the cause of action for an injunction. Now, after the trial on the merits, the court didn't grant further injunctive relief, and that might be a problem, but it certainly does not  stand for the proposition that a TRO or, you know -- or a PI gets you prevailing party status. There was a final adjudication on the merits of the -- of the cause of action.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Just to be clear, Buckhannon, there was no court -ordered relief whatsoever, correct?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's true. That's true.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as I read the decision, that was mostly the focus of the decision?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, certainly, the catalyst theory was  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It was the prime focus.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- but the catalyst --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- theory does not -- we're not escaping the catalyst theory here because  the catalyst theory is embedded in this case. It is the second -- it is what happened with this case after --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you're  -- you're -- you're claiming there is no catalyst theory because you're saying the legislature acted -- or the other side is saying it acted independently, so it -- it has nothing to do --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the catalyst theory was rejected in Buckhannon.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> They're saying it doesn't matter why the case ends. It just ended with a judgment, dismissal of the action. It could be for mootness. It could be because the other side gave up. I got what I came for at least in part. I got my license back. I drove for 16 months. I didn't have to pay anybody to get my license back. I won for those  --that part of my relief. And it's never been dissolved, reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But that's not what the term ""prevailing party"" has been understood, either by this Court or by the dictionary definitions that date back from before the -- the  -- the 20th Century. That has required a final adjudication  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well, that's the problem. No, it's never required a final adjudication. It's required a judgment but not a final one.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it has. I mean, even  --even the legislative history -- this Court in Hanrahan discussed the legislative history. It's all in dicta, but it discussed the legislative history of Section 1988, and what  --the conclusion the Court drew was that interim fees, meaning before the case is finally over, only -- were available only when the party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of its claims. And that happens when you get a final determination, maybe not a final judgment because you're not resolving all claims or maybe because there's some ongoing litigation about the nature of the injunctive relief.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Yang. We -- we have a difference of opinion on what finality means. If all you're seeking  is a preliminary injunction, that's final for that purpose.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> You don't  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That  -- that's the problem we're having.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --file suits for preliminary injunctions. You file suits for  equitable relief, a judgment at the end of the suit. A preliminary injunction is a preliminary matter that protects the parties while the suit is adjudicated.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Let me see if I've got it. So a PI can't be the basis for a  --a -- an award of fees under this statute because Sole basically says you have to look at what happens afterwards. And for all the reasons you just gave, a PI is a PI. It's preliminary. It's not  --okay. All right. Fine. Now  -- so we have to look what happened afterwards. And, here, what happened afterwards is plaintiffs may well have convinced  the Virginia state legislature to change their mind in a catalyst sort of way.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> The problem is Buckhannon says that doesn't work either.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. But Justice Ginsburg in Buckhannon says, hey, Congress should fix that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And Congress did fix it in FOIA --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yep.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and said involuntary  -- voluntary cessation and changes, you still get fees. But --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So long as it's not an insubstantial claim.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So quite generous, with the government's money, of course. You know, it's quite different when we're talking about privat e litigants and non-federal. I think Congress might be more reticent to creating such a generous departure from even the prevailing party standard, but it could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And it hasn't here.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> End of case. That's your theory of the case?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's our theory.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. Got it.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I think, when the red light went on, you were in the middle of a really brilliant answer about Buckhannon. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And do you want to finish that answer?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Like a  --like a preliminary injunction, it was fleeting. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And I'm not sure that I recall the brilliance that was --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, I will look at the transcript and fill it in, so okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the  -- you know, I was just going to try to talk about strategic mootness maybe a little bit. Maybe that's where  we were going. And, you know --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Sure.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- strategic mootness, as my  -- my  --my colleague has already answered, you've got a voluntary cessation barrier, which, you know, in your decision in Fikre, Justice Gorsuch, it's a pretty formidable burden.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I hope so. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it -- it's a formidable burden. Damages awards, never going to moot out. And it's entirely speculative what effect this is going to have. That's what Buckhannon said. Like, it's not speculative whether it's going to deter counsel or not. And I think this illustrates that. There's no data to show this. This case was started when Smyth was the rule. They had no reason to expect any attorney's fees from a PI, but they took the case. So it's a little hard to say, like, there's this compelling case that, like, we're going to have a  -- a --a crash in civil rights, civil rights era. And there's a real cost, again, to determining  -- to deterring the government from changing course when the action might be lawful but bad policy.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. That's good enough. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So here's the problem that I'm having with your statement of the case as you summarized with Justice Gorsuch. It's that it begins with Sole says that a PI doesn't count because you have to look at what happens afterwards. I'm reading from Sole. ""We express no view on whether, in the absence of a final decision on the merits of a claim for permanent relief, success in gaining a preliminary injunction may sometimes warrant an award of counsel fees.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So I don't know how you can start your case with the premise that Sole stands for the proposition that if you win a preliminary injunction, you have to get to final judgment in order to be entitled to  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it's true  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- counsel fees.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --that the Court reserved that, but the Court also did say that it recognized that a preliminary injunction was just the initial salvo. As I stated in my intro, it's  -- the tentative character makes a fee request at that initial stage premature.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It did not say ""premature.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It says, ""Wyner is not a prevailing party, we conclude, for her initial victory was ephemeral.""  And it was ephemeral in that case because it happened to go on and get reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It's on page 84 of the Court's opinion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> ""The tentative  character would have made the fee request at this initial stage premature.""</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> ""The tentative character"" --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Of the PI.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- ""would have made"" -- yes, but it also says:  ""We express no view as to whether or not that tentative character in  PI is enough to make you a prevailing party.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Agreed, but I think it goes halfway there, and Buckhannon closes the door on that  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- because --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>Anthony A.

2024.23-621-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," Okay. I don't think that that's what I was asking about. I was asking really, you know, do you have any law out there on your side?","<speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  ""Prevailing party"" is a longstanding term of art that means the party for whom judgment is entered, which turns on whether, at the end of the suit, the plaintiff has successfully maintained at least one claim for relief. This Court has repeatedly determined that liability on the merits and liability for fees go hand in hand such that the plaintiffs  -- plaintiff must obtain at least some relief on  the merits of his claim to be a prevailing party. A preliminary injunction reflects a preliminary determination, not a final  determination, that rests on a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits, not actual success on those merits. Sole versus Wyner thus determined that a preliminary injunction's  tentative character makes a fee request at that preliminary initial stage premature. And after that, in this case, the case became moot due to legislative action that Buckhannon teaches does not confer prevailing party status. Now, while a plaintiff whose case is dismissed might not lose on the merits, Section 1988 does not award fees to non-losing parties. It requires prevailing party status. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>Anthony A.

I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Do you think that the statutes in which Congress requires that there be a final order before you can -- before you can have a prevailing party, do you think that's just simply superfluous?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No. No, I don't  --I don't. There's only one statute, by the way, that predates Section 1988. It's Section 1617, which is discussed by the Court in Bradley. All  that does is clarifies that you don't need a true final judgment that ends the case. A final judgment normally is one that resolves all  claims and ceases to terminate -- terminates the case. In the context of -- of Section 1617, that's in the context of school desegregation injunctive orders, and in that context, you often will have a final order, which is a  -- you know, even if it doesn't resolve all claims, but it's final, it's on the merits, you're granting relief on the merits, but the injunction may need to be tweaked as we go along because just any kind of complicated institutional injunction is going to have to be tweaked. That's all Section 1617 requires. It does not depart -- it does not change the normal understanding of ""prevailing party,"" which a prevailing party is one who succeeds at the end of the case because they obtain judgment on at least one claim.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counsel  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say, if I understand it, you don't have to get final judgment on all the claims, right?  You just need to prevail on one. Now, if you prevail on  one, can you get the attorney fees that are associated with 2, 3, and 4?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No. The question -- there's multiple questions in attorney's fees cases. The first is whether you're a prevailing party. You have to succeed on at least one claim on the merits to be prevailing.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> The question then goes to how much fees. That's a  --usually, it's a reasonable fee award. And the reasonableness of the fees, you -- you would look more granularly to determine whether the case -- the issues were intertwined or not. If they're completely separate issues and you lost on them, generally, no, you don't get fees for those.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> What do you do with the case that Justice Jackson posed, which is common?  I want to -- I want to participate in this protest, this parade  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and only the passage of time moots the case. You've gotten all your relief. Nothing you've done or someone else has done has changed it. You got all the relief you really wanted. I wanted to protest.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, you did not get relief on the merits. Now I think a lot of the questions have --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> We -- we keep going back to the operative question here, which is we repeatedly said you don't need a final judgment. You don't need a determination o f the merits. You can have a consent judgment. You can have this. There has to be  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> I don't think that's quite</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- a different sense.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- I don't think that's quite right. The legislative history says you don't need a final judgment following a full trial on the merits. That means you can get a final judgment at an earlier stage through summary judgment before you go to trial, through, for instance, a  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's not a final judgment. You get a judgment --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, summary judgment is a final judgment.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Not until you appeal it. Not until the whole case is litigated. You get a judgment but not final judgment.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> If sum  --if the court grants summary judgment, it is a final judgment if it's on all the claims.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's the  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> If it's summary judgment on part of the claims, then it's subject to revision, so it's not truly final. If it's  -- if it's injunctive and you grant summary judgment and then award injunctive relief, well, that's final because you're actually awarding merits relief at that point.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So, for example, the Chief -- Chief Justice's hypothetical, after the parade, I could ask for a trial on the merits in -- in accompanying the PI and a final judgment could be issued at that time?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That happens all the time. It happens from --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It happens  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And  --and --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- but sometimes it doesn't because it's the court --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and sometimes it doesn't because I might want to go ahead and litigate it because I'm concerned about the same thing in the future and I might want, for example, a declaratory judgment, and I -- I could issue  -- I could --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Or the parade may be annual.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It may be annual.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> A lot of these parades are annual parades.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And I want a prospective injunction going forward.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And then we would have a final judgment on the merits  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- on at least that claim on which you would be prevailing, right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct. Correct. And I -- and I also want to address just a more general point, which is some of the questions were like:  Well, the fees have been incurred, we've got to allocate them. You know, who do  we allocate them to?  Well, that's answered by the American rule. The American rule is each party, win or lose, bears their own fees. And this Court has made clear that you need express statutory authority to depart from that rule. And the statutory --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --and isn't that the statute we're talking about here? Right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, the statute uses a term of art that's existed in statutes since at least -- the American statute since at least 1853.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but it is  -- it is addressing -- it is trying, Congress, to give us an exception to the American rule, and the question is what is the scope of that exception.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But Congress didn't go all the way. Congress adopted a term of art which had  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Prevailing party.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- a settled meaning.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask about Justice Gorsuch's example?  What if I don't want to spend the time and additional money to litigate this through to a declaratory judgment or a future?  What if I just want to march in  the parade tomorrow?  I'm a religious organization, for example. I don't  --you know, I agree with traditional marriage, and tomorrow is the LGBTQ parade and I want to march in it. I want to be able to be there. I  -- I'm not making a whole thing out of it.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I -- I get that. I go to court and I argue the merits of my entitlement  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to be able to do that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And the court says, as a preliminary matter, we don't have a whole trial yet, I think you're going to win, so I'm giving you an injunction and you get to march in the parade.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And I do.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then I'm done. I say the case is mooted because, really, the relief that I wanted was the ability to march in the parade tomorrow. But I did have to pay an attorney to be able to convince you, court, to give me the relief that I requested. I --I guess I don't understand why, under our formulation of the test for a prevailing party in the Lefemine case, what we say  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That was a permanent injunction, and --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand it was a permanent injunction in that case, but I'm asking you, we set up a test for when you are a prevailing party, and the question is why doesn't that test also cover preliminary injunctions like the one that I talked about.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Part of that test is a judgment on the merits, and a judge  -- this is not  -- a preliminary injunction is a tentative determination that does not control anything later in the suit. It's only for the PI stage,  only to adjust the parties' relationships during the suit.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Mr. Yang, does any  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And this is important.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Ms. Maley said that she didn't know of a circuit that it accept ed -- that had accepted this categorical position, if it's a preliminary injunction, there are no fees. Do you know of any circuit that's accepted this categorical position?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, that was the Smyth rule prior to.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Yeah, prior to it being changed, and  --and so now --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, but this Court granted cert on unanimous --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- so now there's -- there's a uniform rule. You don't know of anything  --any court that's gone the other way. You know what?  It's an interesting thing. It seems that this comes up all the time, and it seems as though it's come up frequently just in recent years. When I was talking to my clerks about this, you know, several had confronted this issue with respect to COVID litigation, where  people went to courts and they asked for injunctions from various kinds of COVID policies, and then, you know, in the end, those  policies were changed or were scrapped or were abandoned in some way. So it seems as though there's quite a lot of recent law that cuts against you here from circuits, like, pretty much all across the U.S.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the circuits are not uniform. Some of them look to -- for instance, the Fifth Circuit looks to why the -- the mooting event occurred, but my -- my point -- I want to make two points. One, this Court already addressed the strategic mootness question in Buckhannon and  -- and  -- and addressed that in four different factors. There's two other factors. I want to address two of those first and then I'll go to Buckhannon. One is that Congress has struck a balance here, that there is reason for caution before abandoning what this Court has described as the crucial connection between liability for a violation of federal law on the merits, finding on the merits that you violated federal law, and attorney's fees, and there's reason to -- to give pause before doing that. Congress has sometimes been more generous with the government, but these -- this case -- this statute covers both private individuals and non-federal actors. Secondly, going to Buckhannon, the cost  --there's a cost of deterring federal government action from being voluntarily changed when it may be lawful. Litigation often puts a spotlight on a practice that might not be the best policy even though it's lawful, and the Court in Buckhannon recognized there is a cost to deterring that kind of good government change. Secondly --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Okay. I don't think that that's what I was asking about. I was asking really, you know, do you have any law out there on your side?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> We have a term of art that has gone back --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, what  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- in this Court's decisions, and -- and I think that the courts of appeals just have not been faithful to this Court's decisions.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, that  -- that raises the question for me, why -- why do you think they've been not seeing the light?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, I think sometimes there's  -- as a policy matter, you might decide, hey, you know, this  -- this --I don't like this outcome. I think some of the courts  -- and -- and I acknowledge that there might be some cases like that. But that type of policy call is for Congress to make. So, in Buckhannon, when the Court rejected the catalyst theory, Justice Ginsburg dissented and said:  Hey, look, there's one specific area that's really problematic, FOIA. Congress reacted and did a targeted response to This really goes to the appropriate separation of powers here. Congress adopts a  statute that has a term of art that goes back quite some time. This Court has repeatedly  determined that merits determination, you know, a determination of liability on the merits is crucial to then make  --making the defendant liable for fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Congress --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> The Respondents argue that there is a historical background of a venerable equitable tradition of awarding interim costs, including for a preliminary injunction, and that, if accepted, would perhaps undercut your historical argument. Do you want to say something about that?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> There's two points I would love to make about that. First, this -- this Court already resolved that argument in Alyeska Pipeline. There was a  --and it was actually Justice Marshall's dissent, which was based on equitable principles. What the Court decided in Alyeska Pipeline is that the American rule is each party bears its own costs. There are certain discrete common law exceptions that have evolved. At equity, for instance, the common fund exception,  you get a fund. It would be unjustly  -- you would unjustly enrich the people who benefit unless they pay your fees. That's a fee-sharing, not fee-shifting. Bad faith attorney's fees is another one. Contempt fees is another exception. But the Court did not say equity, you know, it's all -- you know, whatever you think is equitable. The Court recognized that there are very discrete limits. And I think that's illustrated by the only case that they cite, the only case that they cite as  --as supporting a PI fee award, and that's Clancy versus Geb. In that case, it was not based on the temporary injunction that was issued on the day the suit was filed. The court said it was based on the trial on the merits that sustained the cause of action for an injunction. Now, after the trial on the merits, the court didn't grant further injunctive relief, and that might be a problem, but it certainly does not  stand for the proposition that a TRO or, you know -- or a PI gets you prevailing party status. There was a final adjudication on the merits of the -- of the cause of action.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Just to be clear, Buckhannon, there was no court -ordered relief whatsoever, correct?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's true. That's true.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as I read the decision, that was mostly the focus of the decision?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, certainly, the catalyst theory was  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It was the prime focus.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- but the catalyst --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- theory does not -- we're not escaping the catalyst theory here because  the catalyst theory is embedded in this case. It is the second -- it is what happened with this case after --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you're  -- you're -- you're claiming there is no catalyst theory because you're saying the legislature acted -- or the other side is saying it acted independently, so it -- it has nothing to do --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the catalyst theory was rejected in Buckhannon.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> They're saying it doesn't matter why the case ends. It just ended with a judgment, dismissal of the action. It could be for mootness. It could be because the other side gave up. I got what I came for at least in part. I got my license back. I drove for 16 months. I didn't have to pay anybody to get my license back. I won for those  --that part of my relief. And it's never been dissolved, reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But that's not what the term ""prevailing party"" has been understood, either by this Court or by the dictionary definitions that date back from before the -- the  -- the 20th Century. That has required a final adjudication  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well, that's the problem. No, it's never required a final adjudication. It's required a judgment but not a final one.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it has. I mean, even  --even the legislative history -- this Court in Hanrahan discussed the legislative history. It's all in dicta, but it discussed the legislative history of Section 1988, and what  --the conclusion the Court drew was that interim fees, meaning before the case is finally over, only -- were available only when the party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of its claims. And that happens when you get a final determination, maybe not a final judgment because you're not resolving all claims or maybe because there's some ongoing litigation about the nature of the injunctive relief.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Yang. We -- we have a difference of opinion on what finality means. If all you're seeking  is a preliminary injunction, that's final for that purpose.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> You don't  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That  -- that's the problem we're having.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --file suits for preliminary injunctions. You file suits for  equitable relief, a judgment at the end of the suit. A preliminary injunction is a preliminary matter that protects the parties while the suit is adjudicated.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Let me see if I've got it. So a PI can't be the basis for a  --a -- an award of fees under this statute because Sole basically says you have to look at what happens afterwards. And for all the reasons you just gave, a PI is a PI. It's preliminary. It's not  --okay. All right. Fine. Now  -- so we have to look what happened afterwards. And, here, what happened afterwards is plaintiffs may well have convinced  the Virginia state legislature to change their mind in a catalyst sort of way.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> The problem is Buckhannon says that doesn't work either.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. But Justice Ginsburg in Buckhannon says, hey, Congress should fix that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And Congress did fix it in FOIA --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yep.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and said involuntary  -- voluntary cessation and changes, you still get fees. But --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So long as it's not an insubstantial claim.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So quite generous, with the government's money, of course. You know, it's quite different when we're talking about privat e litigants and non-federal. I think Congress might be more reticent to creating such a generous departure from even the prevailing party standard, but it could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And it hasn't here.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> End of case. That's your theory of the case?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's our theory.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. Got it.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I think, when the red light went on, you were in the middle of a really brilliant answer about Buckhannon. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And do you want to finish that answer?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Like a  --like a preliminary injunction, it was fleeting. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And I'm not sure that I recall the brilliance that was --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, I will look at the transcript and fill it in, so okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the  -- you know, I was just going to try to talk about strategic mootness maybe a little bit. Maybe that's where  we were going. And, you know --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Sure.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- strategic mootness, as my  -- my  --my colleague has already answered, you've got a voluntary cessation barrier, which, you know, in your decision in Fikre, Justice Gorsuch, it's a pretty formidable burden.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I hope so. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it -- it's a formidable burden. Damages awards, never going to moot out. And it's entirely speculative what effect this is going to have. That's what Buckhannon said. Like, it's not speculative whether it's going to deter counsel or not. And I think this illustrates that. There's no data to show this. This case was started when Smyth was the rule. They had no reason to expect any attorney's fees from a PI, but they took the case. So it's a little hard to say, like, there's this compelling case that, like, we're going to have a  -- a --a crash in civil rights, civil rights era. And there's a real cost, again, to determining  -- to deterring the government from changing course when the action might be lawful but bad policy.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. That's good enough. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So here's the problem that I'm having with your statement of the case as you summarized with Justice Gorsuch. It's that it begins with Sole says that a PI doesn't count because you have to look at what happens afterwards. I'm reading from Sole. ""We express no view on whether, in the absence of a final decision on the merits of a claim for permanent relief, success in gaining a preliminary injunction may sometimes warrant an award of counsel fees.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So I don't know how you can start your case with the premise that Sole stands for the proposition that if you win a preliminary injunction, you have to get to final judgment in order to be entitled to  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it's true  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- counsel fees.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --that the Court reserved that, but the Court also did say that it recognized that a preliminary injunction was just the initial salvo. As I stated in my intro, it's  -- the tentative character makes a fee request at that initial stage premature.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It did not say ""premature.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It says, ""Wyner is not a prevailing party, we conclude, for her initial victory was ephemeral.""  And it was ephemeral in that case because it happened to go on and get reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It's on page 84 of the Court's opinion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> ""The tentative  character would have made the fee request at this initial stage premature.""</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> ""The tentative character"" --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Of the PI.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- ""would have made"" -- yes, but it also says:  ""We express no view as to whether or not that tentative character in  PI is enough to make you a prevailing party.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Agreed, but I think it goes halfway there, and Buckhannon closes the door on that  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- because --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>Anthony A.

I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Do you think that the statutes in which Congress requires that there be a final order before you can -- before you can have a prevailing party, do you think that's just simply superfluous?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No. No, I don't  --I don't. There's only one statute, by the way, that predates Section 1988. It's Section 1617, which is discussed by the Court in Bradley. All  that does is clarifies that you don't need a true final judgment that ends the case. A final judgment normally is one that resolves all  claims and ceases to terminate -- terminates the case. In the context of -- of Section 1617, that's in the context of school desegregation injunctive orders, and in that context, you often will have a final order, which is a  -- you know, even if it doesn't resolve all claims, but it's final, it's on the merits, you're granting relief on the merits, but the injunction may need to be tweaked as we go along because just any kind of complicated institutional injunction is going to have to be tweaked. That's all Section 1617 requires. It does not depart -- it does not change the normal understanding of ""prevailing party,"" which a prevailing party is one who succeeds at the end of the case because they obtain judgment on at least one claim.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counsel  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say, if I understand it, you don't have to get final judgment on all the claims, right?  You just need to prevail on one. Now, if you prevail on  one, can you get the attorney fees that are associated with 2, 3, and 4?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No. The question -- there's multiple questions in attorney's fees cases. The first is whether you're a prevailing party. You have to succeed on at least one claim on the merits to be prevailing.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> The question then goes to how much fees. That's a  --usually, it's a reasonable fee award. And the reasonableness of the fees, you -- you would look more granularly to determine whether the case -- the issues were intertwined or not. If they're completely separate issues and you lost on them, generally, no, you don't get fees for those.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> What do you do with the case that Justice Jackson posed, which is common?  I want to -- I want to participate in this protest, this parade  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and only the passage of time moots the case. You've gotten all your relief. Nothing you've done or someone else has done has changed it. You got all the relief you really wanted. I wanted to protest.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, you did not get relief on the merits. Now I think a lot of the questions have --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> We -- we keep going back to the operative question here, which is we repeatedly said you don't need a final judgment. You don't need a determination o f the merits. You can have a consent judgment. You can have this. There has to be  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> I don't think that's quite</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- a different sense.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- I don't think that's quite right. The legislative history says you don't need a final judgment following a full trial on the merits. That means you can get a final judgment at an earlier stage through summary judgment before you go to trial, through, for instance, a  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's not a final judgment. You get a judgment --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, summary judgment is a final judgment.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Not until you appeal it. Not until the whole case is litigated. You get a judgment but not final judgment.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> If sum  --if the court grants summary judgment, it is a final judgment if it's on all the claims.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's the  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> If it's summary judgment on part of the claims, then it's subject to revision, so it's not truly final. If it's  -- if it's injunctive and you grant summary judgment and then award injunctive relief, well, that's final because you're actually awarding merits relief at that point.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So, for example, the Chief -- Chief Justice's hypothetical, after the parade, I could ask for a trial on the merits in -- in accompanying the PI and a final judgment could be issued at that time?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That happens all the time. It happens from --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It happens  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And  --and --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- but sometimes it doesn't because it's the court --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and sometimes it doesn't because I might want to go ahead and litigate it because I'm concerned about the same thing in the future and I might want, for example, a declaratory judgment, and I -- I could issue  -- I could --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Or the parade may be annual.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It may be annual.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> A lot of these parades are annual parades.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And I want a prospective injunction going forward.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And then we would have a final judgment on the merits  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- on at least that claim on which you would be prevailing, right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct. Correct. And I -- and I also want to address just a more general point, which is some of the questions were like:  Well, the fees have been incurred, we've got to allocate them. You know, who do  we allocate them to?  Well, that's answered by the American rule. The American rule is each party, win or lose, bears their own fees. And this Court has made clear that you need express statutory authority to depart from that rule. And the statutory --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --and isn't that the statute we're talking about here? Right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, the statute uses a term of art that's existed in statutes since at least -- the American statute since at least 1853.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but it is  -- it is addressing -- it is trying, Congress, to give us an exception to the American rule, and the question is what is the scope of that exception.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But Congress didn't go all the way. Congress adopted a term of art which had  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Prevailing party.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- a settled meaning.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask about Justice Gorsuch's example?  What if I don't want to spend the time and additional money to litigate this through to a declaratory judgment or a future?  What if I just want to march in  the parade tomorrow?  I'm a religious organization, for example. I don't  --you know, I agree with traditional marriage, and tomorrow is the LGBTQ parade and I want to march in it. I want to be able to be there. I  -- I'm not making a whole thing out of it.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I -- I get that. I go to court and I argue the merits of my entitlement  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to be able to do that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And the court says, as a preliminary matter, we don't have a whole trial yet, I think you're going to win, so I'm giving you an injunction and you get to march in the parade.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And I do.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then I'm done. I say the case is mooted because, really, the relief that I wanted was the ability to march in the parade tomorrow. But I did have to pay an attorney to be able to convince you, court, to give me the relief that I requested. I --I guess I don't understand why, under our formulation of the test for a prevailing party in the Lefemine case, what we say  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That was a permanent injunction, and --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand it was a permanent injunction in that case, but I'm asking you, we set up a test for when you are a prevailing party, and the question is why doesn't that test also cover preliminary injunctions like the one that I talked about.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Part of that test is a judgment on the merits, and a judge  -- this is not  -- a preliminary injunction is a tentative determination that does not control anything later in the suit. It's only for the PI stage,  only to adjust the parties' relationships during the suit.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Mr. Yang, does any  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And this is important.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Ms. Maley said that she didn't know of a circuit that it accept ed -- that had accepted this categorical position, if it's a preliminary injunction, there are no fees. Do you know of any circuit that's accepted this categorical position?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, that was the Smyth rule prior to.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Yeah, prior to it being changed, and  --and so now --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, but this Court granted cert on unanimous --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- so now there's -- there's a uniform rule. You don't know of anything  --any court that's gone the other way. You know what?  It's an interesting thing. It seems that this comes up all the time, and it seems as though it's come up frequently just in recent years. When I was talking to my clerks about this, you know, several had confronted this issue with respect to COVID litigation, where  people went to courts and they asked for injunctions from various kinds of COVID policies, and then, you know, in the end, those  policies were changed or were scrapped or were abandoned in some way. So it seems as though there's quite a lot of recent law that cuts against you here from circuits, like, pretty much all across the U.S.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the circuits are not uniform. Some of them look to -- for instance, the Fifth Circuit looks to why the -- the mooting event occurred, but my -- my point -- I want to make two points. One, this Court already addressed the strategic mootness question in Buckhannon and  -- and  -- and addressed that in four different factors. There's two other factors. I want to address two of those first and then I'll go to Buckhannon. One is that Congress has struck a balance here, that there is reason for caution before abandoning what this Court has described as the crucial connection between liability for a violation of federal law on the merits, finding on the merits that you violated federal law, and attorney's fees, and there's reason to -- to give pause before doing that. Congress has sometimes been more generous with the government, but these -- this case -- this statute covers both private individuals and non-federal actors. Secondly, going to Buckhannon, the cost  --there's a cost of deterring federal government action from being voluntarily changed when it may be lawful. Litigation often puts a spotlight on a practice that might not be the best policy even though it's lawful, and the Court in Buckhannon recognized there is a cost to deterring that kind of good government change. Secondly --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Okay. I don't think that that's what I was asking about. I was asking really, you know, do you have any law out there on your side?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> We have a term of art that has gone back --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, what  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- in this Court's decisions, and -- and I think that the courts of appeals just have not been faithful to this Court's decisions.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, that  -- that raises the question for me, why -- why do you think they've been not seeing the light?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, I think sometimes there's  -- as a policy matter, you might decide, hey, you know, this  -- this --I don't like this outcome. I think some of the courts  -- and -- and I acknowledge that there might be some cases like that. But that type of policy call is for Congress to make. So, in Buckhannon, when the Court rejected the catalyst theory, Justice Ginsburg dissented and said:  Hey, look, there's one specific area that's really problematic, FOIA. Congress reacted and did a targeted response to This really goes to the appropriate separation of powers here. Congress adopts a  statute that has a term of art that goes back quite some time. This Court has repeatedly  determined that merits determination, you know, a determination of liability on the merits is crucial to then make  --making the defendant liable for fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Congress --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> The Respondents argue that there is a historical background of a venerable equitable tradition of awarding interim costs, including for a preliminary injunction, and that, if accepted, would perhaps undercut your historical argument. Do you want to say something about that?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> There's two points I would love to make about that. First, this -- this Court already resolved that argument in Alyeska Pipeline. There was a  --and it was actually Justice Marshall's dissent, which was based on equitable principles. What the Court decided in Alyeska Pipeline is that the American rule is each party bears its own costs. There are certain discrete common law exceptions that have evolved. At equity, for instance, the common fund exception,  you get a fund. It would be unjustly  -- you would unjustly enrich the people who benefit unless they pay your fees. That's a fee-sharing, not fee-shifting. Bad faith attorney's fees is another one. Contempt fees is another exception. But the Court did not say equity, you know, it's all -- you know, whatever you think is equitable. The Court recognized that there are very discrete limits. And I think that's illustrated by the only case that they cite, the only case that they cite as  --as supporting a PI fee award, and that's Clancy versus Geb. In that case, it was not based on the temporary injunction that was issued on the day the suit was filed. The court said it was based on the trial on the merits that sustained the cause of action for an injunction. Now, after the trial on the merits, the court didn't grant further injunctive relief, and that might be a problem, but it certainly does not  stand for the proposition that a TRO or, you know -- or a PI gets you prevailing party status. There was a final adjudication on the merits of the -- of the cause of action.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Just to be clear, Buckhannon, there was no court -ordered relief whatsoever, correct?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's true. That's true.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as I read the decision, that was mostly the focus of the decision?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, certainly, the catalyst theory was  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It was the prime focus.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- but the catalyst --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- theory does not -- we're not escaping the catalyst theory here because  the catalyst theory is embedded in this case. It is the second -- it is what happened with this case after --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you're  -- you're -- you're claiming there is no catalyst theory because you're saying the legislature acted -- or the other side is saying it acted independently, so it -- it has nothing to do --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the catalyst theory was rejected in Buckhannon.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> They're saying it doesn't matter why the case ends. It just ended with a judgment, dismissal of the action. It could be for mootness. It could be because the other side gave up. I got what I came for at least in part. I got my license back. I drove for 16 months. I didn't have to pay anybody to get my license back. I won for those  --that part of my relief. And it's never been dissolved, reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But that's not what the term ""prevailing party"" has been understood, either by this Court or by the dictionary definitions that date back from before the -- the  -- the 20th Century. That has required a final adjudication  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well, that's the problem. No, it's never required a final adjudication. It's required a judgment but not a final one.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it has. I mean, even  --even the legislative history -- this Court in Hanrahan discussed the legislative history. It's all in dicta, but it discussed the legislative history of Section 1988, and what  --the conclusion the Court drew was that interim fees, meaning before the case is finally over, only -- were available only when the party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of its claims. And that happens when you get a final determination, maybe not a final judgment because you're not resolving all claims or maybe because there's some ongoing litigation about the nature of the injunctive relief.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Yang. We -- we have a difference of opinion on what finality means. If all you're seeking  is a preliminary injunction, that's final for that purpose.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> You don't  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That  -- that's the problem we're having.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --file suits for preliminary injunctions. You file suits for  equitable relief, a judgment at the end of the suit. A preliminary injunction is a preliminary matter that protects the parties while the suit is adjudicated.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Let me see if I've got it. So a PI can't be the basis for a  --a -- an award of fees under this statute because Sole basically says you have to look at what happens afterwards. And for all the reasons you just gave, a PI is a PI. It's preliminary. It's not  --okay. All right. Fine. Now  -- so we have to look what happened afterwards. And, here, what happened afterwards is plaintiffs may well have convinced  the Virginia state legislature to change their mind in a catalyst sort of way.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> The problem is Buckhannon says that doesn't work either.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. But Justice Ginsburg in Buckhannon says, hey, Congress should fix that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And Congress did fix it in FOIA --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yep.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and said involuntary  -- voluntary cessation and changes, you still get fees. But --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So long as it's not an insubstantial claim.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So quite generous, with the government's money, of course. You know, it's quite different when we're talking about privat e litigants and non-federal. I think Congress might be more reticent to creating such a generous departure from even the prevailing party standard, but it could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And it hasn't here.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> End of case. That's your theory of the case?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's our theory.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. Got it.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I think, when the red light went on, you were in the middle of a really brilliant answer about Buckhannon. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And do you want to finish that answer?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Like a  --like a preliminary injunction, it was fleeting. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And I'm not sure that I recall the brilliance that was --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, I will look at the transcript and fill it in, so okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the  -- you know, I was just going to try to talk about strategic mootness maybe a little bit. Maybe that's where  we were going. And, you know --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Sure.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- strategic mootness, as my  -- my  --my colleague has already answered, you've got a voluntary cessation barrier, which, you know, in your decision in Fikre, Justice Gorsuch, it's a pretty formidable burden.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I hope so. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it -- it's a formidable burden. Damages awards, never going to moot out. And it's entirely speculative what effect this is going to have. That's what Buckhannon said. Like, it's not speculative whether it's going to deter counsel or not. And I think this illustrates that. There's no data to show this. This case was started when Smyth was the rule. They had no reason to expect any attorney's fees from a PI, but they took the case. So it's a little hard to say, like, there's this compelling case that, like, we're going to have a  -- a --a crash in civil rights, civil rights era. And there's a real cost, again, to determining  -- to deterring the government from changing course when the action might be lawful but bad policy.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. That's good enough. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So here's the problem that I'm having with your statement of the case as you summarized with Justice Gorsuch. It's that it begins with Sole says that a PI doesn't count because you have to look at what happens afterwards. I'm reading from Sole. ""We express no view on whether, in the absence of a final decision on the merits of a claim for permanent relief, success in gaining a preliminary injunction may sometimes warrant an award of counsel fees.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So I don't know how you can start your case with the premise that Sole stands for the proposition that if you win a preliminary injunction, you have to get to final judgment in order to be entitled to  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it's true  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- counsel fees.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --that the Court reserved that, but the Court also did say that it recognized that a preliminary injunction was just the initial salvo. As I stated in my intro, it's  -- the tentative character makes a fee request at that initial stage premature.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It did not say ""premature.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It says, ""Wyner is not a prevailing party, we conclude, for her initial victory was ephemeral.""  And it was ephemeral in that case because it happened to go on and get reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It's on page 84 of the Court's opinion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> ""The tentative  character would have made the fee request at this initial stage premature.""</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> ""The tentative character"" --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Of the PI.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- ""would have made"" -- yes, but it also says:  ""We express no view as to whether or not that tentative character in  PI is enough to make you a prevailing party.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Agreed, but I think it goes halfway there, and Buckhannon closes the door on that  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- because --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>Anthony A.

I welcome the Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Do you think that the statutes in which Congress requires that there be a final order before you can -- before you can have a prevailing party, do you think that's just simply superfluous?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No. No, I don't  --I don't. There's only one statute, by the way, that predates Section 1988. It's Section 1617, which is discussed by the Court in Bradley. All  that does is clarifies that you don't need a true final judgment that ends the case. A final judgment normally is one that resolves all  claims and ceases to terminate -- terminates the case. In the context of -- of Section 1617, that's in the context of school desegregation injunctive orders, and in that context, you often will have a final order, which is a  -- you know, even if it doesn't resolve all claims, but it's final, it's on the merits, you're granting relief on the merits, but the injunction may need to be tweaked as we go along because just any kind of complicated institutional injunction is going to have to be tweaked. That's all Section 1617 requires. It does not depart -- it does not change the normal understanding of ""prevailing party,"" which a prevailing party is one who succeeds at the end of the case because they obtain judgment on at least one claim.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Counsel  --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say, if I understand it, you don't have to get final judgment on all the claims, right?  You just need to prevail on one. Now, if you prevail on  one, can you get the attorney fees that are associated with 2, 3, and 4?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No. The question -- there's multiple questions in attorney's fees cases. The first is whether you're a prevailing party. You have to succeed on at least one claim on the merits to be prevailing.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> The question then goes to how much fees. That's a  --usually, it's a reasonable fee award. And the reasonableness of the fees, you -- you would look more granularly to determine whether the case -- the issues were intertwined or not. If they're completely separate issues and you lost on them, generally, no, you don't get fees for those.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> What do you do with the case that Justice Jackson posed, which is common?  I want to -- I want to participate in this protest, this parade  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and only the passage of time moots the case. You've gotten all your relief. Nothing you've done or someone else has done has changed it. You got all the relief you really wanted. I wanted to protest.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, you did not get relief on the merits. Now I think a lot of the questions have --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> We -- we keep going back to the operative question here, which is we repeatedly said you don't need a final judgment. You don't need a determination o f the merits. You can have a consent judgment. You can have this. There has to be  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> I don't think that's quite</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- a different sense.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- I don't think that's quite right. The legislative history says you don't need a final judgment following a full trial on the merits. That means you can get a final judgment at an earlier stage through summary judgment before you go to trial, through, for instance, a  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's not a final judgment. You get a judgment --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, summary judgment is a final judgment.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Not until you appeal it. Not until the whole case is litigated. You get a judgment but not final judgment.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> If sum  --if the court grants summary judgment, it is a final judgment if it's on all the claims.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That's the  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> If it's summary judgment on part of the claims, then it's subject to revision, so it's not truly final. If it's  -- if it's injunctive and you grant summary judgment and then award injunctive relief, well, that's final because you're actually awarding merits relief at that point.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So, for example, the Chief -- Chief Justice's hypothetical, after the parade, I could ask for a trial on the merits in -- in accompanying the PI and a final judgment could be issued at that time?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That happens all the time. It happens from --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It happens  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And  --and --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- but sometimes it doesn't because it's the court --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and sometimes it doesn't because I might want to go ahead and litigate it because I'm concerned about the same thing in the future and I might want, for example, a declaratory judgment, and I -- I could issue  -- I could --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Or the parade may be annual.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It may be annual.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> A lot of these parades are annual parades.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And I want a prospective injunction going forward.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And then we would have a final judgment on the merits  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- on at least that claim on which you would be prevailing, right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct. Correct. And I -- and I also want to address just a more general point, which is some of the questions were like:  Well, the fees have been incurred, we've got to allocate them. You know, who do  we allocate them to?  Well, that's answered by the American rule. The American rule is each party, win or lose, bears their own fees. And this Court has made clear that you need express statutory authority to depart from that rule. And the statutory --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --and isn't that the statute we're talking about here? Right?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yes, the statute uses a term of art that's existed in statutes since at least -- the American statute since at least 1853.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but it is  -- it is addressing -- it is trying, Congress, to give us an exception to the American rule, and the question is what is the scope of that exception.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But Congress didn't go all the way. Congress adopted a term of art which had  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Prevailing party.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- a settled meaning.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask about Justice Gorsuch's example?  What if I don't want to spend the time and additional money to litigate this through to a declaratory judgment or a future?  What if I just want to march in  the parade tomorrow?  I'm a religious organization, for example. I don't  --you know, I agree with traditional marriage, and tomorrow is the LGBTQ parade and I want to march in it. I want to be able to be there. I  -- I'm not making a whole thing out of it.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I -- I get that. I go to court and I argue the merits of my entitlement  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to be able to do that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And the court says, as a preliminary matter, we don't have a whole trial yet, I think you're going to win, so I'm giving you an injunction and you get to march in the parade.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And I do.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then I'm done. I say the case is mooted because, really, the relief that I wanted was the ability to march in the parade tomorrow. But I did have to pay an attorney to be able to convince you, court, to give me the relief that I requested. I --I guess I don't understand why, under our formulation of the test for a prevailing party in the Lefemine case, what we say  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That was a permanent injunction, and --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand it was a permanent injunction in that case, but I'm asking you, we set up a test for when you are a prevailing party, and the question is why doesn't that test also cover preliminary injunctions like the one that I talked about.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Part of that test is a judgment on the merits, and a judge  -- this is not  -- a preliminary injunction is a tentative determination that does not control anything later in the suit. It's only for the PI stage,  only to adjust the parties' relationships during the suit.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Mr. Yang, does any  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And this is important.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Ms. Maley said that she didn't know of a circuit that it accept ed -- that had accepted this categorical position, if it's a preliminary injunction, there are no fees. Do you know of any circuit that's accepted this categorical position?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, that was the Smyth rule prior to.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Yeah, prior to it being changed, and  --and so now --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, but this Court granted cert on unanimous --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- so now there's -- there's a uniform rule. You don't know of anything  --any court that's gone the other way. You know what?  It's an interesting thing. It seems that this comes up all the time, and it seems as though it's come up frequently just in recent years. When I was talking to my clerks about this, you know, several had confronted this issue with respect to COVID litigation, where  people went to courts and they asked for injunctions from various kinds of COVID policies, and then, you know, in the end, those  policies were changed or were scrapped or were abandoned in some way. So it seems as though there's quite a lot of recent law that cuts against you here from circuits, like, pretty much all across the U.S.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the circuits are not uniform. Some of them look to -- for instance, the Fifth Circuit looks to why the -- the mooting event occurred, but my -- my point -- I want to make two points. One, this Court already addressed the strategic mootness question in Buckhannon and  -- and  -- and addressed that in four different factors. There's two other factors. I want to address two of those first and then I'll go to Buckhannon. One is that Congress has struck a balance here, that there is reason for caution before abandoning what this Court has described as the crucial connection between liability for a violation of federal law on the merits, finding on the merits that you violated federal law, and attorney's fees, and there's reason to -- to give pause before doing that. Congress has sometimes been more generous with the government, but these -- this case -- this statute covers both private individuals and non-federal actors. Secondly, going to Buckhannon, the cost  --there's a cost of deterring federal government action from being voluntarily changed when it may be lawful. Litigation often puts a spotlight on a practice that might not be the best policy even though it's lawful, and the Court in Buckhannon recognized there is a cost to deterring that kind of good government change. Secondly --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Okay. I don't think that that's what I was asking about. I was asking really, you know, do you have any law out there on your side?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> We have a term of art that has gone back --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, what  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- in this Court's decisions, and -- and I think that the courts of appeals just have not been faithful to this Court's decisions.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, that  -- that raises the question for me, why -- why do you think they've been not seeing the light?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, I think sometimes there's  -- as a policy matter, you might decide, hey, you know, this  -- this --I don't like this outcome. I think some of the courts  -- and -- and I acknowledge that there might be some cases like that. But that type of policy call is for Congress to make. So, in Buckhannon, when the Court rejected the catalyst theory, Justice Ginsburg dissented and said:  Hey, look, there's one specific area that's really problematic, FOIA. Congress reacted and did a targeted response to This really goes to the appropriate separation of powers here. Congress adopts a  statute that has a term of art that goes back quite some time. This Court has repeatedly  determined that merits determination, you know, a determination of liability on the merits is crucial to then make  --making the defendant liable for fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Congress --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> The Respondents argue that there is a historical background of a venerable equitable tradition of awarding interim costs, including for a preliminary injunction, and that, if accepted, would perhaps undercut your historical argument. Do you want to say something about that?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> There's two points I would love to make about that. First, this -- this Court already resolved that argument in Alyeska Pipeline. There was a  --and it was actually Justice Marshall's dissent, which was based on equitable principles. What the Court decided in Alyeska Pipeline is that the American rule is each party bears its own costs. There are certain discrete common law exceptions that have evolved. At equity, for instance, the common fund exception,  you get a fund. It would be unjustly  -- you would unjustly enrich the people who benefit unless they pay your fees. That's a fee-sharing, not fee-shifting. Bad faith attorney's fees is another one. Contempt fees is another exception. But the Court did not say equity, you know, it's all -- you know, whatever you think is equitable. The Court recognized that there are very discrete limits. And I think that's illustrated by the only case that they cite, the only case that they cite as  --as supporting a PI fee award, and that's Clancy versus Geb. In that case, it was not based on the temporary injunction that was issued on the day the suit was filed. The court said it was based on the trial on the merits that sustained the cause of action for an injunction. Now, after the trial on the merits, the court didn't grant further injunctive relief, and that might be a problem, but it certainly does not  stand for the proposition that a TRO or, you know -- or a PI gets you prevailing party status. There was a final adjudication on the merits of the -- of the cause of action.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Just to be clear, Buckhannon, there was no court -ordered relief whatsoever, correct?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's true. That's true.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as I read the decision, that was mostly the focus of the decision?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, certainly, the catalyst theory was  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It was the prime focus.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- but the catalyst --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> All right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- theory does not -- we're not escaping the catalyst theory here because  the catalyst theory is embedded in this case. It is the second -- it is what happened with this case after --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you're  -- you're -- you're claiming there is no catalyst theory because you're saying the legislature acted -- or the other side is saying it acted independently, so it -- it has nothing to do --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the catalyst theory was rejected in Buckhannon.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> They're saying it doesn't matter why the case ends. It just ended with a judgment, dismissal of the action. It could be for mootness. It could be because the other side gave up. I got what I came for at least in part. I got my license back. I drove for 16 months. I didn't have to pay anybody to get my license back. I won for those  --that part of my relief. And it's never been dissolved, reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> But that's not what the term ""prevailing party"" has been understood, either by this Court or by the dictionary definitions that date back from before the -- the  -- the 20th Century. That has required a final adjudication  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Well, that's the problem. No, it's never required a final adjudication. It's required a judgment but not a final one.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it has. I mean, even  --even the legislative history -- this Court in Hanrahan discussed the legislative history. It's all in dicta, but it discussed the legislative history of Section 1988, and what  --the conclusion the Court drew was that interim fees, meaning before the case is finally over, only -- were available only when the party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of its claims. And that happens when you get a final determination, maybe not a final judgment because you're not resolving all claims or maybe because there's some ongoing litigation about the nature of the injunctive relief.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Yang. We -- we have a difference of opinion on what finality means. If all you're seeking  is a preliminary injunction, that's final for that purpose.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> You don't  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> That  -- that's the problem we're having.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --file suits for preliminary injunctions. You file suits for  equitable relief, a judgment at the end of the suit. A preliminary injunction is a preliminary matter that protects the parties while the suit is adjudicated.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Let me see if I've got it. So a PI can't be the basis for a  --a -- an award of fees under this statute because Sole basically says you have to look at what happens afterwards. And for all the reasons you just gave, a PI is a PI. It's preliminary. It's not  --okay. All right. Fine. Now  -- so we have to look what happened afterwards. And, here, what happened afterwards is plaintiffs may well have convinced  the Virginia state legislature to change their mind in a catalyst sort of way.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> The problem is Buckhannon says that doesn't work either.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Correct.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. But Justice Ginsburg in Buckhannon says, hey, Congress should fix that.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And Congress did fix it in FOIA --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Yep.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- and said involuntary  -- voluntary cessation and changes, you still get fees. But --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So long as it's not an insubstantial claim.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> So quite generous, with the government's money, of course. You know, it's quite different when we're talking about privat e litigants and non-federal. I think Congress might be more reticent to creating such a generous departure from even the prevailing party standard, but it could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It could.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> And it hasn't here.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> End of case. That's your theory of the case?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> That's our theory.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> All right. Got it.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kavanaugh?</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> I think, when the red light went on, you were in the middle of a really brilliant answer about Buckhannon. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And do you want to finish that answer?</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Like a  --like a preliminary injunction, it was fleeting. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> And I'm not sure that I recall the brilliance that was --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Well, I will look at the transcript and fill it in, so okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, the  -- you know, I was just going to try to talk about strategic mootness maybe a little bit. Maybe that's where  we were going. And, you know --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Sure.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- strategic mootness, as my  -- my  --my colleague has already answered, you've got a voluntary cessation barrier, which, you know, in your decision in Fikre, Justice Gorsuch, it's a pretty formidable burden.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I hope so. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it -- it's a formidable burden. Damages awards, never going to moot out. And it's entirely speculative what effect this is going to have. That's what Buckhannon said. Like, it's not speculative whether it's going to deter counsel or not. And I think this illustrates that. There's no data to show this. This case was started when Smyth was the rule. They had no reason to expect any attorney's fees from a PI, but they took the case. So it's a little hard to say, like, there's this compelling case that, like, we're going to have a  -- a --a crash in civil rights, civil rights era. And there's a real cost, again, to determining  -- to deterring the government from changing course when the action might be lawful but bad policy.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Okay. That's good enough. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So here's the problem that I'm having with your statement of the case as you summarized with Justice Gorsuch. It's that it begins with Sole says that a PI doesn't count because you have to look at what happens afterwards. I'm reading from Sole. ""We express no view on whether, in the absence of a final decision on the merits of a claim for permanent relief, success in gaining a preliminary injunction may sometimes warrant an award of counsel fees.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So I don't know how you can start your case with the premise that Sole stands for the proposition that if you win a preliminary injunction, you have to get to final judgment in order to be entitled to  --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Well, it's true  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- counsel fees.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> --that the Court reserved that, but the Court also did say that it recognized that a preliminary injunction was just the initial salvo. As I stated in my intro, it's  -- the tentative character makes a fee request at that initial stage premature.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It did not say ""premature.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It  -- it --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> It says, ""Wyner is not a prevailing party, we conclude, for her initial victory was ephemeral.""  And it was ephemeral in that case because it happened to go on and get reversed.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> It's on page 84 of the Court's opinion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> ""The tentative  character would have made the fee request at this initial stage premature.""</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> ""The tentative character"" --</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Of the PI.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- ""would have made"" -- yes, but it also says:  ""We express no view as to whether or not that tentative character in  PI is enough to make you a prevailing party.""</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> Agreed, but I think it goes halfway there, and Buckhannon closes the door on that  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text> -- because --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>Anthony A.

I look forward to this Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You --can a consent decree or a default judgment support a prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion.

2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Yes and no. I mean, you know, if you -- let me give you a hypothetical and -- and let's take it out of this state context. Let's just say there are two neighbors, and one of them is pouring pollutants into a stream that goes onto the other neighbor's property, right?  And so the injured neighbor sues and he sues for a permanent injunction, but, first, he sues for a preliminary injunction. And a preliminary injunction is gotten, all right?  He gets  --he gets  -- and -- and -- and for the next three years, while the court decides the case, he has a very valuable thing, which is the neighbor has not been able to pour pollutants into his stream anymore, right?  But then the court changes its mind and the court says we're not going to grant the permanent injunction, right?  And -- and the -- the plaintiff says, well, I got something really significant. I got three years' worth of a -- of a preliminary injunction and that was fantastic. So I should get fees for that, the same way I get fees for winning one claim out of three, right?

Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L.

And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang.

2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Okay. Now let's say there is no permanent injunction because the  neighbor dies or, you know, the stream goes dry, all right, and so all that's left is the preliminary injunction. The court could have done the same thing, you know, if it had gotten to the permanent injunction, which is to say no, but something just sort of fortuitous has happened to stop the case. Why does the -- why does the analysis change?","<speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The prevailing party is the party who wins the lawsuit, obtaining a final judgment in its favor, or at least a party who obtains a ruling that the defendant is liable on the merits of one or more claims, such as a summary judgment or a judgment as a matter of law. A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds. It provid es no enduring relief. By its nature, it is a temporary procedural order that dissolves upon final judgment. A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies. Legal dictionaries at the time Congress enacted Section 1988 defined  ""prevailing party"" based on whether the party had successfully maintained its claim, looking to the end of the suit, not on its degree of success at earlier stages. This Court's precedent similarly provides that liability for fees and liability on the merits go hand in hand. The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party.

And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L.

I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG</text>",coherent
2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," Well, he hasn't, because he did go to court to get the permanent thing. I mean, the preliminary injunction was a  kind of way station on the way to getting the permanent thing. But what he really wanted -- this is not the single parade, right?  What he really wanted was for you never  --for that stream that  -- those pollutants never to bother him. And, essentially, what Sole says is: Because you didn't get that, you don't get that way station re lief, right? And so  -- so I'm just sort of suggesting that take out the final determination and just say:  We never get to the final determination because of some fortuity. Why does all of a sudden he get the award for the way station?","<speaker>Erika L.

A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds. It provid es no enduring relief. By its nature, it is a temporary procedural order that dissolves upon final judgment. A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies. Legal dictionaries at the time Congress enacted Section 1988 defined  ""prevailing party"" based on whether the party had successfully maintained its claim, looking to the end of the suit, not on its degree of success at earlier stages. This Court's precedent similarly provides that liability for fees and liability on the merits go hand in hand. The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party.

I look forward to this Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You --can a consent decree or a default judgment support a prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?

Now the -- the court has not adjudicated in a final way anybody's rights with respect to anything. And I didn't get the relief I came to court seeking.

Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one.

And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G.

2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Counsel, I'd like to talk about the prevailing party for a minute. I mean, when you get a PI, you're not the prevailing party. The court has made a predictive judgment that you'll probably be the prevailing party, you know, and some circuits are still using this sliding scale. You know, you can't disregard the merits un der Winter, but, you know, you might have gotten the preliminary injunction because the equities were really strong, because maybe the pollution is running onto your property. And, I mean, I have not been a district judge, but, as someone who's dealt with our emergency docket, you know, you are making  those kinds of preliminary judgments in a -- in a very compressed time frame and it's like a 51 percent, like, as you showed, a reasonable likelihood of success. Why is that prevailing because a district court has made that judgment on a PI?","<speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The prevailing party is the party who wins the lawsuit, obtaining a final judgment in its favor, or at least a party who obtains a ruling that the defendant is liable on the merits of one or more claims, such as a summary judgment or a judgment as a matter of law. A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds. It provid es no enduring relief. By its nature, it is a temporary procedural order that dissolves upon final judgment. A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies.

Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang.

Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG</text>",coherent
2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr."," All right. When there's not a state defendant then and you had a claim -- and the party has a claim for nominal  damages, but what it really wants is a preliminary injunction?  It gets the preliminary injunction, and then the case is litigated on the issue of whether the party's entitled to nominal damages. And at that point, the court changes its mind and says:  My interpretation of the law was incorrect when I issued the preliminary injunction. Then what happens?","<speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The prevailing party is the party who wins the lawsuit, obtaining a final judgment in its favor, or at least a party who obtains a ruling that the defendant is liable on the merits of one or more claims, such as a summary judgment or a judgment as a matter of law. A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds. It provid es no enduring relief. By its nature, it is a temporary procedural order that dissolves upon final judgment. A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies. Legal dictionaries at the time Congress enacted Section 1988 defined  ""prevailing party"" based on whether the party had successfully maintained its claim, looking to the end of the suit, not on its degree of success at earlier stages. This Court's precedent similarly provides that liability for fees and liability on the merits go hand in hand. The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party. I look forward to this Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> We'll hear argument next in Case 23-621, Lackey versus Stinnie. Ms. Maley.</text><speaker>Erika L.

I look forward to this Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You --can a consent decree or a default judgment support a prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief.

And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG</text>",coherent
2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh, Can you address the idea that the American rule should be a firm background principle and should  --we should require Congress to speak especially clearly when it wants to deviate from that and including the scope of how much Congress wants to deviate?,"<speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The prevailing party is the party who wins the lawsuit, obtaining a final judgment in its favor, or at least a party who obtains a ruling that the defendant is liable on the merits of one or more claims, such as a summary judgment or a judgment as a matter of law. A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds. It provid es no enduring relief. By its nature, it is a temporary procedural order that dissolves upon final judgment. A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies. Legal dictionaries at the time Congress enacted Section 1988 defined  ""prevailing party"" based on whether the party had successfully maintained its claim, looking to the end of the suit, not on its degree of success at earlier stages. This Court's precedent similarly provides that liability for fees and liability on the merits go hand in hand. The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party. I look forward to this Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> We'll hear argument next in Case 23-621, Lackey versus Stinnie. Ms. Maley.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The prevailing party is the party who wins the lawsuit, obtaining a final judgment in its favor, or at least a party who obtains a ruling that the defendant is liable on the merits of one or more claims, such as a summary judgment or a judgment as a matter of law. A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law.

The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party. I look forward to this Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You --can a consent decree or a default judgment support a prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure.

Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?

Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L.

So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L.

Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG</text>",coherent
2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Is  -- is another way to address the Chief Justice's question that what we're looking for is whet her you are entitled to prevailing party status and that you can be deemed a prevailing party, you  --in your view, based on a preliminary injunction when you can  -- maybe sometimes you can't, you're -- you're -- you're not saying you always are -- you're just saying reject the statement that you can never be. So sometimes a preliminary win can confer prevailing party status, but the actual award of the fees that you would get happens when the case is over. At the end of the day, then the court goes back and we look how much attorney's time was put into it. As Justice Sotomayor points out, it's a  --you know, was it a reasonable fee request for that work that went into the PI?","<speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The prevailing party is the party who wins the lawsuit, obtaining a final judgment in its favor, or at least a party who obtains a ruling that the defendant is liable on the merits of one or more claims, such as a summary judgment or a judgment as a matter of law. A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds. It provid es no enduring relief. By its nature, it is a temporary procedural order that dissolves upon final judgment. A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies. Legal dictionaries at the time Congress enacted Section 1988 defined  ""prevailing party"" based on whether the party had successfully maintained its claim, looking to the end of the suit, not on its degree of success at earlier stages. This Court's precedent similarly provides that liability for fees and liability on the merits go hand in hand. The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party.

Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor.

Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang.

2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," And  --and you can be divested.

A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds.

I look forward to this Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You --can a consent decree or a default judgment support a prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons.

I look forward to this Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You --can a consent decree or a default judgment support a prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A.

Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion.

Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?

Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang.

2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.", Any other type of relief doesn't count as prevailing?,"<speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The prevailing party is the party who wins the lawsuit, obtaining a final judgment in its favor, or at least a party who obtains a ruling that the defendant is liable on the merits of one or more claims, such as a summary judgment or a judgment as a matter of law. A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds. It provid es no enduring relief. By its nature, it is a temporary procedural order that dissolves upon final judgment. A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies. Legal dictionaries at the time Congress enacted Section 1988 defined  ""prevailing party"" based on whether the party had successfully maintained its claim, looking to the end of the suit, not on its degree of success at earlier stages. This Court's precedent similarly provides that liability for fees and liability on the merits go hand in hand. The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party.

I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win.

Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons.

And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing.

Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG</text>",coherent
2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch," At the end -- so we do have to look at the end of the case and see what the court said at the end of the case, right?","<speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The prevailing party is the party who wins the lawsuit, obtaining a final judgment in its favor, or at least a party who obtains a ruling that the defendant is liable on the merits of one or more claims, such as a summary judgment or a judgment as a matter of law. A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds. It provid es no enduring relief. By its nature, it is a temporary procedural order that dissolves upon final judgment. A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies. Legal dictionaries at the time Congress enacted Section 1988 defined  ""prevailing party"" based on whether the party had successfully maintained its claim, looking to the end of the suit, not on its degree of success at earlier stages. This Court's precedent similarly provides that liability for fees and liability on the merits go hand in hand. The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party. I look forward to this Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> We'll hear argument next in Case 23-621, Lackey versus Stinnie. Ms. Maley.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The prevailing party is the party who wins the lawsuit, obtaining a final judgment in its favor, or at least a party who obtains a ruling that the defendant is liable on the merits of one or more claims, such as a summary judgment or a judgment as a matter of law.

The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party. I look forward to this Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You --can a consent decree or a default judgment support a prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L.

And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G.

If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A.

I look forward to this Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You --can a consent decree or a default judgment support a prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?

A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds. It provid es no enduring relief. By its nature, it is a temporary procedural order that dissolves upon final judgment. A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies. Legal dictionaries at the time Congress enacted Section 1988 defined  ""prevailing party"" based on whether the party had successfully maintained its claim, looking to the end of the suit, not on its degree of success at earlier stages. This Court's precedent similarly provides that liability for fees and liability on the merits go hand in hand. The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party. I look forward to this Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You --can a consent decree or a default judgment support a prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. And, like Justice Sotomayor, I don't understand why a preliminary injunction couldn't satisfy that standard.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Because a preliminary injunction is not a determination on the merits</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it is.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- of a claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> When you think about the difference between merits determination and non-merits determinations, we're talking about determinations of, you know, preliminary threshold issues like jurisdiction, right?  A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It touches on the merits, certainly, Justice Jackson --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang.

2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," Just as a recap, what's your definition of ""prevailing party""?","<speaker>Erika L.

But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.

A jurisdictional determination is not a determination on the merits. That's what we've said. But, to the extent that under Winter the preliminary injunction touches on what the court thinks about the merits of the actual legal claim, it is making a determination. Now  it's not a final determination on the merits, but it is a determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L.

Maley</speaker><text> -- but it's not a determination of the merits.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But you got relief based on the court's initial determination on the merits.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> No, but the essential purpose of a preliminary injunction is not to provide a remedy for a violation of a law but to protect the court's ability to grant effective relief at the close of the case.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> What about the Chief Justice's example?  In that situation, the absolute purpose is:  The parade is tomorrow, and what I want to do is I want to be in it, says this group. I need a PI.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Certainly, in that circumstance, if a party chose to seek a consolidation of the merits with a preliminary injunction under Rule 65(a)(2), then there would be an actual determination about whether the defendant had or hadn't violated federal law,  and that could then qualify. But, otherwise, if you imagine in Sole, for instance, that the plaintiff there had  only wanted to hold the one demonstration, then, under that theory, the plaintiff would have been the prevailing party. She wanted to --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But didn't Sole open -- leave open that  --that very question?  I thought Sole was about whether parties can be divested of their prevailing party  status if, eventually, it goes on and the court says no, you did not win. But, in the interim, you know, if they win the preliminary injunction, at that moment, they're a prevailing party and they continue to be unless and until they are reversed in a sense by the final judgment?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Sole did leave that question open, Justice Jackson, but it also said that the temporary, fleeting relief was insufficient and that enduring relief was necessary. And when that's combined with Buckhannon, which holds that that enduring relief has to come from the court, then a preliminary injunction that's dissolved because a case is mooted by a non-judicial alteration, here, the Virginia legislature deciding to  repeal the statute, does not qualify to make the plaintiff a prevailing party.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Suppose that in  -- the litigation on the issue of a preliminary injunction is very  -- is very extensive, lots and lots of attorney hours are -- are burned up, and at the end of all that, the -- the district court issues a preliminary injunction and makes factual findings that are going to be hard to reverse on appeal. And then the government says:  Wow, we've  -- you know, we're facing the potential of a really heavy hit of attorney's fees, so let's just throw in the towel and change the rule or whatever is being challenged.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In a lot of cases, Justice Alito, the -- the case is not going to become moot for a number of reasons. Even if the government changes its conduct prospectively, the voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct is not typically going to moot a case under the voluntary cessation exception to mootness. And if the government wants to overcome that, it has to meet a demanding  standard, as this Court recently held in the Fikre case. In many instances, civil rights  suits, the plaintiffs can also seek damages, and that is also not going to be mooted by a change in the rule going forward. So a lot of the time, the defendant may well, after a preliminary injunction, if it concludes that its further factual development, further legal development is unlikely to change that analysis, the defendant may well then say: Well, I better settle or the fees are going to simply keep accruing. But it's not the case that a government can simply decide at any stage of a case that it wants to moot it and --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, didn't the statute render the case moot?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The statute did render the case moot.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and -- and couldn't a state do that, you know, on -- with respect to all kinds of different cases?  I mean, we had a case a couple  of years ago, New York State gun regulation. You can imagine that sort of thing. It  -- it wasn't the case in that that a preliminary injunction was issued, but imagine that it had been, and then New York State changes its gun law and it leaves everybody kind of high and dry, even  though they've won the only thing that's been at issue and maybe after very extensive litigation, as Justice Alito suggested?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Kagan. First, a legislature's decision to repeal a statute shouldn't be considered a form of gamesmanship. Among other things, the legislature is not the defendant in a civil rights suit. The defendant is an executive . The legislature is a separate and independent branch of government. And the defendant has no control over whether the legislature decides to act or when the legislature decides to act. In addition, even a legislative change is not always going to moot a case. Indeed, the -- the dissenting justices in the New York rifle case set forth a number of reasons to believe that case as a whole was not moot, including the availability of damages and the fact that the legislative change may not have completely resolved the plaintiffs' claims there, even though this Court found it more appropriate to remand given the way the legislative change had changed the questions presented that the Court had initially granted.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> I  --I think the problem that I'm having is with your evading the essence of the question, which is that the money has been spent, and the issue is who bears the cost of that expenditure. And why should it be a plaintiff who has received relief, all the relief that he or she wanted, and is now stuck with paying for that when it was the other side and one of its agents, whether agents or co-legislative body or executive body, who gives up and changes a regulation, decides to make a change?  Why shouldn't the plaintiff receive some recompense, assuming, by the way, that they have done enough to receive it?  I mean, one of the things about prevailing party is that it's not automatically granted. There's discretion  in the courts, and the courts decide how much effort you really put into this and adjust the fees according to those factors.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A few responses to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, it's not correct to say that the plaint iffs received all the relief they wanted from the court. They received all the relief they wanted from the legislature's repeal of the statute from the  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> No, they -- they -- but we've -- we've said that you can get a dollar in nominal damages. So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG</text>",coherent
2024.23-621-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, Is there any other interlocutory relief that could support a  prevailing party other than preliminary injunction?,"<speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The prevailing party is the party who wins the lawsuit, obtaining a final judgment in its favor, or at least a party who obtains a ruling that the defendant is liable on the merits of one or more claims, such as a summary judgment or a judgment as a matter of law. A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds. It provid es no enduring relief. By its nature, it is a temporary procedural order that dissolves upon final judgment. A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies. Legal dictionaries at the time Congress enacted Section 1988 defined  ""prevailing party"" based on whether the party had successfully maintained its claim, looking to the end of the suit, not on its degree of success at earlier stages. This Court's precedent similarly provides that liability for fees and liability on the merits go hand in hand. The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party. I look forward to this Court's questions.</text>","<speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> We'll hear argument next in Case 23-621, Lackey versus Stinnie. Ms. Maley.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The prevailing party is the party who wins the lawsuit, obtaining a final judgment in its favor, or at least a party who obtains a ruling that the defendant is liable on the merits of one or more claims, such as a summary judgment or a judgment as a matter of law. A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds.

The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party. I look forward to this Court's questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> You --can a consent decree or a default judgment support a prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Yes, I think so, Justice Thomas. Under this Court's precedent, the Court  held in Maher that a consent decree qualifies. And it suggested in Kirtsaeng that a default judgment would also qualify. And a default judgment and a consent decree are similar in that they're both situations where the court has not ruled on the merits, but, because the defendant has waived or forfeited a challenge to the merits, the court nonetheless enters a final judgment in the plaintiff's favor.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> But I thought your argument hinged on a court ruling in favor of  -- on the merits in favor of the prevailing party?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> For an interlocutory ruling, that's correct, Justice Thomas. B ut it's either an interlocutory ruling or a favorable final judgment. If a party has a favorable final judgment, it has won the lawsuit, and, thus, it falls within the definition of a ""prevailing party"" for that reason.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> What do you do with the formulation by your friend which is the question is whether they got as much relief as they needed?  I wonder why that doesn't fit under the ""prevailing party"" language.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I don't --</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> In other words, I don't know what that would be. Like, they're  -- they want to do a parade tomorrow. They get a preliminary injunction. The parade goes forward. And they haven't gotten a final judgment, but they don't need a final judgment.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of respo nses to that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it's not sufficient for an interlocutory order because there's been no determination that the defendant has violated federal law or that the plaintiff's claim actually succeeds on the merits. And, second, at least certainly in a situation such as this one, the plaintiffs got what they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what they wanted because the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. So they didn't ultimately get the relief that they wanted from the court. And  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Oh, but they did. They got interim relief. They had their licenses restored, and they had it restored  without paying a fee, and they drove around, despite the existence of the statute, for I think 16 or 18 months, whatever it was. So it was -- it was final. It was never reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone  by a final decision, which is all that Sole said. And we have never required a final judgment. In at least two cases, Hanrahan and  Texas State Teachers, we said you can award interim fees. So final judgment has never been required. All  that's required is did you get a judgment in your favor or relief in your favor that hasn't been reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> A couple of points  in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, Hanrahan did say that interim fees could be available, but it said only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims because only in that circumstance has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties, which Congress concluded was necessary to  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But I don't know why a preliminary injunction doesn't do that because, under Winter, we have recently said that there has to be a finding of a likelihood of success on the merits. So there's been a  finding of likely success on the merits, and there's been relief granted.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So that's the only thing that's required by law to get that relief. That's winning on the merits of a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Under Winter, a party does have to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but, as the Court said in Camenisch, it's improper to equate a likelihood of success on the merits with actual success on the merits both because substantively it's  --it's simply a lower standard and also significantly because of the procedural differences between a preliminary injunction and an actual determination of the merits. For instance, a court can consider inadmissible evidence at a preliminary injunction.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's  -- it's true that it's only a likelihood of success, but, you know, a likelihood of success is better than an unlikelihood of success, and we have to decide who's going to pay these fees. And this -- these parties were -- they got the likelihood-of-success judgment and they got everything that they wanted in the interim before the legislature asked and -- acted, and when the legislature did act, I mean, it's  almost -- this goes back to Justice Thomas's first question -- it was almost in the nature of a unilateral settlement. It's kind of like a ""we give up,"" right?  So you have all those things. You have the likelihood-of-success finding. You have the fact that they get everything that they need and want in the interim period. And then the whole thing is brought to a close by the legislature saying essentially ""we give up"" in the same way that it would in a consent decree case, even without the final imprimatur of the court. Put all of that together, I mean, why shouldn't fees go the other way here?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> I  --I disagree with that, Justice Kagan, for a number of reasons. And, first of all, I don't think it's correct to say that if a legislature changes a law when a lawsuit is pending, that's equivalent to a legislature giving up or agreeing to a consent decree. A legislature may choose to change a statute for a number of reasons, including  because it concludes that the statute is simply poor policy, and the  --that determination should not make the government subject to an award of attorney's fees. Indeed, in awarding</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But it's not that determination that's making them subject to the attorney's fees, right?  I mean, what  --what's making them subject, I think, is the fact that before that determination, in this situation, they presented their arguments to the court as to why they believed that they were entitled to relief, and they received that relief. I mean, you -- you  --you talked about the standard of what is a prevailing party, and you originally asserted that it was a party who wins a lawsuit. But the Court has spoken in  -- I don't know how to pronounce this case -- is it Lefemine  --that a plaintiff prevails when a court order grants him actual relief on the merits of his claim that materially alters the  legal relationships between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.

So you didn't get all the relief you wanted in a lawsuit, and you're still a prevailing party. So, when I use the word ""all,"" I mean all that they wanted in this particular proceeding. This preliminary injunction, they wanted their license back, and they wanted to keep driving their cars without paying a fee to do that, and they got that pending the litigation.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Fundame ntally, it is a problem with the nature of the relief rather than the amount of the relief. And the problem is simply that there's been no actual determination on the merits, and there's been no determination --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But we  -- you started by ans wering Justice Thomas by saying default judgments and consent decrees are not determinations on the merits. So that, we have  already said, is not necessary.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Is not necessary in the context of a final judgment, Justice Sotomayor. But, as Hanrahan says, in the context of an interlocutory order, a party must have prevailed on the merits of at least one of his claims. And a preliminary injunction is not that because it requires no determination that the defendant has violated federal law.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Just briefly, is your position  -- does it encourage wasteful litigation?  In other words, if you're the -- you get your preliminary injunction, but you have a lot of attorney's fees, don't you have an incentive to go forward for a permanent injunction even though, I don't know if there would be mootness issues or standing issues, but isn't that a bad consequence of the position you're advocating?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Ultimately, Mr. Chief Justice, I think Petitioner's rule is the more judicially efficient one. Respondents' rule will create a number of perverse incentives,  including incentives on defendants to avoid mootness by freezing challenged rules in place. And while it's true that Petitioner's rule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid mootness, if a defendant concludes that further factual or legal development is unlikely to lead to a change in the preliminary injunction analysis, the defendant's going to have a very strong incentive to settle after the preliminary injunction so it doesn't continue to accrue the fees.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> If there is very strong evidence that the government changed the law primarily to avoid the payment of fees, could a court, as a matter of equity, award fees?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> You know, under a bad faith theory, I think, if it was a change, a  legislative change, again, that's -- that's not the defendant, and it usually hasn't been attributed to the defendant. If you're talking about, say, a city changing an ordinance when the city is the defendant and the court concludes it's done in bad faith, then perhaps that equitable exception, aside from the statutory exception, could apply.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Okay. One other question. As I understand it, your position is that a prevailing party must obtain a conclusive ruling on the merit or -- merits or a final judgment in its favor. What is the difference between those two categories?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> In most cases, there won't be a difference between those two categories, but a difference can arise particularly in complex remedial disputes. And Bradley, which is discussed -- and Hanrahan is a good example of this  -- Bradley was a school desegregation case, and at the time the court awarded interim fees, there had been a determination that the defendant had violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and a permanent  injunction had been entered, but the court had actually retained jurisdiction for further proceedings to see if modifications could be necessary after it saw how the permanent  injunction operated in practice.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor, anything further?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Barrett?</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Just one question about your answer to Justice Alito. What would be the basis for that equitable jurisdiction?  I mean, I understood your position to be formalist and kind of focusing on the language of the statute, and the two definitions that you just offered kind of go to that formal definition of conclusiveness and that there might be reasons why we treat a consent decree as the equivalent. But where does this equitable authority come to it?  It seems like it pretty significantly undercuts your argument.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> It -- it would not be a fee award under Section 1988 at that point, Justice Barrett, but, as discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, prior to the enactment of the fee-shifting statutes, there were common law -- very limited common law grounds for fee shifting recognized, one of which was a party acting in bad faith.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I read your brief as asking for categorical preclusion. In other words, you're saying PIs can never as opposed to sometimes. Is that right?</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> That is correct, Justice Jackson.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even though -- has any court ever held that?  I thought all the courts said maybe, sometimes.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> The Fourth Circuit rule prior to this case was a bright-line rule.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> But then they changed it.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> For those of us who think about legislative history, what  --what do you do with the fact that in Hanrahan, we  --we said that the legislative history demonstrates  that a plaintiff may sometimes prevail without having obtained a favorable final judgment?  And  we were looking at the House report that seemed to say that.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> We agree under our rule that a final judgment is not always going to be necessary under the statute, but there has to be a determination of liability on the merits on at least one claim. And that may not  be a final judgment, for instance, in a case where liability proceedings have been bifurcated from remedial proceedings.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Right, but I think, in this report, they weren't comparing final judgments to these other scenarios. They were saying you could do it as an interim matter. So the House seemed to contemplate that you could have interlocutory prevailing party status.</text><speaker>Erika L. Maley</speaker><text> Well, Hanrahan notes that the  -- the legislative history discusses interim fees with regards to two cases, one of which was Bradley, which I discussed, and the other of which was Mills, which involved this Court  holding that partial summary judgment on liability should have been granted in the plaintiffs' favor. So I don't think that the  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> You don't think it  counts, okay. Thanks.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you. Mr. Yang.

2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," What does it mean to be injured, someone to be injured, in his business?","<speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Thank you, and may it please the Court:  RICO states that any person injured in his business or property by reason of racketeering can sue therefor and recover threefold the damages he sustains.

The text differentiates the injury from racketeering and the damages sustained from that injury, thus showing that injury and damages are distinct. And the references to damages he sustains shows that damages are the losses suffere d as a result of the injury. Damages are not themselves the injury inflicted by the defendant. This distinction tracks this Court's recognition that lost wages and medical expenses are classic damages from personal injuries.

That's a personal injury claim outside civil RICO. Respondent argues that every economic loss is its own RICO injury but not to worry because RICO still bars non-pecuniary damages. But that view conflates injury and damages by treating RICO's exclusion of personal injuries as just excluding a narrow type of damages: pain and suffering and emotional distress. Respondent's rule also leaves the personal exclusion toothless since virtually all personal injuries result in monetary loss.

Personal injuries are serious and may support state tort -- tort claims, but they are not the stuff of RICO. I welcome questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> What does it mean to be injured, someone to be injured, in his business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> The Court  in -- in the Clayton Act case of Reiter talked about what -- injury to business, and it was referring to anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss, it would be both a right  -- a -- a injury to both business and property, a right to carry on business. Now the lower courts pre-RICO under the Clayton Act have also recognized that an employee has a business kind of a right to carry on in his employment, and we haven't contested that. So, in those cases, if you conspired to prevent  -- in those cases, they involved encyclopedic salesmen, deprived those people of their right to carry on their profession as a salesman, the -- the lower courts recognized that that was an injury to business. So it's a right to carry on, you know, a profession or your commercial enterprise.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Can loss of employment ever constitute a injury in business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, it's -- it certainly does in the Clayton Act. And the example I could think of, the only example that r eadily comes to mind, in RICO would be the human trafficking cases, where a person is forced to work against their will, and the -- there's an injury in your right to get, you know, the -- the payment for your performed work. So that would be an injury, a direct injury, to one's business. And that human trafficking  --it's hard to see how it would otherwis e come up unless you defrauded someone into quitting their job, but, generally, lost wages are pretty standard, prototypical damages from personal injury.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you're raising an example that leads me to think that what you're really arguing about is proximate cause, meaning -- and not really whether personal injury is recoverable or not. It is under, by your own admission, certain circumstances. And, in your brief, you list a bunch of examples that seem to me quintessential personal injuries, but you related them to the business loss and then said those were recoverable.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So personal --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So it doesn't make any sense to me to say a mob can threaten a store owner to take over his business and, if he doesn't, injure him and he can't recover, but if they put a bomb in the place and close it down, they close it down by hitting him or shooting him but then throw a bomb, he can recover for the bomb but not for the injury to himself.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So no one in  -- under this statute can ever recover for personal injuries, full stop, never ever. If there's an independent infringement  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But why?  Isn't --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of the right to property  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- isn't that an issue or shouldn't it be an issue of proximate cause, which wasn't reached in this case, correct?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, no, and here's why, because a lot of examples, the plaintiff will meet a direct and proximate cause, and I can start to give you a million, but they would  still be damages resulting from personal injury. Take your  -- a shooting where someone is shot and suffers medical expenses and can't work. Direct injury, sure, the lost wages and  medical expenses, but, still, it's damages resulting from personal injury, so a proximate cause --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But, no, there's a whole lot more to RICO than simply damages. There's also the predicate that you have to have a racketeering --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For sure.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- enterprise. You have to have willful intent. In product liability cases, most of those are negligence or strict liability, so you're not going to have willfulness or intent. And, similarly, you have to show proximate causation, reasonably foreseeable. There's a serious question as to whether you shoot someone not related to the enterprise and you cause damage, but another predicate act occurs that you're going to recover. --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, in your normal case of any personal injury, you read a -- misread --a label's confuse -- misleading, you're injured, you are  -- can't work, you have lost -- lost --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You're still not</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> That's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- you're still not answering my --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I guess what  -- so two things. You can always have causation, but there's still an independent requirement that you must be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> There has to be proximate causation  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes. And there's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- which is very different.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --plenty of proximate, direct, absolute causation, no ands, ifs, or buts, but it's still just a personal injury action that's outside the scope of RICO.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> You started by talking to Justice Thomas about what it means to be injured in your business or property. Now there  might be a set of questions there that this Court has not addressed, lower courts have, but  you said lower courts have said that to -- to lose a job is to be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. Sorry. To lose a job can be both damages or an injury. It depends on the na ture of the cause of action. So you always generally, with every personal injury, can have permanent job loss. You can have lost wages. Those are damages.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's also --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It is a very rare case  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's also a loss when  --you know, it's a -- it's a harm when I lose a job. You know, I've been harmed. I lost my job. And --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> When you pay medical expenses, you're harmed as well.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> If you're harmed when you lose a job, then you've been injured in your business, haven't you?  I mean, just as -- I -- I guess what I'm saying is the simplest, clearest reading of this statutory language is it doesn't -- it doesn't distinguish by what causes the harm. It  just says, if you're harmed in a way that's in your business or property, which has been understood to include being harmed by loss of a  job, and that's by reason of a violation of Section 1962, then you're entitled to threefold the damages you would otherwise be  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the problem with that is it's reading the statute just like the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Antiterrorism Act, to say any person injured in his person can recover threefold the damages. And the --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's not reading the statute the same way as injured in his person because, if  -- if all I come in and say is, you know, I suffered emotional distress or I suffered pain and suffering, I would not be entitled to damage  -- to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So that's an infinitesimal, small number of cases that would be excluded.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> It might be an infinitesimal, small number of cases. I'm just trying to figure out -- like, that's the most normal, natural reading of the statutory language. If you've been -- it doesn't say what  you've been injured by. I mean, you have to be injured by the RICO violation. But it doesn't  distinguish among different kinds of RICO violations. It just says, if you've been injured by a RICO violation in your business --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> In your business, right.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- which includes your employment, then you're entitled to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the only way to give the statute its normal meaning of ""damages sustained"" is to distinguish between the injury. If the Respondent had hit a tree because he was impaired from THC, that would be a classic personal injury action for lost wages and medical expenses. It sounds like you think maybe the Second Circuit is right. The Second Circuit seemed to think lost wages are always recoverable, but medical expenses never would be because that results from a physical injury. And, of course, property loss, the most fundamental of all property loss is monetary loss.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But I  --I think what  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> All personal injury actions result in monetary loss except, I guess, a case where there's just exclusively psychological damage. But every slip and fall  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, I -- I don't know exactly how your rule works because, if you don't read it that normal, straightforward way, then, you know, you  -- you get into all these -- you admit in a whole set of hypos that I can do something to you that we would normally classify as a personal injury and you would be entitled to RICO damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So, if I hit you and, as a resul t of that -- this is your car wash operator example -- there's an assault that's usually understood as a personal injury, but, as a result, you decide to do business with the mobster rather than with a legitimate businessman and you say, well, notwithstanding that it was all caused by an assault, which was a personal injury, you are entitled to RICO damages. And I think you could say the same thing here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's just not our argument.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, you could have  --you could have a proximate -- well, I don't know how you get to the answers of your hypotheticals if that's not your argument.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. Whenever you have a robbery where money is taken or an extortion where money is taken or kidnapping where ransom is taken, there are two independent infringements of your legal right. You have a right to not be hit or assaulted or whatever, you know, kidnapped, and you have a right not to have your money taken. And when money is taken, you get your money back under RICO because that's a monetary independent loss. You cannot recover for physical --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, money is taken as a result of the assault. The assault happens, and then you say:  Okay, I better do business with you. So, I mean, you're  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's why our test  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's a -- it's a consequential injury from the assault.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me give you an example. If you take the money and then shove the person down the stairs, you took the money. You may have shoved the person down the stairs to prevent them from getting their money back, but our test doesn't ask which --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But that's not your own hypos. Your own hypos are things like there's an assault, there's a kidnapping, there's a murder. All of those things are personal injuries that don't have any particular economic component. As a result of those things, you lose some business opportunities, and -- and you yourself say you get RICO under that  -- you get RICO damages under those hypotheticals. So this one  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You can --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- looks pretty much like that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. You can always get RICO damages for independent property violations. And, here, there is just an allege  of a right not to have -- not to be induced to consume THC. Our position is no different than the Clayton Act. It's the exact same rule. This Court, in the Truett versus Chrysler Motor Company case, said:  No damages resulting from personal injuries. That is our test.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. Blatt, can I  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you where you get your definition of ""legal injury""?  I mean, are you looking at just kind of general tort principles?  I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out exactly how you look at it and define it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Two -- two -- two places. So, when it says, you know, this RJR Nabisco and also just the statute, you can sue and you can  sue for a personal injury, that, to me, conjures up the infringement of a right. And in WesternGeco, when the Court talked about an infringement of the patent right, it called it ""the injury.""  In Yegiazaryan, when it talked about what the injury in that case was when trying to decide if there's a domestic injury, it talked about what the racketeering activity directly did to the plaintiff. And so injury as an infringement of a legal right is a -- I think we cite Ballentine, but that is a standard definition of ""injury.""</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Where does the ""legal"" in the ""legal right"" come from?  Are you looking kind of at general principles?  You're just looking at the nature of the harm?  Does it help you in terms of property or --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, I think it's just a question of federal law. I mean, so whether you have an injury to person, property, or business, that's a question of federal law that's informed by general tort principles.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So are you looking at, like, the Restatement?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You could in the Burke case that dealt with whether something was a  personal injury on  -- sorry, damages on account of personal injury. The Court looked at things like a Dobbs and Restatements, but it was a federal question on whether the damages resulted from the personal injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Why  --why aren't you looking  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and whether there was a per  -- whether  --whether discrimination under Title VII was, in fact, a personal injury or some other kind of injury. The Court looked at a bunch of state law sources, but it was a federal law question.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, I  -- I'm trying to understand the personal injury that you say was alleged or happened in this case. I did not perceive Mr. Horn to be relying on any sort of personal injury allegation with respect to the RICO count. He doesn't say, for example, that he took the THC and that he got ill from it and, as a result of that, he took off from work and then he got fired. He says, instead, just directly, that he  --let me see --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I think  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- alleges a pattern of mail and wire fraud related to your client's alleged fraud about whether the product took -- contained THC. He relied on that, and he got fired as a result. I don't see where personal injury is doing any work in his RICO claim.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think you're correct in the complaint that the allegations we're talking about, where he's talking about physical harm, it's talking about either the -- the allegations that are general. But page 21 of our brief goes into great detail of all the other places in his affidavit and in the RICO case statement  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah, but those are in other counts. Those are in the personal injury counts. And I think that matters, right?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, not in the RICO statement. The RICO statement, by definition, is the RICO claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm saying is the question presented in this case, that you've presented, is whether economic harms resulting from personal injuries are  injuries to business and property. So I'm trying to understand the allegation of personal injury here from which  the business harm results.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah, and I guess --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He doesn't say:  My injury is resulting from a personal injury. He says:  I'm injured because I got fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, his entire causation -- and, again, I'm not just quoting from the complaint. His affidavit  -- he needs to rely on the consumption or he doesn't have causation. Consumption is personal injury. But this was litigated at the cert stage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But does your test need to rely on the consumption?  I mean, suppose there was  --suppose the employer's rule.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think that's fair, you're right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So  -- but -- but that's why I'm sort of, with Justice Kagan, trying to understand your rule. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think our rule is, if there's no personal injury, we don't need to be here and have this discussion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm asking you -- let me ask you in a hypothetical.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> All right?  So suppose we have the same basic situation, but the employer's rule is that you can't possess --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- THC. Can't have it. And he looks at all of the advertising materials. He understands that your product does not have it based on your advertising materials, and so he buys it and he has it in his locker. I think this is an example  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that the Respondents came up with.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- because the -- the  --the employer says:  You have it. You're not supposed to have it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Does he have a RICO claim or not under those circumstances?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he doesn't have a RICO claim, but it wouldn't be covered by this case because there's no personal injury. It would be no different if he was  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. You're inserting personal injury. What I'm suggesting --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Your example doesn't involve a personal injury. Now, at most -- if I can just answer the direct question. If I was that person's lawyer, I would say:  You were injured in your business or property for the purchase price. You paid  --purchase price is a classic RICO injury, classic Clayton Act. He's entitled to three times his purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So you're saying he would have a RICO claim in --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He would  -- okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But lost wages aren't -- he doesn't rely on the law  -- he --and he would fail any kind of causation test if he tried to say:  I was f ired from the purchase price. He would ultimately fail causation under three of your Supreme Court cases that say there has to be a direct relationship between the conduc t that was done to the plaintiff and the lost claim. And there, you had the independent actor of the employer. It would be no different if the employer fired him for bei ng tricked into buying baby powder that, you know, didn't have the requisite -- it might -- he might have an injury, but he just wouldn't have a RICO claim because there would be lack of causation.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and isn't that essentially what's wrong with this case too, is what Justice Sotomayor was suggesting?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It does --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, there is a definite causation problem in this case.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> His -- his -- you know, he buys this thing. He ingests this  thing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And someone else fired him.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> A different person fires him. This is not a good RICO claim for that reason, but it has nothing to do with the reason that you're  giving.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, no, no, no, no. You can win for more than one reason, Justice Kagan. The Second Circuit held that a --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you're relying on an intuition that your client should win and Ms. Anand should lose. And that intuition may be a very valid one and  -- but the -- but the intuition works because there's no  proximate cause.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But all -- with all --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> The intuition does not work because he hasn't satisfied the business or property requirement because he has. He's been injured in his person or property --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, and with all due respect  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- by reason of a RICO violation.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- with all due respect, every classic slip-and-fall personal injury case, you could talk about causation clearly,  but it would still be the lost wages, you're fired because you either can't work because you're permanently disabled, or your employer fires you because you can no longer see or have an arm.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, maybe there's  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You still lose your job, but it's  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- maybe there's also an issue  --I mean, we haven't -- we haven't decided what this ""business or property"" phrase means. Maybe ""business or property""  doesn't mean lost wages. But, again, it -- that's a -- that's a second reason why you might win but also a reason that has nothing to do with the reason that you're articulating here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Just  -- Justice Kagan, the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit hold, if  you have a personal injury, and what the other side reads the statute to say anybody injured in his person, have at it under RICO; just don't assert economic damages. That flips the statute on its head. It doesn't say anything about being injured in your person. And, under their rule, all personal injuries are recoverable under RICO, which is an absurd not just intuitive proposition, but that cannot be within the contemplation --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Can I pick up --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of Congress.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- on Justice Barrett's question?  Because I think the other side says that injury, just ordinary meaning, means harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And you say that's wrong based on an idea that ""injury"" is a term of art, I think --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- in tort law. Can you elaborate on why injury does not equal harm?  Because that's --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- front and center in their brief.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- so I think injury could mean harm just as it means the -- the legal harm that was invaded. So I don't have a problem with the word ""harm.""  But what it doesn't mean  is loss in terms of any damage. And they have no meaning or independent distinction between ""injury"" and ""damages sustained.""  And I think inherent in that distinction between the injury that -- the injury that you sue over is the type of infringement. And you have to have  -- look, everyone agrees at least I think since you've said it twice under Clayton Act and RICO that the cause of action excludes personal injuries. So what does that mean?  We think it means what it says. It excludes personal injuries. So that means the damages from personal injuries. They say no, no, no, it includes personal injuries and it includes all damages from personal injuries.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why is this a damage from personal injury?  That's the part I don't understand. He's not claiming that he got  ill because of the product. He's not saying he was personally injured. He didn't even know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that he had ingested THC until the testing and the firing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Isn't that where his injury comes in?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think -- I mean, this was the  --this was what  the other side briefed to the Second Circuit and the Second Circuit didn't decide it. But, if I ate poppyseed bagels and failed a drug test, it's a personal injury. If I took a medicine like doxycycline, which is an antibiotic, and I can't be out in the sun and I lose my job as a lifeguard, it's a personal injury claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why are you saying that?  You can -- I mean, you're just saying that. I'm asking you, you know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Why am I saying it?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- there are -- there are personal injury claims that derive  from a person being harmed by -- by the ingestion of the product, right?  They're bodily, physically harmed because they have taken this thing. I don't read this claim to be that kind of injury. He's not saying that the  product itself injured him in any way.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think it is inconsistent with all of tort law to say a bodily invasion is not a personal injury just because you didn't have to go to the hospital or cough.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He voluntarily took the product.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, we all do.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He was not invaded. He  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> We all take products that can be mislabeled. We take them and we either get sick or we don't. But we all take products and we claim, yeah, but the label told me I wasn't going to have a side effect  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and I had the side effect.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- Ms. Blatt, if I might ask you a different question. You rely  heavily on the Clayton Act and -- and the similar language there. I went and looked at the Areeda -Hovenkamp, what they have to say about this.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, dear.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I know. I know. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah. ""Oh, dear"" is right. They say:  Reiter thus made plain that the business-or-property requirement is virtually always satisfied provided there's some kind  of injury that can properly be characterized as economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Well, I don't -- I mean, that's not right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I would go -- no.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- you just disagree with Areeda  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, yeah. No, that's definitely wro ng.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. Okay. Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely. And  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That' s all I need to know. Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. No. Wrong, wrong, wrong. And Reiter, I think, I mean, says  anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss it's going to be a business or injury. But let's  -- look, there are Clayton Act cases after Clayton  -- any -- any conspiracy to affect drug prices that result in a personal injury would mean treble damages under Clayton Act. That would be a sea change -- a sea change in Clayton Act if you had personal injury recovery for price-fixing.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So even Homer nods, the great Areeda and Hovenkamp treatise wrong?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely, because you would -- you would -- that would be, like I said, a sea change under Clayton Act. I mean, it might be a boondoggle for plaintiffs' lawyers, but I think it would freak everyone else out.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, aren't you estopped from claiming that he has a personal injury here when below you argued or  your client argued that he had no personal injury, which is why all the personal injury claims were dismissed?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I don't understand how you can have it both ways.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. On page 113 of the Pet. App., the district court is recognizing that we argued, and the court said, there's no cognizable injury. But, on pages 49 and 50, which I think is pretty bad for the other side, the court is saying but there's clearly a -- this is a classic personal injury claim, which is why he can get lost wages for fraud.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. I'm talking about what you argued. Your client argued, to get rid of the personal injury claims, that he had no personal injury; the only thing was economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So -- so --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And so now that he's left with the economic, you say no, there is a personal injury and he can't get damages for that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Sorry. On pages 49 and 50, it goes through how we, the defendants, are arguing th is is a personal injury claim. So we did argue it was a personal injury claim. We  claimed what we're talking about before, there's no cognizable personal injury. It's like saying  emotional damage, it's not -- it doesn't count because you didn't have  --it didn't manifest itself in physical. So I don't think we're estopped. If you want to let that, I guess, I don't know, reverse, you'd have to reverse the rule and then decide if we're estopped, but I don't -- I'm not sure how that would work out if that's what you thought.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Do you want to respond to their invocation of the liberal construction canon?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes, a couple responses. I mean, liberal construction in light of its remedial purposes, but the one thing all nine of you should agree on, its remedial purposes did not extend to personal injuries. You've already said that twice, in the Clayton Act and in RJR Nabisco. It doesn't extend to remediate personal injury. Second of all, I think it's a tie-breaker. Their  -- their serious reading of the statute inserts the word ""injured in its person"" to read just like the Antiterrorism Act. And, finally, I think it does run up against the constitutional principle of federalism, that their view does cannibalize all of state tort law. Every -- every slip and fall from a mislabel now is a RICO case. So I think, I mean, that should be  -- the Court -- I mean, one more thing I'll try on that, the Court last cited that clause in 1985. I mean, it hasn't relied on it since and says you shouldn't use it to put RICO in contexts that Congress, you know, didn't want or couldn't have contemplated. And, here, it is just so  -- would be so striking to think that RICO remedied personal injuries.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say that under RICO, injury is ""the invasion of a legal right.""  So how would we go about determining  whether something is a legal right for this purpose?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, first, you look at the complaint. I think property's pretty easy because the Court has already said any monetary  loss is a property loss. So, I mean, you could quibble about whether loss of consortium, if state law defines that as a property loss. And then injury is also, I think, pretty easy  because that involves the body.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, what authorities would we look at?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh. Look at the complaint. Look at state law general tort principles. Again, that Burke case  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> General tort principles?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. What Burke said is -- which I like because it -- I think it works -- is that are the damages -- what are the damages seeking to redress?  Are the damages redressing a  --something that happened to the body, are they redressing stolen property, or  are they redressing a right to carry on in your business?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you rely a lot on WesternGeco. You mentioned it a  few minutes ago.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you ignore its language where they differentiate a patent case where the legal right is the right not to be infringed and where you feel the economic loss is different. And we said there that the Patent Act was different from civil RICO because the question in civil RICO is where the plaintiff feels the injury, in other words, where he suffers the economic harm that the damages compensate. So why should we think -- in -- in Sedima, we were very, very clear that RICO doesn't rely on state law -- state tort law concepts. We said that explicitly. What we  said was that RICO complicates injuries to have been caused by predicate acts. That's our --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and we explicitly -- explicitly say:  Not otherwise an  injury cognizable under state tort law.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's even better for me because our position is you shouldn't -- you can't get recovery that's -- that's caused by personal injury, which I think this case is. But, on RJR Nabisco -- sorry, the WesternGeco citing RJR Nabisco, I didn't --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that goes back to what Justice Jackson and  -- and what I tried earlier and Justice Kagan point out:  You're trying to say there's a difference between the two. But we've made very clear in WesternGeco there isn't. Injury is where you feel the harm. Now the question is:  What's the harm?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yegiazaryan said the opposite. Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as Justice Jackson said, the harm is not ingesting the drugs. That's the personal injury. The harm is from being fired. And whether there's a connection between the predicate acts and that harm  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- is a question of proximate cause, not a question of personal injury.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan is the most recent case where you said the injury was -- the inability to collect the California judgment was a domestic injury. You did not say it was the injury where all the effects were felt, which were a million different places  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that has nothing to do with the language of RICO -- of RICO, which says --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It was the language of</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- compensable injuries are the harms caused by predicate acts. And that's what we said in WesternGeco.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It's where you feel the harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan quotes that exact same language, and I think it's talk -- it begs the question about what is the harm talking about. Is it the harm that's the legal invasion of the right, or is it the damages at the end of the day?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask you about a hypo?  Because I'm still trying to understand your rule. You seem to be suggesting that the mere existence of physical harm renders any business injury not compensable. Is that  -- is that the  --do I have the sum total of your --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No?  Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because you just said --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So what is your rule?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --you just -- because you just said it's any personal injury renders the -- 40 damages  not recoverable. Obviously, if you have a business injury, a property injury, you can recover damages.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even if you have a physical injury too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely, because that's the example of a robbery. If you are thrown down a flight of stairs and they take your wallet, you have two injuries. You fell down the stairs and you lost your wallet.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You've got -- so you have a property injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- and a personal injury</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --two independent invasions.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and so, here, you say he took the drugs and that was an injury. And he says:  I was also fired. Why isn't that  two injuries too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because every  -- you would -- because -- because that conflates damages. Every personal injury, you could say I slip and fell --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But this is -- imagine that this is not damages in the following sense, all right?  If we have a case  in which he takes the drugs --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and, as a result of taking the drugs, he has to go to  the hospital, and, as a result of being in the hospital, he can't work.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I kind of understand the argument you're making. But, in this situation, he takes the drugs and there is no harm --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to him from taking the drugs.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me leave you with one more example. He goes to the hospital and he loses his sight and he can't drive anymore, so he gets fired. He still has a loss of employment. It is a damage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. But that's not this case. Nothing happened to him as a result of taking the drugs. Instead, what happened to him, I think -- and this is -- maybe I'm just not understanding.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he failed a drug test. It changed his -- well, allegedly, it had THC in it. I think it's the same thing as if you took something and had an allergic reaction. It's a physical, chemical, bodily invasion. He didn't want  -- he didn't want THC and he took it. It's like taking cocaine. That's a  -- to me, that's a physical injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- whether or not you hid something.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anand.</text>",coherent
2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas, Can loss of employment ever constitute a injury in business?,"<speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Thank you, and may it please the Court:  RICO states that any person injured in his business or property by reason of racketeering can sue therefor and recover threefold the damages he sustains. Because RICO's cause of action excludes personal injuries, RICO excludes damages resulting from personal injuries. The text differentiates the injury from racketeering and the damages sustained from that injury, thus showing that injury and damages are distinct. And the references to damages he sustains shows that damages are the losses suffere d as a result of the injury. Damages are not themselves the injury inflicted by the defendant. This distinction tracks this Court's recognition that lost wages and medical expenses are classic damages from personal injuries. Respondent's complaint alleges  the personal injury of unwanted ingestion of THC and the resulting damages of lost wages. To quote the complaint:  ""Defendant's behavior caused  Plaintiff's fiscal harm in the ingestion of Dixie, and as a direct result of consuming this  product, he was dismissed from his employment."" That's a personal injury claim outside civil RICO. Respondent argues that every economic loss is its own RICO injury but not to worry because RICO still bars non-pecuniary damages. But that view conflates injury and damages by treating RICO's exclusion of personal injuries as just excluding a narrow type of damages: pain and suffering and emotional distress. Respondent's rule also leaves the personal exclusion toothless since virtually all personal injuries result in monetary loss. It is utterly implausible that Congress federalized every slip and fall involving RICO predicates. Personal injuries are serious and may support state tort -- tort claims, but they are not the stuff of RICO. I welcome questions.</text>","<speaker>John G.

I welcome questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> What does it mean to be injured, someone to be injured, in his business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> The Court  in -- in the Clayton Act case of Reiter talked about what -- injury to business, and it was referring to anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss, it would be both a right  -- a -- a injury to both business and property, a right to carry on business. Now the lower courts pre-RICO under the Clayton Act have also recognized that an employee has a business kind of a right to carry on in his employment, and we haven't contested that. So, in those cases, if you conspired to prevent  -- in those cases, they involved encyclopedic salesmen, deprived those people of their right to carry on their profession as a salesman, the -- the lower courts recognized that that was an injury to business. So it's a right to carry on, you know, a profession or your commercial enterprise.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Can loss of employment ever constitute a injury in business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, it's -- it certainly does in the Clayton Act. And the example I could think of, the only example that r eadily comes to mind, in RICO would be the human trafficking cases, where a person is forced to work against their will, and the -- there's an injury in your right to get, you know, the -- the payment for your performed work. So that would be an injury, a direct injury, to one's business. And that human trafficking  --it's hard to see how it would otherwis e come up unless you defrauded someone into quitting their job, but, generally, lost wages are pretty standard, prototypical damages from personal injury.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you're raising an example that leads me to think that what you're really arguing about is proximate cause, meaning -- and not really whether personal injury is recoverable or not. It is under, by your own admission, certain circumstances. And, in your brief, you list a bunch of examples that seem to me quintessential personal injuries, but you related them to the business loss and then said those were recoverable.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So personal --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So it doesn't make any sense to me to say a mob can threaten a store owner to take over his business and, if he doesn't, injure him and he can't recover, but if they put a bomb in the place and close it down, they close it down by hitting him or shooting him but then throw a bomb, he can recover for the bomb but not for the injury to himself.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So no one in  -- under this statute can ever recover for personal injuries, full stop, never ever. If there's an independent infringement  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But why?  Isn't --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of the right to property  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- isn't that an issue or shouldn't it be an issue of proximate cause, which wasn't reached in this case, correct?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, no, and here's why, because a lot of examples, the plaintiff will meet a direct and proximate cause, and I can start to give you a million, but they would  still be damages resulting from personal injury. Take your  -- a shooting where someone is shot and suffers medical expenses and can't work. Direct injury, sure, the lost wages and  medical expenses, but, still, it's damages resulting from personal injury, so a proximate cause --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But, no, there's a whole lot more to RICO than simply damages. There's also the predicate that you have to have a racketeering --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For sure.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- enterprise. You have to have willful intent. In product liability cases, most of those are negligence or strict liability, so you're not going to have willfulness or intent. And, similarly, you have to show proximate causation, reasonably foreseeable. There's a serious question as to whether you shoot someone not related to the enterprise and you cause damage, but another predicate act occurs that you're going to recover. --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, in your normal case of any personal injury, you read a -- misread --a label's confuse -- misleading, you're injured, you are  -- can't work, you have lost -- lost --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You're still not</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> That's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- you're still not answering my --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I guess what  -- so two things. You can always have causation, but there's still an independent requirement that you must be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> There has to be proximate causation  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes. And there's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- which is very different.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --plenty of proximate, direct, absolute causation, no ands, ifs, or buts, but it's still just a personal injury action that's outside the scope of RICO.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> You started by talking to Justice Thomas about what it means to be injured in your business or property. Now there  might be a set of questions there that this Court has not addressed, lower courts have, but  you said lower courts have said that to -- to lose a job is to be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. Sorry. To lose a job can be both damages or an injury. It depends on the na ture of the cause of action. So you always generally, with every personal injury, can have permanent job loss. You can have lost wages. Those are damages.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's also --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It is a very rare case  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's also a loss when  --you know, it's a -- it's a harm when I lose a job. You know, I've been harmed. I lost my job. And --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> When you pay medical expenses, you're harmed as well.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> If you're harmed when you lose a job, then you've been injured in your business, haven't you?  I mean, just as -- I -- I guess what I'm saying is the simplest, clearest reading of this statutory language is it doesn't -- it doesn't distinguish by what causes the harm. It  just says, if you're harmed in a way that's in your business or property, which has been understood to include being harmed by loss of a  job, and that's by reason of a violation of Section 1962, then you're entitled to threefold the damages you would otherwise be  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the problem with that is it's reading the statute just like the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Antiterrorism Act, to say any person injured in his person can recover threefold the damages. And the --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's not reading the statute the same way as injured in his person because, if  -- if all I come in and say is, you know, I suffered emotional distress or I suffered pain and suffering, I would not be entitled to damage  -- to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So that's an infinitesimal, small number of cases that would be excluded.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> It might be an infinitesimal, small number of cases. I'm just trying to figure out -- like, that's the most normal, natural reading of the statutory language. If you've been -- it doesn't say what  you've been injured by. I mean, you have to be injured by the RICO violation. But it doesn't  distinguish among different kinds of RICO violations. It just says, if you've been injured by a RICO violation in your business --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> In your business, right.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- which includes your employment, then you're entitled to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the only way to give the statute its normal meaning of ""damages sustained"" is to distinguish between the injury. If the Respondent had hit a tree because he was impaired from THC, that would be a classic personal injury action for lost wages and medical expenses. It sounds like you think maybe the Second Circuit is right. The Second Circuit seemed to think lost wages are always recoverable, but medical expenses never would be because that results from a physical injury. And, of course, property loss, the most fundamental of all property loss is monetary loss.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But I  --I think what  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> All personal injury actions result in monetary loss except, I guess, a case where there's just exclusively psychological damage. But every slip and fall  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, I -- I don't know exactly how your rule works because, if you don't read it that normal, straightforward way, then, you know, you  -- you get into all these -- you admit in a whole set of hypos that I can do something to you that we would normally classify as a personal injury and you would be entitled to RICO damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So, if I hit you and, as a resul t of that -- this is your car wash operator example -- there's an assault that's usually understood as a personal injury, but, as a result, you decide to do business with the mobster rather than with a legitimate businessman and you say, well, notwithstanding that it was all caused by an assault, which was a personal injury, you are entitled to RICO damages. And I think you could say the same thing here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's just not our argument.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, you could have  --you could have a proximate -- well, I don't know how you get to the answers of your hypotheticals if that's not your argument.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. Whenever you have a robbery where money is taken or an extortion where money is taken or kidnapping where ransom is taken, there are two independent infringements of your legal right. You have a right to not be hit or assaulted or whatever, you know, kidnapped, and you have a right not to have your money taken. And when money is taken, you get your money back under RICO because that's a monetary independent loss. You cannot recover for physical --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, money is taken as a result of the assault. The assault happens, and then you say:  Okay, I better do business with you. So, I mean, you're  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's why our test  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's a -- it's a consequential injury from the assault.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me give you an example. If you take the money and then shove the person down the stairs, you took the money. You may have shoved the person down the stairs to prevent them from getting their money back, but our test doesn't ask which --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But that's not your own hypos. Your own hypos are things like there's an assault, there's a kidnapping, there's a murder. All of those things are personal injuries that don't have any particular economic component. As a result of those things, you lose some business opportunities, and -- and you yourself say you get RICO under that  -- you get RICO damages under those hypotheticals. So this one  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You can --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- looks pretty much like that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. You can always get RICO damages for independent property violations. And, here, there is just an allege  of a right not to have -- not to be induced to consume THC. Our position is no different than the Clayton Act. It's the exact same rule. This Court, in the Truett versus Chrysler Motor Company case, said:  No damages resulting from personal injuries. That is our test.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. Blatt, can I  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you where you get your definition of ""legal injury""?  I mean, are you looking at just kind of general tort principles?  I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out exactly how you look at it and define it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Two -- two -- two places. So, when it says, you know, this RJR Nabisco and also just the statute, you can sue and you can  sue for a personal injury, that, to me, conjures up the infringement of a right. And in WesternGeco, when the Court talked about an infringement of the patent right, it called it ""the injury.""  In Yegiazaryan, when it talked about what the injury in that case was when trying to decide if there's a domestic injury, it talked about what the racketeering activity directly did to the plaintiff. And so injury as an infringement of a legal right is a -- I think we cite Ballentine, but that is a standard definition of ""injury.""</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Where does the ""legal"" in the ""legal right"" come from?  Are you looking kind of at general principles?  You're just looking at the nature of the harm?  Does it help you in terms of property or --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, I think it's just a question of federal law. I mean, so whether you have an injury to person, property, or business, that's a question of federal law that's informed by general tort principles.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So are you looking at, like, the Restatement?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You could in the Burke case that dealt with whether something was a  personal injury on  -- sorry, damages on account of personal injury. The Court looked at things like a Dobbs and Restatements, but it was a federal question on whether the damages resulted from the personal injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Why  --why aren't you looking  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and whether there was a per  -- whether  --whether discrimination under Title VII was, in fact, a personal injury or some other kind of injury. The Court looked at a bunch of state law sources, but it was a federal law question.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, I  -- I'm trying to understand the personal injury that you say was alleged or happened in this case. I did not perceive Mr. Horn to be relying on any sort of personal injury allegation with respect to the RICO count. He doesn't say, for example, that he took the THC and that he got ill from it and, as a result of that, he took off from work and then he got fired. He says, instead, just directly, that he  --let me see --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I think  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- alleges a pattern of mail and wire fraud related to your client's alleged fraud about whether the product took -- contained THC. He relied on that, and he got fired as a result. I don't see where personal injury is doing any work in his RICO claim.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think you're correct in the complaint that the allegations we're talking about, where he's talking about physical harm, it's talking about either the -- the allegations that are general. But page 21 of our brief goes into great detail of all the other places in his affidavit and in the RICO case statement  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah, but those are in other counts. Those are in the personal injury counts. And I think that matters, right?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, not in the RICO statement. The RICO statement, by definition, is the RICO claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm saying is the question presented in this case, that you've presented, is whether economic harms resulting from personal injuries are  injuries to business and property. So I'm trying to understand the allegation of personal injury here from which  the business harm results.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah, and I guess --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He doesn't say:  My injury is resulting from a personal injury. He says:  I'm injured because I got fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, his entire causation -- and, again, I'm not just quoting from the complaint. His affidavit  -- he needs to rely on the consumption or he doesn't have causation. Consumption is personal injury. But this was litigated at the cert stage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But does your test need to rely on the consumption?  I mean, suppose there was  --suppose the employer's rule.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think that's fair, you're right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So  -- but -- but that's why I'm sort of, with Justice Kagan, trying to understand your rule. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think our rule is, if there's no personal injury, we don't need to be here and have this discussion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm asking you -- let me ask you in a hypothetical.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> All right?  So suppose we have the same basic situation, but the employer's rule is that you can't possess --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- THC. Can't have it. And he looks at all of the advertising materials. He understands that your product does not have it based on your advertising materials, and so he buys it and he has it in his locker. I think this is an example  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that the Respondents came up with.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- because the -- the  --the employer says:  You have it. You're not supposed to have it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Does he have a RICO claim or not under those circumstances?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he doesn't have a RICO claim, but it wouldn't be covered by this case because there's no personal injury. It would be no different if he was  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. You're inserting personal injury. What I'm suggesting --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Your example doesn't involve a personal injury. Now, at most -- if I can just answer the direct question. If I was that person's lawyer, I would say:  You were injured in your business or property for the purchase price. You paid  --purchase price is a classic RICO injury, classic Clayton Act. He's entitled to three times his purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So you're saying he would have a RICO claim in --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He would  -- okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But lost wages aren't -- he doesn't rely on the law  -- he --and he would fail any kind of causation test if he tried to say:  I was f ired from the purchase price. He would ultimately fail causation under three of your Supreme Court cases that say there has to be a direct relationship between the conduc t that was done to the plaintiff and the lost claim. And there, you had the independent actor of the employer. It would be no different if the employer fired him for bei ng tricked into buying baby powder that, you know, didn't have the requisite -- it might -- he might have an injury, but he just wouldn't have a RICO claim because there would be lack of causation.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and isn't that essentially what's wrong with this case too, is what Justice Sotomayor was suggesting?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It does --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, there is a definite causation problem in this case.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> His -- his -- you know, he buys this thing. He ingests this  thing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And someone else fired him.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> A different person fires him. This is not a good RICO claim for that reason, but it has nothing to do with the reason that you're  giving.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, no, no, no, no. You can win for more than one reason, Justice Kagan. The Second Circuit held that a --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you're relying on an intuition that your client should win and Ms. Anand should lose. And that intuition may be a very valid one and  -- but the -- but the intuition works because there's no  proximate cause.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But all -- with all --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> The intuition does not work because he hasn't satisfied the business or property requirement because he has. He's been injured in his person or property --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, and with all due respect  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- by reason of a RICO violation.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- with all due respect, every classic slip-and-fall personal injury case, you could talk about causation clearly,  but it would still be the lost wages, you're fired because you either can't work because you're permanently disabled, or your employer fires you because you can no longer see or have an arm.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, maybe there's  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You still lose your job, but it's  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- maybe there's also an issue  --I mean, we haven't -- we haven't decided what this ""business or property"" phrase means. Maybe ""business or property""  doesn't mean lost wages. But, again, it -- that's a -- that's a second reason why you might win but also a reason that has nothing to do with the reason that you're articulating here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Just  -- Justice Kagan, the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit hold, if  you have a personal injury, and what the other side reads the statute to say anybody injured in his person, have at it under RICO; just don't assert economic damages. That flips the statute on its head. It doesn't say anything about being injured in your person. And, under their rule, all personal injuries are recoverable under RICO, which is an absurd not just intuitive proposition, but that cannot be within the contemplation --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Can I pick up --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of Congress.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- on Justice Barrett's question?  Because I think the other side says that injury, just ordinary meaning, means harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And you say that's wrong based on an idea that ""injury"" is a term of art, I think --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- in tort law. Can you elaborate on why injury does not equal harm?  Because that's --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- front and center in their brief.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- so I think injury could mean harm just as it means the -- the legal harm that was invaded. So I don't have a problem with the word ""harm.""  But what it doesn't mean  is loss in terms of any damage. And they have no meaning or independent distinction between ""injury"" and ""damages sustained.""  And I think inherent in that distinction between the injury that -- the injury that you sue over is the type of infringement. And you have to have  -- look, everyone agrees at least I think since you've said it twice under Clayton Act and RICO that the cause of action excludes personal injuries. So what does that mean?  We think it means what it says. It excludes personal injuries. So that means the damages from personal injuries. They say no, no, no, it includes personal injuries and it includes all damages from personal injuries.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why is this a damage from personal injury?  That's the part I don't understand. He's not claiming that he got  ill because of the product. He's not saying he was personally injured. He didn't even know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that he had ingested THC until the testing and the firing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Isn't that where his injury comes in?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think -- I mean, this was the  --this was what  the other side briefed to the Second Circuit and the Second Circuit didn't decide it. But, if I ate poppyseed bagels and failed a drug test, it's a personal injury. If I took a medicine like doxycycline, which is an antibiotic, and I can't be out in the sun and I lose my job as a lifeguard, it's a personal injury claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why are you saying that?  You can -- I mean, you're just saying that. I'm asking you, you know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Why am I saying it?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- there are -- there are personal injury claims that derive  from a person being harmed by -- by the ingestion of the product, right?  They're bodily, physically harmed because they have taken this thing. I don't read this claim to be that kind of injury. He's not saying that the  product itself injured him in any way.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think it is inconsistent with all of tort law to say a bodily invasion is not a personal injury just because you didn't have to go to the hospital or cough.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He voluntarily took the product.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, we all do.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He was not invaded. He  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> We all take products that can be mislabeled. We take them and we either get sick or we don't. But we all take products and we claim, yeah, but the label told me I wasn't going to have a side effect  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and I had the side effect.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- Ms. Blatt, if I might ask you a different question. You rely  heavily on the Clayton Act and -- and the similar language there. I went and looked at the Areeda -Hovenkamp, what they have to say about this.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, dear.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I know. I know. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah. ""Oh, dear"" is right. They say:  Reiter thus made plain that the business-or-property requirement is virtually always satisfied provided there's some kind  of injury that can properly be characterized as economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Well, I don't -- I mean, that's not right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I would go -- no.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- you just disagree with Areeda  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, yeah. No, that's definitely wro ng.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. Okay. Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely. And  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That' s all I need to know. Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. No. Wrong, wrong, wrong. And Reiter, I think, I mean, says  anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss it's going to be a business or injury. But let's  -- look, there are Clayton Act cases after Clayton  -- any -- any conspiracy to affect drug prices that result in a personal injury would mean treble damages under Clayton Act. That would be a sea change -- a sea change in Clayton Act if you had personal injury recovery for price-fixing.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So even Homer nods, the great Areeda and Hovenkamp treatise wrong?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely, because you would -- you would -- that would be, like I said, a sea change under Clayton Act. I mean, it might be a boondoggle for plaintiffs' lawyers, but I think it would freak everyone else out.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, aren't you estopped from claiming that he has a personal injury here when below you argued or  your client argued that he had no personal injury, which is why all the personal injury claims were dismissed?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I don't understand how you can have it both ways.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. On page 113 of the Pet. App., the district court is recognizing that we argued, and the court said, there's no cognizable injury. But, on pages 49 and 50, which I think is pretty bad for the other side, the court is saying but there's clearly a -- this is a classic personal injury claim, which is why he can get lost wages for fraud.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. I'm talking about what you argued. Your client argued, to get rid of the personal injury claims, that he had no personal injury; the only thing was economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So -- so --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And so now that he's left with the economic, you say no, there is a personal injury and he can't get damages for that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Sorry. On pages 49 and 50, it goes through how we, the defendants, are arguing th is is a personal injury claim. So we did argue it was a personal injury claim. We  claimed what we're talking about before, there's no cognizable personal injury. It's like saying  emotional damage, it's not -- it doesn't count because you didn't have  --it didn't manifest itself in physical. So I don't think we're estopped. If you want to let that, I guess, I don't know, reverse, you'd have to reverse the rule and then decide if we're estopped, but I don't -- I'm not sure how that would work out if that's what you thought.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Do you want to respond to their invocation of the liberal construction canon?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes, a couple responses. I mean, liberal construction in light of its remedial purposes, but the one thing all nine of you should agree on, its remedial purposes did not extend to personal injuries. You've already said that twice, in the Clayton Act and in RJR Nabisco. It doesn't extend to remediate personal injury. Second of all, I think it's a tie-breaker. Their  -- their serious reading of the statute inserts the word ""injured in its person"" to read just like the Antiterrorism Act. And, finally, I think it does run up against the constitutional principle of federalism, that their view does cannibalize all of state tort law. Every -- every slip and fall from a mislabel now is a RICO case. So I think, I mean, that should be  -- the Court -- I mean, one more thing I'll try on that, the Court last cited that clause in 1985. I mean, it hasn't relied on it since and says you shouldn't use it to put RICO in contexts that Congress, you know, didn't want or couldn't have contemplated. And, here, it is just so  -- would be so striking to think that RICO remedied personal injuries.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say that under RICO, injury is ""the invasion of a legal right.""  So how would we go about determining  whether something is a legal right for this purpose?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, first, you look at the complaint. I think property's pretty easy because the Court has already said any monetary  loss is a property loss. So, I mean, you could quibble about whether loss of consortium, if state law defines that as a property loss. And then injury is also, I think, pretty easy  because that involves the body.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, what authorities would we look at?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh. Look at the complaint. Look at state law general tort principles. Again, that Burke case  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> General tort principles?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. What Burke said is -- which I like because it -- I think it works -- is that are the damages -- what are the damages seeking to redress?  Are the damages redressing a  --something that happened to the body, are they redressing stolen property, or  are they redressing a right to carry on in your business?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you rely a lot on WesternGeco. You mentioned it a  few minutes ago.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you ignore its language where they differentiate a patent case where the legal right is the right not to be infringed and where you feel the economic loss is different. And we said there that the Patent Act was different from civil RICO because the question in civil RICO is where the plaintiff feels the injury, in other words, where he suffers the economic harm that the damages compensate. So why should we think -- in -- in Sedima, we were very, very clear that RICO doesn't rely on state law -- state tort law concepts. We said that explicitly. What we  said was that RICO complicates injuries to have been caused by predicate acts. That's our --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and we explicitly -- explicitly say:  Not otherwise an  injury cognizable under state tort law.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's even better for me because our position is you shouldn't -- you can't get recovery that's -- that's caused by personal injury, which I think this case is. But, on RJR Nabisco -- sorry, the WesternGeco citing RJR Nabisco, I didn't --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that goes back to what Justice Jackson and  -- and what I tried earlier and Justice Kagan point out:  You're trying to say there's a difference between the two. But we've made very clear in WesternGeco there isn't. Injury is where you feel the harm. Now the question is:  What's the harm?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yegiazaryan said the opposite. Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as Justice Jackson said, the harm is not ingesting the drugs. That's the personal injury. The harm is from being fired. And whether there's a connection between the predicate acts and that harm  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- is a question of proximate cause, not a question of personal injury.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan is the most recent case where you said the injury was -- the inability to collect the California judgment was a domestic injury. You did not say it was the injury where all the effects were felt, which were a million different places  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that has nothing to do with the language of RICO -- of RICO, which says --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It was the language of</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- compensable injuries are the harms caused by predicate acts. And that's what we said in WesternGeco.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It's where you feel the harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan quotes that exact same language, and I think it's talk -- it begs the question about what is the harm talking about. Is it the harm that's the legal invasion of the right, or is it the damages at the end of the day?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask you about a hypo?  Because I'm still trying to understand your rule. You seem to be suggesting that the mere existence of physical harm renders any business injury not compensable. Is that  -- is that the  --do I have the sum total of your --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No?  Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because you just said --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So what is your rule?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --you just -- because you just said it's any personal injury renders the -- 40 damages  not recoverable. Obviously, if you have a business injury, a property injury, you can recover damages.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even if you have a physical injury too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely, because that's the example of a robbery. If you are thrown down a flight of stairs and they take your wallet, you have two injuries. You fell down the stairs and you lost your wallet.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You've got -- so you have a property injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- and a personal injury</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --two independent invasions.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and so, here, you say he took the drugs and that was an injury. And he says:  I was also fired. Why isn't that  two injuries too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because every  -- you would -- because -- because that conflates damages. Every personal injury, you could say I slip and fell --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But this is -- imagine that this is not damages in the following sense, all right?  If we have a case  in which he takes the drugs --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and, as a result of taking the drugs, he has to go to  the hospital, and, as a result of being in the hospital, he can't work.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I kind of understand the argument you're making. But, in this situation, he takes the drugs and there is no harm --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to him from taking the drugs.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me leave you with one more example. He goes to the hospital and he loses his sight and he can't drive anymore, so he gets fired. He still has a loss of employment. It is a damage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. But that's not this case. Nothing happened to him as a result of taking the drugs. Instead, what happened to him, I think -- and this is -- maybe I'm just not understanding.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he failed a drug test. It changed his -- well, allegedly, it had THC in it. I think it's the same thing as if you took something and had an allergic reaction. It's a physical, chemical, bodily invasion. He didn't want  -- he didn't want THC and he took it. It's like taking cocaine. That's a  -- to me, that's a physical injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- whether or not you hid something.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anand.</text>",coherent
2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan," If you're harmed when you lose a job, then you've been injured in your business, haven't you?

Personal injuries are serious and may support state tort -- tort claims, but they are not the stuff of RICO. I welcome questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> What does it mean to be injured, someone to be injured, in his business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> The Court  in -- in the Clayton Act case of Reiter talked about what -- injury to business, and it was referring to anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss, it would be both a right  -- a -- a injury to both business and property, a right to carry on business. Now the lower courts pre-RICO under the Clayton Act have also recognized that an employee has a business kind of a right to carry on in his employment, and we haven't contested that. So, in those cases, if you conspired to prevent  -- in those cases, they involved encyclopedic salesmen, deprived those people of their right to carry on their profession as a salesman, the -- the lower courts recognized that that was an injury to business. So it's a right to carry on, you know, a profession or your commercial enterprise.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Can loss of employment ever constitute a injury in business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, it's -- it certainly does in the Clayton Act. And the example I could think of, the only example that r eadily comes to mind, in RICO would be the human trafficking cases, where a person is forced to work against their will, and the -- there's an injury in your right to get, you know, the -- the payment for your performed work. So that would be an injury, a direct injury, to one's business. And that human trafficking  --it's hard to see how it would otherwis e come up unless you defrauded someone into quitting their job, but, generally, lost wages are pretty standard, prototypical damages from personal injury.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you're raising an example that leads me to think that what you're really arguing about is proximate cause, meaning -- and not really whether personal injury is recoverable or not. It is under, by your own admission, certain circumstances. And, in your brief, you list a bunch of examples that seem to me quintessential personal injuries, but you related them to the business loss and then said those were recoverable.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So personal --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So it doesn't make any sense to me to say a mob can threaten a store owner to take over his business and, if he doesn't, injure him and he can't recover, but if they put a bomb in the place and close it down, they close it down by hitting him or shooting him but then throw a bomb, he can recover for the bomb but not for the injury to himself.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So no one in  -- under this statute can ever recover for personal injuries, full stop, never ever. If there's an independent infringement  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But why?  Isn't --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of the right to property  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- isn't that an issue or shouldn't it be an issue of proximate cause, which wasn't reached in this case, correct?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, no, and here's why, because a lot of examples, the plaintiff will meet a direct and proximate cause, and I can start to give you a million, but they would  still be damages resulting from personal injury. Take your  -- a shooting where someone is shot and suffers medical expenses and can't work. Direct injury, sure, the lost wages and  medical expenses, but, still, it's damages resulting from personal injury, so a proximate cause --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But, no, there's a whole lot more to RICO than simply damages. There's also the predicate that you have to have a racketeering --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For sure.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- enterprise. You have to have willful intent. In product liability cases, most of those are negligence or strict liability, so you're not going to have willfulness or intent. And, similarly, you have to show proximate causation, reasonably foreseeable. There's a serious question as to whether you shoot someone not related to the enterprise and you cause damage, but another predicate act occurs that you're going to recover. --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, in your normal case of any personal injury, you read a -- misread --a label's confuse -- misleading, you're injured, you are  -- can't work, you have lost -- lost --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You're still not</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> That's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- you're still not answering my --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I guess what  -- so two things. You can always have causation, but there's still an independent requirement that you must be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> There has to be proximate causation  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes. And there's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- which is very different.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --plenty of proximate, direct, absolute causation, no ands, ifs, or buts, but it's still just a personal injury action that's outside the scope of RICO.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> You started by talking to Justice Thomas about what it means to be injured in your business or property. Now there  might be a set of questions there that this Court has not addressed, lower courts have, but  you said lower courts have said that to -- to lose a job is to be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. Sorry. To lose a job can be both damages or an injury. It depends on the na ture of the cause of action. So you always generally, with every personal injury, can have permanent job loss. You can have lost wages. Those are damages.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's also --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It is a very rare case  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's also a loss when  --you know, it's a -- it's a harm when I lose a job. You know, I've been harmed. I lost my job. And --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> When you pay medical expenses, you're harmed as well.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> If you're harmed when you lose a job, then you've been injured in your business, haven't you?  I mean, just as -- I -- I guess what I'm saying is the simplest, clearest reading of this statutory language is it doesn't -- it doesn't distinguish by what causes the harm. It  just says, if you're harmed in a way that's in your business or property, which has been understood to include being harmed by loss of a  job, and that's by reason of a violation of Section 1962, then you're entitled to threefold the damages you would otherwise be  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the problem with that is it's reading the statute just like the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Antiterrorism Act, to say any person injured in his person can recover threefold the damages. And the --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's not reading the statute the same way as injured in his person because, if  -- if all I come in and say is, you know, I suffered emotional distress or I suffered pain and suffering, I would not be entitled to damage  -- to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So that's an infinitesimal, small number of cases that would be excluded.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> It might be an infinitesimal, small number of cases. I'm just trying to figure out -- like, that's the most normal, natural reading of the statutory language. If you've been -- it doesn't say what  you've been injured by. I mean, you have to be injured by the RICO violation. But it doesn't  distinguish among different kinds of RICO violations. It just says, if you've been injured by a RICO violation in your business --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> In your business, right.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- which includes your employment, then you're entitled to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the only way to give the statute its normal meaning of ""damages sustained"" is to distinguish between the injury. If the Respondent had hit a tree because he was impaired from THC, that would be a classic personal injury action for lost wages and medical expenses. It sounds like you think maybe the Second Circuit is right. The Second Circuit seemed to think lost wages are always recoverable, but medical expenses never would be because that results from a physical injury. And, of course, property loss, the most fundamental of all property loss is monetary loss.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But I  --I think what  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> All personal injury actions result in monetary loss except, I guess, a case where there's just exclusively psychological damage. But every slip and fall  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, I -- I don't know exactly how your rule works because, if you don't read it that normal, straightforward way, then, you know, you  -- you get into all these -- you admit in a whole set of hypos that I can do something to you that we would normally classify as a personal injury and you would be entitled to RICO damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So, if I hit you and, as a resul t of that -- this is your car wash operator example -- there's an assault that's usually understood as a personal injury, but, as a result, you decide to do business with the mobster rather than with a legitimate businessman and you say, well, notwithstanding that it was all caused by an assault, which was a personal injury, you are entitled to RICO damages. And I think you could say the same thing here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's just not our argument.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, you could have  --you could have a proximate -- well, I don't know how you get to the answers of your hypotheticals if that's not your argument.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. Whenever you have a robbery where money is taken or an extortion where money is taken or kidnapping where ransom is taken, there are two independent infringements of your legal right. You have a right to not be hit or assaulted or whatever, you know, kidnapped, and you have a right not to have your money taken. And when money is taken, you get your money back under RICO because that's a monetary independent loss. You cannot recover for physical --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, money is taken as a result of the assault. The assault happens, and then you say:  Okay, I better do business with you. So, I mean, you're  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's why our test  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's a -- it's a consequential injury from the assault.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me give you an example. If you take the money and then shove the person down the stairs, you took the money. You may have shoved the person down the stairs to prevent them from getting their money back, but our test doesn't ask which --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But that's not your own hypos. Your own hypos are things like there's an assault, there's a kidnapping, there's a murder. All of those things are personal injuries that don't have any particular economic component. As a result of those things, you lose some business opportunities, and -- and you yourself say you get RICO under that  -- you get RICO damages under those hypotheticals. So this one  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You can --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- looks pretty much like that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. You can always get RICO damages for independent property violations. And, here, there is just an allege  of a right not to have -- not to be induced to consume THC. Our position is no different than the Clayton Act. It's the exact same rule. This Court, in the Truett versus Chrysler Motor Company case, said:  No damages resulting from personal injuries. That is our test.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. Blatt, can I  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you where you get your definition of ""legal injury""?  I mean, are you looking at just kind of general tort principles?  I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out exactly how you look at it and define it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Two -- two -- two places. So, when it says, you know, this RJR Nabisco and also just the statute, you can sue and you can  sue for a personal injury, that, to me, conjures up the infringement of a right. And in WesternGeco, when the Court talked about an infringement of the patent right, it called it ""the injury.""  In Yegiazaryan, when it talked about what the injury in that case was when trying to decide if there's a domestic injury, it talked about what the racketeering activity directly did to the plaintiff. And so injury as an infringement of a legal right is a -- I think we cite Ballentine, but that is a standard definition of ""injury.""</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Where does the ""legal"" in the ""legal right"" come from?  Are you looking kind of at general principles?  You're just looking at the nature of the harm?  Does it help you in terms of property or --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, I think it's just a question of federal law. I mean, so whether you have an injury to person, property, or business, that's a question of federal law that's informed by general tort principles.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So are you looking at, like, the Restatement?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You could in the Burke case that dealt with whether something was a  personal injury on  -- sorry, damages on account of personal injury. The Court looked at things like a Dobbs and Restatements, but it was a federal question on whether the damages resulted from the personal injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Why  --why aren't you looking  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and whether there was a per  -- whether  --whether discrimination under Title VII was, in fact, a personal injury or some other kind of injury. The Court looked at a bunch of state law sources, but it was a federal law question.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, I  -- I'm trying to understand the personal injury that you say was alleged or happened in this case. I did not perceive Mr. Horn to be relying on any sort of personal injury allegation with respect to the RICO count. He doesn't say, for example, that he took the THC and that he got ill from it and, as a result of that, he took off from work and then he got fired. He says, instead, just directly, that he  --let me see --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I think  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- alleges a pattern of mail and wire fraud related to your client's alleged fraud about whether the product took -- contained THC. He relied on that, and he got fired as a result. I don't see where personal injury is doing any work in his RICO claim.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think you're correct in the complaint that the allegations we're talking about, where he's talking about physical harm, it's talking about either the -- the allegations that are general. But page 21 of our brief goes into great detail of all the other places in his affidavit and in the RICO case statement  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah, but those are in other counts. Those are in the personal injury counts. And I think that matters, right?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, not in the RICO statement. The RICO statement, by definition, is the RICO claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm saying is the question presented in this case, that you've presented, is whether economic harms resulting from personal injuries are  injuries to business and property. So I'm trying to understand the allegation of personal injury here from which  the business harm results.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah, and I guess --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He doesn't say:  My injury is resulting from a personal injury. He says:  I'm injured because I got fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, his entire causation -- and, again, I'm not just quoting from the complaint. His affidavit  -- he needs to rely on the consumption or he doesn't have causation. Consumption is personal injury. But this was litigated at the cert stage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But does your test need to rely on the consumption?  I mean, suppose there was  --suppose the employer's rule.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think that's fair, you're right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So  -- but -- but that's why I'm sort of, with Justice Kagan, trying to understand your rule. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think our rule is, if there's no personal injury, we don't need to be here and have this discussion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm asking you -- let me ask you in a hypothetical.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> All right?  So suppose we have the same basic situation, but the employer's rule is that you can't possess --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- THC. Can't have it. And he looks at all of the advertising materials. He understands that your product does not have it based on your advertising materials, and so he buys it and he has it in his locker. I think this is an example  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that the Respondents came up with.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- because the -- the  --the employer says:  You have it. You're not supposed to have it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Does he have a RICO claim or not under those circumstances?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he doesn't have a RICO claim, but it wouldn't be covered by this case because there's no personal injury. It would be no different if he was  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. You're inserting personal injury. What I'm suggesting --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Your example doesn't involve a personal injury. Now, at most -- if I can just answer the direct question. If I was that person's lawyer, I would say:  You were injured in your business or property for the purchase price. You paid  --purchase price is a classic RICO injury, classic Clayton Act. He's entitled to three times his purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So you're saying he would have a RICO claim in --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He would  -- okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But lost wages aren't -- he doesn't rely on the law  -- he --and he would fail any kind of causation test if he tried to say:  I was f ired from the purchase price. He would ultimately fail causation under three of your Supreme Court cases that say there has to be a direct relationship between the conduc t that was done to the plaintiff and the lost claim. And there, you had the independent actor of the employer. It would be no different if the employer fired him for bei ng tricked into buying baby powder that, you know, didn't have the requisite -- it might -- he might have an injury, but he just wouldn't have a RICO claim because there would be lack of causation.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and isn't that essentially what's wrong with this case too, is what Justice Sotomayor was suggesting?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It does --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, there is a definite causation problem in this case.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> His -- his -- you know, he buys this thing. He ingests this  thing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And someone else fired him.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> A different person fires him. This is not a good RICO claim for that reason, but it has nothing to do with the reason that you're  giving.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, no, no, no, no. You can win for more than one reason, Justice Kagan. The Second Circuit held that a --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you're relying on an intuition that your client should win and Ms. Anand should lose. And that intuition may be a very valid one and  -- but the -- but the intuition works because there's no  proximate cause.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But all -- with all --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> The intuition does not work because he hasn't satisfied the business or property requirement because he has. He's been injured in his person or property --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, and with all due respect  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- by reason of a RICO violation.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- with all due respect, every classic slip-and-fall personal injury case, you could talk about causation clearly,  but it would still be the lost wages, you're fired because you either can't work because you're permanently disabled, or your employer fires you because you can no longer see or have an arm.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, maybe there's  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You still lose your job, but it's  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- maybe there's also an issue  --I mean, we haven't -- we haven't decided what this ""business or property"" phrase means. Maybe ""business or property""  doesn't mean lost wages. But, again, it -- that's a -- that's a second reason why you might win but also a reason that has nothing to do with the reason that you're articulating here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Just  -- Justice Kagan, the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit hold, if  you have a personal injury, and what the other side reads the statute to say anybody injured in his person, have at it under RICO; just don't assert economic damages. That flips the statute on its head. It doesn't say anything about being injured in your person. And, under their rule, all personal injuries are recoverable under RICO, which is an absurd not just intuitive proposition, but that cannot be within the contemplation --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Can I pick up --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of Congress.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- on Justice Barrett's question?  Because I think the other side says that injury, just ordinary meaning, means harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And you say that's wrong based on an idea that ""injury"" is a term of art, I think --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- in tort law. Can you elaborate on why injury does not equal harm?  Because that's --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- front and center in their brief.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- so I think injury could mean harm just as it means the -- the legal harm that was invaded. So I don't have a problem with the word ""harm.""  But what it doesn't mean  is loss in terms of any damage. And they have no meaning or independent distinction between ""injury"" and ""damages sustained.""  And I think inherent in that distinction between the injury that -- the injury that you sue over is the type of infringement. And you have to have  -- look, everyone agrees at least I think since you've said it twice under Clayton Act and RICO that the cause of action excludes personal injuries. So what does that mean?  We think it means what it says. It excludes personal injuries. So that means the damages from personal injuries. They say no, no, no, it includes personal injuries and it includes all damages from personal injuries.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why is this a damage from personal injury?  That's the part I don't understand. He's not claiming that he got  ill because of the product. He's not saying he was personally injured. He didn't even know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that he had ingested THC until the testing and the firing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Isn't that where his injury comes in?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think -- I mean, this was the  --this was what  the other side briefed to the Second Circuit and the Second Circuit didn't decide it. But, if I ate poppyseed bagels and failed a drug test, it's a personal injury. If I took a medicine like doxycycline, which is an antibiotic, and I can't be out in the sun and I lose my job as a lifeguard, it's a personal injury claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why are you saying that?  You can -- I mean, you're just saying that. I'm asking you, you know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Why am I saying it?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- there are -- there are personal injury claims that derive  from a person being harmed by -- by the ingestion of the product, right?  They're bodily, physically harmed because they have taken this thing. I don't read this claim to be that kind of injury. He's not saying that the  product itself injured him in any way.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think it is inconsistent with all of tort law to say a bodily invasion is not a personal injury just because you didn't have to go to the hospital or cough.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He voluntarily took the product.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, we all do.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He was not invaded. He  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> We all take products that can be mislabeled. We take them and we either get sick or we don't. But we all take products and we claim, yeah, but the label told me I wasn't going to have a side effect  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and I had the side effect.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- Ms. Blatt, if I might ask you a different question. You rely  heavily on the Clayton Act and -- and the similar language there. I went and looked at the Areeda -Hovenkamp, what they have to say about this.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, dear.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I know. I know. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah. ""Oh, dear"" is right. They say:  Reiter thus made plain that the business-or-property requirement is virtually always satisfied provided there's some kind  of injury that can properly be characterized as economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Well, I don't -- I mean, that's not right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I would go -- no.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- you just disagree with Areeda  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, yeah. No, that's definitely wro ng.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. Okay. Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely. And  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That' s all I need to know. Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. No. Wrong, wrong, wrong. And Reiter, I think, I mean, says  anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss it's going to be a business or injury. But let's  -- look, there are Clayton Act cases after Clayton  -- any -- any conspiracy to affect drug prices that result in a personal injury would mean treble damages under Clayton Act. That would be a sea change -- a sea change in Clayton Act if you had personal injury recovery for price-fixing.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So even Homer nods, the great Areeda and Hovenkamp treatise wrong?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely, because you would -- you would -- that would be, like I said, a sea change under Clayton Act. I mean, it might be a boondoggle for plaintiffs' lawyers, but I think it would freak everyone else out.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, aren't you estopped from claiming that he has a personal injury here when below you argued or  your client argued that he had no personal injury, which is why all the personal injury claims were dismissed?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I don't understand how you can have it both ways.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. On page 113 of the Pet. App., the district court is recognizing that we argued, and the court said, there's no cognizable injury. But, on pages 49 and 50, which I think is pretty bad for the other side, the court is saying but there's clearly a -- this is a classic personal injury claim, which is why he can get lost wages for fraud.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. I'm talking about what you argued. Your client argued, to get rid of the personal injury claims, that he had no personal injury; the only thing was economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So -- so --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And so now that he's left with the economic, you say no, there is a personal injury and he can't get damages for that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Sorry. On pages 49 and 50, it goes through how we, the defendants, are arguing th is is a personal injury claim. So we did argue it was a personal injury claim. We  claimed what we're talking about before, there's no cognizable personal injury. It's like saying  emotional damage, it's not -- it doesn't count because you didn't have  --it didn't manifest itself in physical. So I don't think we're estopped. If you want to let that, I guess, I don't know, reverse, you'd have to reverse the rule and then decide if we're estopped, but I don't -- I'm not sure how that would work out if that's what you thought.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Do you want to respond to their invocation of the liberal construction canon?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes, a couple responses. I mean, liberal construction in light of its remedial purposes, but the one thing all nine of you should agree on, its remedial purposes did not extend to personal injuries. You've already said that twice, in the Clayton Act and in RJR Nabisco. It doesn't extend to remediate personal injury. Second of all, I think it's a tie-breaker. Their  -- their serious reading of the statute inserts the word ""injured in its person"" to read just like the Antiterrorism Act. And, finally, I think it does run up against the constitutional principle of federalism, that their view does cannibalize all of state tort law. Every -- every slip and fall from a mislabel now is a RICO case. So I think, I mean, that should be  -- the Court -- I mean, one more thing I'll try on that, the Court last cited that clause in 1985. I mean, it hasn't relied on it since and says you shouldn't use it to put RICO in contexts that Congress, you know, didn't want or couldn't have contemplated. And, here, it is just so  -- would be so striking to think that RICO remedied personal injuries.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say that under RICO, injury is ""the invasion of a legal right.""  So how would we go about determining  whether something is a legal right for this purpose?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, first, you look at the complaint. I think property's pretty easy because the Court has already said any monetary  loss is a property loss. So, I mean, you could quibble about whether loss of consortium, if state law defines that as a property loss. And then injury is also, I think, pretty easy  because that involves the body.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, what authorities would we look at?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh. Look at the complaint. Look at state law general tort principles. Again, that Burke case  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> General tort principles?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. What Burke said is -- which I like because it -- I think it works -- is that are the damages -- what are the damages seeking to redress?  Are the damages redressing a  --something that happened to the body, are they redressing stolen property, or  are they redressing a right to carry on in your business?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you rely a lot on WesternGeco. You mentioned it a  few minutes ago.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you ignore its language where they differentiate a patent case where the legal right is the right not to be infringed and where you feel the economic loss is different. And we said there that the Patent Act was different from civil RICO because the question in civil RICO is where the plaintiff feels the injury, in other words, where he suffers the economic harm that the damages compensate. So why should we think -- in -- in Sedima, we were very, very clear that RICO doesn't rely on state law -- state tort law concepts. We said that explicitly. What we  said was that RICO complicates injuries to have been caused by predicate acts. That's our --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and we explicitly -- explicitly say:  Not otherwise an  injury cognizable under state tort law.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's even better for me because our position is you shouldn't -- you can't get recovery that's -- that's caused by personal injury, which I think this case is. But, on RJR Nabisco -- sorry, the WesternGeco citing RJR Nabisco, I didn't --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that goes back to what Justice Jackson and  -- and what I tried earlier and Justice Kagan point out:  You're trying to say there's a difference between the two. But we've made very clear in WesternGeco there isn't. Injury is where you feel the harm. Now the question is:  What's the harm?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yegiazaryan said the opposite. Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as Justice Jackson said, the harm is not ingesting the drugs. That's the personal injury. The harm is from being fired. And whether there's a connection between the predicate acts and that harm  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- is a question of proximate cause, not a question of personal injury.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan is the most recent case where you said the injury was -- the inability to collect the California judgment was a domestic injury. You did not say it was the injury where all the effects were felt, which were a million different places  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that has nothing to do with the language of RICO -- of RICO, which says --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It was the language of</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- compensable injuries are the harms caused by predicate acts. And that's what we said in WesternGeco.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It's where you feel the harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan quotes that exact same language, and I think it's talk -- it begs the question about what is the harm talking about. Is it the harm that's the legal invasion of the right, or is it the damages at the end of the day?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask you about a hypo?  Because I'm still trying to understand your rule. You seem to be suggesting that the mere existence of physical harm renders any business injury not compensable. Is that  -- is that the  --do I have the sum total of your --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No?  Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because you just said --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So what is your rule?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --you just -- because you just said it's any personal injury renders the -- 40 damages  not recoverable. Obviously, if you have a business injury, a property injury, you can recover damages.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even if you have a physical injury too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely, because that's the example of a robbery. If you are thrown down a flight of stairs and they take your wallet, you have two injuries. You fell down the stairs and you lost your wallet.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You've got -- so you have a property injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- and a personal injury</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --two independent invasions.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and so, here, you say he took the drugs and that was an injury. And he says:  I was also fired. Why isn't that  two injuries too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because every  -- you would -- because -- because that conflates damages. Every personal injury, you could say I slip and fell --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But this is -- imagine that this is not damages in the following sense, all right?  If we have a case  in which he takes the drugs --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and, as a result of taking the drugs, he has to go to  the hospital, and, as a result of being in the hospital, he can't work.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I kind of understand the argument you're making. But, in this situation, he takes the drugs and there is no harm --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to him from taking the drugs.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me leave you with one more example. He goes to the hospital and he loses his sight and he can't drive anymore, so he gets fired. He still has a loss of employment. It is a damage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. But that's not this case. Nothing happened to him as a result of taking the drugs. Instead, what happened to him, I think -- and this is -- maybe I'm just not understanding.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he failed a drug test. It changed his -- well, allegedly, it had THC in it. I think it's the same thing as if you took something and had an allergic reaction. It's a physical, chemical, bodily invasion. He didn't want  -- he didn't want THC and he took it. It's like taking cocaine. That's a  -- to me, that's a physical injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- whether or not you hid something.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anand.</text>",coherent
2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Ms. Blatt, can I ask you where you get your definition of ""legal injury""?  I mean, are you looking at just kind of general tort principles?  I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out exactly how you look at it and define it.","<speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Thank you, and may it please the Court:  RICO states that any person injured in his business or property by reason of racketeering can sue therefor and recover threefold the damages he sustains. Because RICO's cause of action excludes personal injuries, RICO excludes damages resulting from personal injuries. The text differentiates the injury from racketeering and the damages sustained from that injury, thus showing that injury and damages are distinct. And the references to damages he sustains shows that damages are the losses suffere d as a result of the injury. Damages are not themselves the injury inflicted by the defendant. This distinction tracks this Court's recognition that lost wages and medical expenses are classic damages from personal injuries. Respondent's complaint alleges  the personal injury of unwanted ingestion of THC and the resulting damages of lost wages. To quote the complaint:  ""Defendant's behavior caused  Plaintiff's fiscal harm in the ingestion of Dixie, and as a direct result of consuming this  product, he was dismissed from his employment."" That's a personal injury claim outside civil RICO. Respondent argues that every economic loss is its own RICO injury but not to worry because RICO still bars non-pecuniary damages. But that view conflates injury and damages by treating RICO's exclusion of personal injuries as just excluding a narrow type of damages: pain and suffering and emotional distress. Respondent's rule also leaves the personal exclusion toothless since virtually all personal injuries result in monetary loss. It is utterly implausible that Congress federalized every slip and fall involving RICO predicates.

I welcome questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> What does it mean to be injured, someone to be injured, in his business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> The Court  in -- in the Clayton Act case of Reiter talked about what -- injury to business, and it was referring to anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss, it would be both a right  -- a -- a injury to both business and property, a right to carry on business. Now the lower courts pre-RICO under the Clayton Act have also recognized that an employee has a business kind of a right to carry on in his employment, and we haven't contested that. So, in those cases, if you conspired to prevent  -- in those cases, they involved encyclopedic salesmen, deprived those people of their right to carry on their profession as a salesman, the -- the lower courts recognized that that was an injury to business. So it's a right to carry on, you know, a profession or your commercial enterprise.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Can loss of employment ever constitute a injury in business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, it's -- it certainly does in the Clayton Act. And the example I could think of, the only example that r eadily comes to mind, in RICO would be the human trafficking cases, where a person is forced to work against their will, and the -- there's an injury in your right to get, you know, the -- the payment for your performed work. So that would be an injury, a direct injury, to one's business. And that human trafficking  --it's hard to see how it would otherwis e come up unless you defrauded someone into quitting their job, but, generally, lost wages are pretty standard, prototypical damages from personal injury.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you're raising an example that leads me to think that what you're really arguing about is proximate cause, meaning -- and not really whether personal injury is recoverable or not. It is under, by your own admission, certain circumstances. And, in your brief, you list a bunch of examples that seem to me quintessential personal injuries, but you related them to the business loss and then said those were recoverable.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So personal --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So it doesn't make any sense to me to say a mob can threaten a store owner to take over his business and, if he doesn't, injure him and he can't recover, but if they put a bomb in the place and close it down, they close it down by hitting him or shooting him but then throw a bomb, he can recover for the bomb but not for the injury to himself.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So no one in  -- under this statute can ever recover for personal injuries, full stop, never ever. If there's an independent infringement  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But why?  Isn't --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of the right to property  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- isn't that an issue or shouldn't it be an issue of proximate cause, which wasn't reached in this case, correct?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, no, and here's why, because a lot of examples, the plaintiff will meet a direct and proximate cause, and I can start to give you a million, but they would  still be damages resulting from personal injury. Take your  -- a shooting where someone is shot and suffers medical expenses and can't work. Direct injury, sure, the lost wages and  medical expenses, but, still, it's damages resulting from personal injury, so a proximate cause --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But, no, there's a whole lot more to RICO than simply damages. There's also the predicate that you have to have a racketeering --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For sure.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- enterprise. You have to have willful intent. In product liability cases, most of those are negligence or strict liability, so you're not going to have willfulness or intent. And, similarly, you have to show proximate causation, reasonably foreseeable. There's a serious question as to whether you shoot someone not related to the enterprise and you cause damage, but another predicate act occurs that you're going to recover. --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, in your normal case of any personal injury, you read a -- misread --a label's confuse -- misleading, you're injured, you are  -- can't work, you have lost -- lost --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You're still not</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> That's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- you're still not answering my --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I guess what  -- so two things. You can always have causation, but there's still an independent requirement that you must be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> There has to be proximate causation  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes. And there's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- which is very different.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --plenty of proximate, direct, absolute causation, no ands, ifs, or buts, but it's still just a personal injury action that's outside the scope of RICO.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> You started by talking to Justice Thomas about what it means to be injured in your business or property. Now there  might be a set of questions there that this Court has not addressed, lower courts have, but  you said lower courts have said that to -- to lose a job is to be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. Sorry. To lose a job can be both damages or an injury. It depends on the na ture of the cause of action. So you always generally, with every personal injury, can have permanent job loss. You can have lost wages. Those are damages.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's also --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It is a very rare case  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's also a loss when  --you know, it's a -- it's a harm when I lose a job. You know, I've been harmed. I lost my job. And --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> When you pay medical expenses, you're harmed as well.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> If you're harmed when you lose a job, then you've been injured in your business, haven't you?  I mean, just as -- I -- I guess what I'm saying is the simplest, clearest reading of this statutory language is it doesn't -- it doesn't distinguish by what causes the harm. It  just says, if you're harmed in a way that's in your business or property, which has been understood to include being harmed by loss of a  job, and that's by reason of a violation of Section 1962, then you're entitled to threefold the damages you would otherwise be  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the problem with that is it's reading the statute just like the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Antiterrorism Act, to say any person injured in his person can recover threefold the damages. And the --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's not reading the statute the same way as injured in his person because, if  -- if all I come in and say is, you know, I suffered emotional distress or I suffered pain and suffering, I would not be entitled to damage  -- to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So that's an infinitesimal, small number of cases that would be excluded.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> It might be an infinitesimal, small number of cases. I'm just trying to figure out -- like, that's the most normal, natural reading of the statutory language. If you've been -- it doesn't say what  you've been injured by. I mean, you have to be injured by the RICO violation. But it doesn't  distinguish among different kinds of RICO violations. It just says, if you've been injured by a RICO violation in your business --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> In your business, right.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- which includes your employment, then you're entitled to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the only way to give the statute its normal meaning of ""damages sustained"" is to distinguish between the injury. If the Respondent had hit a tree because he was impaired from THC, that would be a classic personal injury action for lost wages and medical expenses. It sounds like you think maybe the Second Circuit is right. The Second Circuit seemed to think lost wages are always recoverable, but medical expenses never would be because that results from a physical injury. And, of course, property loss, the most fundamental of all property loss is monetary loss.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But I  --I think what  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> All personal injury actions result in monetary loss except, I guess, a case where there's just exclusively psychological damage. But every slip and fall  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, I -- I don't know exactly how your rule works because, if you don't read it that normal, straightforward way, then, you know, you  -- you get into all these -- you admit in a whole set of hypos that I can do something to you that we would normally classify as a personal injury and you would be entitled to RICO damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So, if I hit you and, as a resul t of that -- this is your car wash operator example -- there's an assault that's usually understood as a personal injury, but, as a result, you decide to do business with the mobster rather than with a legitimate businessman and you say, well, notwithstanding that it was all caused by an assault, which was a personal injury, you are entitled to RICO damages. And I think you could say the same thing here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's just not our argument.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, you could have  --you could have a proximate -- well, I don't know how you get to the answers of your hypotheticals if that's not your argument.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. Whenever you have a robbery where money is taken or an extortion where money is taken or kidnapping where ransom is taken, there are two independent infringements of your legal right. You have a right to not be hit or assaulted or whatever, you know, kidnapped, and you have a right not to have your money taken. And when money is taken, you get your money back under RICO because that's a monetary independent loss. You cannot recover for physical --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, money is taken as a result of the assault. The assault happens, and then you say:  Okay, I better do business with you. So, I mean, you're  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's why our test  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's a -- it's a consequential injury from the assault.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me give you an example. If you take the money and then shove the person down the stairs, you took the money. You may have shoved the person down the stairs to prevent them from getting their money back, but our test doesn't ask which --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But that's not your own hypos. Your own hypos are things like there's an assault, there's a kidnapping, there's a murder. All of those things are personal injuries that don't have any particular economic component. As a result of those things, you lose some business opportunities, and -- and you yourself say you get RICO under that  -- you get RICO damages under those hypotheticals. So this one  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You can --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- looks pretty much like that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. You can always get RICO damages for independent property violations. And, here, there is just an allege  of a right not to have -- not to be induced to consume THC. Our position is no different than the Clayton Act. It's the exact same rule. This Court, in the Truett versus Chrysler Motor Company case, said:  No damages resulting from personal injuries. That is our test.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. Blatt, can I  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you where you get your definition of ""legal injury""?  I mean, are you looking at just kind of general tort principles?  I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out exactly how you look at it and define it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Two -- two -- two places. So, when it says, you know, this RJR Nabisco and also just the statute, you can sue and you can  sue for a personal injury, that, to me, conjures up the infringement of a right. And in WesternGeco, when the Court talked about an infringement of the patent right, it called it ""the injury.""  In Yegiazaryan, when it talked about what the injury in that case was when trying to decide if there's a domestic injury, it talked about what the racketeering activity directly did to the plaintiff. And so injury as an infringement of a legal right is a -- I think we cite Ballentine, but that is a standard definition of ""injury.""</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Where does the ""legal"" in the ""legal right"" come from?  Are you looking kind of at general principles?  You're just looking at the nature of the harm?  Does it help you in terms of property or --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, I think it's just a question of federal law. I mean, so whether you have an injury to person, property, or business, that's a question of federal law that's informed by general tort principles.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So are you looking at, like, the Restatement?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You could in the Burke case that dealt with whether something was a  personal injury on  -- sorry, damages on account of personal injury. The Court looked at things like a Dobbs and Restatements, but it was a federal question on whether the damages resulted from the personal injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Why  --why aren't you looking  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and whether there was a per  -- whether  --whether discrimination under Title VII was, in fact, a personal injury or some other kind of injury. The Court looked at a bunch of state law sources, but it was a federal law question.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, I  -- I'm trying to understand the personal injury that you say was alleged or happened in this case. I did not perceive Mr. Horn to be relying on any sort of personal injury allegation with respect to the RICO count. He doesn't say, for example, that he took the THC and that he got ill from it and, as a result of that, he took off from work and then he got fired. He says, instead, just directly, that he  --let me see --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I think  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- alleges a pattern of mail and wire fraud related to your client's alleged fraud about whether the product took -- contained THC. He relied on that, and he got fired as a result. I don't see where personal injury is doing any work in his RICO claim.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think you're correct in the complaint that the allegations we're talking about, where he's talking about physical harm, it's talking about either the -- the allegations that are general. But page 21 of our brief goes into great detail of all the other places in his affidavit and in the RICO case statement  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah, but those are in other counts. Those are in the personal injury counts. And I think that matters, right?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, not in the RICO statement. The RICO statement, by definition, is the RICO claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm saying is the question presented in this case, that you've presented, is whether economic harms resulting from personal injuries are  injuries to business and property. So I'm trying to understand the allegation of personal injury here from which  the business harm results.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah, and I guess --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He doesn't say:  My injury is resulting from a personal injury. He says:  I'm injured because I got fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, his entire causation -- and, again, I'm not just quoting from the complaint. His affidavit  -- he needs to rely on the consumption or he doesn't have causation. Consumption is personal injury. But this was litigated at the cert stage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But does your test need to rely on the consumption?  I mean, suppose there was  --suppose the employer's rule.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think that's fair, you're right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So  -- but -- but that's why I'm sort of, with Justice Kagan, trying to understand your rule. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think our rule is, if there's no personal injury, we don't need to be here and have this discussion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm asking you -- let me ask you in a hypothetical.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> All right?  So suppose we have the same basic situation, but the employer's rule is that you can't possess --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- THC. Can't have it. And he looks at all of the advertising materials. He understands that your product does not have it based on your advertising materials, and so he buys it and he has it in his locker. I think this is an example  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that the Respondents came up with.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- because the -- the  --the employer says:  You have it. You're not supposed to have it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Does he have a RICO claim or not under those circumstances?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he doesn't have a RICO claim, but it wouldn't be covered by this case because there's no personal injury. It would be no different if he was  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. You're inserting personal injury. What I'm suggesting --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Your example doesn't involve a personal injury. Now, at most -- if I can just answer the direct question. If I was that person's lawyer, I would say:  You were injured in your business or property for the purchase price. You paid  --purchase price is a classic RICO injury, classic Clayton Act. He's entitled to three times his purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So you're saying he would have a RICO claim in --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He would  -- okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But lost wages aren't -- he doesn't rely on the law  -- he --and he would fail any kind of causation test if he tried to say:  I was f ired from the purchase price. He would ultimately fail causation under three of your Supreme Court cases that say there has to be a direct relationship between the conduc t that was done to the plaintiff and the lost claim. And there, you had the independent actor of the employer. It would be no different if the employer fired him for bei ng tricked into buying baby powder that, you know, didn't have the requisite -- it might -- he might have an injury, but he just wouldn't have a RICO claim because there would be lack of causation.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and isn't that essentially what's wrong with this case too, is what Justice Sotomayor was suggesting?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It does --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, there is a definite causation problem in this case.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> His -- his -- you know, he buys this thing. He ingests this  thing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And someone else fired him.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> A different person fires him. This is not a good RICO claim for that reason, but it has nothing to do with the reason that you're  giving.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, no, no, no, no. You can win for more than one reason, Justice Kagan. The Second Circuit held that a --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you're relying on an intuition that your client should win and Ms. Anand should lose. And that intuition may be a very valid one and  -- but the -- but the intuition works because there's no  proximate cause.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But all -- with all --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> The intuition does not work because he hasn't satisfied the business or property requirement because he has. He's been injured in his person or property --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, and with all due respect  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- by reason of a RICO violation.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- with all due respect, every classic slip-and-fall personal injury case, you could talk about causation clearly,  but it would still be the lost wages, you're fired because you either can't work because you're permanently disabled, or your employer fires you because you can no longer see or have an arm.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, maybe there's  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You still lose your job, but it's  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- maybe there's also an issue  --I mean, we haven't -- we haven't decided what this ""business or property"" phrase means. Maybe ""business or property""  doesn't mean lost wages. But, again, it -- that's a -- that's a second reason why you might win but also a reason that has nothing to do with the reason that you're articulating here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Just  -- Justice Kagan, the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit hold, if  you have a personal injury, and what the other side reads the statute to say anybody injured in his person, have at it under RICO; just don't assert economic damages. That flips the statute on its head. It doesn't say anything about being injured in your person. And, under their rule, all personal injuries are recoverable under RICO, which is an absurd not just intuitive proposition, but that cannot be within the contemplation --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Can I pick up --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of Congress.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- on Justice Barrett's question?  Because I think the other side says that injury, just ordinary meaning, means harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And you say that's wrong based on an idea that ""injury"" is a term of art, I think --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- in tort law. Can you elaborate on why injury does not equal harm?  Because that's --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- front and center in their brief.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- so I think injury could mean harm just as it means the -- the legal harm that was invaded. So I don't have a problem with the word ""harm.""  But what it doesn't mean  is loss in terms of any damage. And they have no meaning or independent distinction between ""injury"" and ""damages sustained.""  And I think inherent in that distinction between the injury that -- the injury that you sue over is the type of infringement. And you have to have  -- look, everyone agrees at least I think since you've said it twice under Clayton Act and RICO that the cause of action excludes personal injuries. So what does that mean?  We think it means what it says. It excludes personal injuries. So that means the damages from personal injuries. They say no, no, no, it includes personal injuries and it includes all damages from personal injuries.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why is this a damage from personal injury?  That's the part I don't understand. He's not claiming that he got  ill because of the product. He's not saying he was personally injured. He didn't even know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that he had ingested THC until the testing and the firing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Isn't that where his injury comes in?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think -- I mean, this was the  --this was what  the other side briefed to the Second Circuit and the Second Circuit didn't decide it. But, if I ate poppyseed bagels and failed a drug test, it's a personal injury. If I took a medicine like doxycycline, which is an antibiotic, and I can't be out in the sun and I lose my job as a lifeguard, it's a personal injury claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why are you saying that?  You can -- I mean, you're just saying that. I'm asking you, you know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Why am I saying it?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- there are -- there are personal injury claims that derive  from a person being harmed by -- by the ingestion of the product, right?  They're bodily, physically harmed because they have taken this thing. I don't read this claim to be that kind of injury. He's not saying that the  product itself injured him in any way.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think it is inconsistent with all of tort law to say a bodily invasion is not a personal injury just because you didn't have to go to the hospital or cough.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He voluntarily took the product.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, we all do.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He was not invaded. He  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> We all take products that can be mislabeled. We take them and we either get sick or we don't. But we all take products and we claim, yeah, but the label told me I wasn't going to have a side effect  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and I had the side effect.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- Ms. Blatt, if I might ask you a different question. You rely  heavily on the Clayton Act and -- and the similar language there. I went and looked at the Areeda -Hovenkamp, what they have to say about this.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, dear.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I know. I know. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah. ""Oh, dear"" is right. They say:  Reiter thus made plain that the business-or-property requirement is virtually always satisfied provided there's some kind  of injury that can properly be characterized as economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Well, I don't -- I mean, that's not right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I would go -- no.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- you just disagree with Areeda  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, yeah. No, that's definitely wro ng.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. Okay. Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely. And  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That' s all I need to know. Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. No. Wrong, wrong, wrong. And Reiter, I think, I mean, says  anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss it's going to be a business or injury. But let's  -- look, there are Clayton Act cases after Clayton  -- any -- any conspiracy to affect drug prices that result in a personal injury would mean treble damages under Clayton Act. That would be a sea change -- a sea change in Clayton Act if you had personal injury recovery for price-fixing.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So even Homer nods, the great Areeda and Hovenkamp treatise wrong?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely, because you would -- you would -- that would be, like I said, a sea change under Clayton Act. I mean, it might be a boondoggle for plaintiffs' lawyers, but I think it would freak everyone else out.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, aren't you estopped from claiming that he has a personal injury here when below you argued or  your client argued that he had no personal injury, which is why all the personal injury claims were dismissed?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I don't understand how you can have it both ways.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. On page 113 of the Pet. App., the district court is recognizing that we argued, and the court said, there's no cognizable injury. But, on pages 49 and 50, which I think is pretty bad for the other side, the court is saying but there's clearly a -- this is a classic personal injury claim, which is why he can get lost wages for fraud.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. I'm talking about what you argued. Your client argued, to get rid of the personal injury claims, that he had no personal injury; the only thing was economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So -- so --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And so now that he's left with the economic, you say no, there is a personal injury and he can't get damages for that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Sorry. On pages 49 and 50, it goes through how we, the defendants, are arguing th is is a personal injury claim. So we did argue it was a personal injury claim. We  claimed what we're talking about before, there's no cognizable personal injury. It's like saying  emotional damage, it's not -- it doesn't count because you didn't have  --it didn't manifest itself in physical. So I don't think we're estopped. If you want to let that, I guess, I don't know, reverse, you'd have to reverse the rule and then decide if we're estopped, but I don't -- I'm not sure how that would work out if that's what you thought.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Do you want to respond to their invocation of the liberal construction canon?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes, a couple responses. I mean, liberal construction in light of its remedial purposes, but the one thing all nine of you should agree on, its remedial purposes did not extend to personal injuries. You've already said that twice, in the Clayton Act and in RJR Nabisco. It doesn't extend to remediate personal injury. Second of all, I think it's a tie-breaker. Their  -- their serious reading of the statute inserts the word ""injured in its person"" to read just like the Antiterrorism Act. And, finally, I think it does run up against the constitutional principle of federalism, that their view does cannibalize all of state tort law. Every -- every slip and fall from a mislabel now is a RICO case. So I think, I mean, that should be  -- the Court -- I mean, one more thing I'll try on that, the Court last cited that clause in 1985. I mean, it hasn't relied on it since and says you shouldn't use it to put RICO in contexts that Congress, you know, didn't want or couldn't have contemplated. And, here, it is just so  -- would be so striking to think that RICO remedied personal injuries.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say that under RICO, injury is ""the invasion of a legal right.""  So how would we go about determining  whether something is a legal right for this purpose?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, first, you look at the complaint. I think property's pretty easy because the Court has already said any monetary  loss is a property loss. So, I mean, you could quibble about whether loss of consortium, if state law defines that as a property loss. And then injury is also, I think, pretty easy  because that involves the body.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, what authorities would we look at?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh. Look at the complaint. Look at state law general tort principles. Again, that Burke case  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> General tort principles?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. What Burke said is -- which I like because it -- I think it works -- is that are the damages -- what are the damages seeking to redress?  Are the damages redressing a  --something that happened to the body, are they redressing stolen property, or  are they redressing a right to carry on in your business?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you rely a lot on WesternGeco. You mentioned it a  few minutes ago.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you ignore its language where they differentiate a patent case where the legal right is the right not to be infringed and where you feel the economic loss is different. And we said there that the Patent Act was different from civil RICO because the question in civil RICO is where the plaintiff feels the injury, in other words, where he suffers the economic harm that the damages compensate. So why should we think -- in -- in Sedima, we were very, very clear that RICO doesn't rely on state law -- state tort law concepts. We said that explicitly. What we  said was that RICO complicates injuries to have been caused by predicate acts. That's our --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and we explicitly -- explicitly say:  Not otherwise an  injury cognizable under state tort law.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's even better for me because our position is you shouldn't -- you can't get recovery that's -- that's caused by personal injury, which I think this case is. But, on RJR Nabisco -- sorry, the WesternGeco citing RJR Nabisco, I didn't --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that goes back to what Justice Jackson and  -- and what I tried earlier and Justice Kagan point out:  You're trying to say there's a difference between the two. But we've made very clear in WesternGeco there isn't. Injury is where you feel the harm. Now the question is:  What's the harm?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yegiazaryan said the opposite. Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as Justice Jackson said, the harm is not ingesting the drugs. That's the personal injury. The harm is from being fired. And whether there's a connection between the predicate acts and that harm  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- is a question of proximate cause, not a question of personal injury.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan is the most recent case where you said the injury was -- the inability to collect the California judgment was a domestic injury. You did not say it was the injury where all the effects were felt, which were a million different places  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that has nothing to do with the language of RICO -- of RICO, which says --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It was the language of</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- compensable injuries are the harms caused by predicate acts. And that's what we said in WesternGeco.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It's where you feel the harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan quotes that exact same language, and I think it's talk -- it begs the question about what is the harm talking about. Is it the harm that's the legal invasion of the right, or is it the damages at the end of the day?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask you about a hypo?  Because I'm still trying to understand your rule. You seem to be suggesting that the mere existence of physical harm renders any business injury not compensable. Is that  -- is that the  --do I have the sum total of your --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No?  Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because you just said --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So what is your rule?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --you just -- because you just said it's any personal injury renders the -- 40 damages  not recoverable. Obviously, if you have a business injury, a property injury, you can recover damages.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even if you have a physical injury too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely, because that's the example of a robbery. If you are thrown down a flight of stairs and they take your wallet, you have two injuries. You fell down the stairs and you lost your wallet.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You've got -- so you have a property injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- and a personal injury</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --two independent invasions.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and so, here, you say he took the drugs and that was an injury. And he says:  I was also fired. Why isn't that  two injuries too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because every  -- you would -- because -- because that conflates damages. Every personal injury, you could say I slip and fell --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But this is -- imagine that this is not damages in the following sense, all right?  If we have a case  in which he takes the drugs --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and, as a result of taking the drugs, he has to go to  the hospital, and, as a result of being in the hospital, he can't work.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I kind of understand the argument you're making. But, in this situation, he takes the drugs and there is no harm --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to him from taking the drugs.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me leave you with one more example. He goes to the hospital and he loses his sight and he can't drive anymore, so he gets fired. He still has a loss of employment. It is a damage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. But that's not this case. Nothing happened to him as a result of taking the drugs. Instead, what happened to him, I think -- and this is -- maybe I'm just not understanding.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he failed a drug test. It changed his -- well, allegedly, it had THC in it. I think it's the same thing as if you took something and had an allergic reaction. It's a physical, chemical, bodily invasion. He didn't want  -- he didn't want THC and he took it. It's like taking cocaine. That's a  -- to me, that's a physical injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S.

2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Yeah, but those are in other counts. Those are in the personal injury counts. And I think that matters, right?","<speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Thank you, and may it please the Court:  RICO states that any person injured in his business or property by reason of racketeering can sue therefor and recover threefold the damages he sustains. Because RICO's cause of action excludes personal injuries, RICO excludes damages resulting from personal injuries. The text differentiates the injury from racketeering and the damages sustained from that injury, thus showing that injury and damages are distinct. And the references to damages he sustains shows that damages are the losses suffere d as a result of the injury. Damages are not themselves the injury inflicted by the defendant. This distinction tracks this Court's recognition that lost wages and medical expenses are classic damages from personal injuries. Respondent's complaint alleges  the personal injury of unwanted ingestion of THC and the resulting damages of lost wages. To quote the complaint:  ""Defendant's behavior caused  Plaintiff's fiscal harm in the ingestion of Dixie, and as a direct result of consuming this  product, he was dismissed from his employment."" That's a personal injury claim outside civil RICO. Respondent argues that every economic loss is its own RICO injury but not to worry because RICO still bars non-pecuniary damages. But that view conflates injury and damages by treating RICO's exclusion of personal injuries as just excluding a narrow type of damages: pain and suffering and emotional distress. Respondent's rule also leaves the personal exclusion toothless since virtually all personal injuries result in monetary loss. It is utterly implausible that Congress federalized every slip and fall involving RICO predicates. Personal injuries are serious and may support state tort -- tort claims, but they are not the stuff of RICO. I welcome questions.</text>","<speaker>John G.

Personal injuries are serious and may support state tort -- tort claims, but they are not the stuff of RICO. I welcome questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> What does it mean to be injured, someone to be injured, in his business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> The Court  in -- in the Clayton Act case of Reiter talked about what -- injury to business, and it was referring to anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss, it would be both a right  -- a -- a injury to both business and property, a right to carry on business. Now the lower courts pre-RICO under the Clayton Act have also recognized that an employee has a business kind of a right to carry on in his employment, and we haven't contested that. So, in those cases, if you conspired to prevent  -- in those cases, they involved encyclopedic salesmen, deprived those people of their right to carry on their profession as a salesman, the -- the lower courts recognized that that was an injury to business. So it's a right to carry on, you know, a profession or your commercial enterprise.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Can loss of employment ever constitute a injury in business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, it's -- it certainly does in the Clayton Act. And the example I could think of, the only example that r eadily comes to mind, in RICO would be the human trafficking cases, where a person is forced to work against their will, and the -- there's an injury in your right to get, you know, the -- the payment for your performed work. So that would be an injury, a direct injury, to one's business. And that human trafficking  --it's hard to see how it would otherwis e come up unless you defrauded someone into quitting their job, but, generally, lost wages are pretty standard, prototypical damages from personal injury.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you're raising an example that leads me to think that what you're really arguing about is proximate cause, meaning -- and not really whether personal injury is recoverable or not. It is under, by your own admission, certain circumstances. And, in your brief, you list a bunch of examples that seem to me quintessential personal injuries, but you related them to the business loss and then said those were recoverable.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So personal --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So it doesn't make any sense to me to say a mob can threaten a store owner to take over his business and, if he doesn't, injure him and he can't recover, but if they put a bomb in the place and close it down, they close it down by hitting him or shooting him but then throw a bomb, he can recover for the bomb but not for the injury to himself.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So no one in  -- under this statute can ever recover for personal injuries, full stop, never ever. If there's an independent infringement  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But why?  Isn't --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of the right to property  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- isn't that an issue or shouldn't it be an issue of proximate cause, which wasn't reached in this case, correct?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, no, and here's why, because a lot of examples, the plaintiff will meet a direct and proximate cause, and I can start to give you a million, but they would  still be damages resulting from personal injury. Take your  -- a shooting where someone is shot and suffers medical expenses and can't work. Direct injury, sure, the lost wages and  medical expenses, but, still, it's damages resulting from personal injury, so a proximate cause --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But, no, there's a whole lot more to RICO than simply damages. There's also the predicate that you have to have a racketeering --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For sure.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- enterprise. You have to have willful intent. In product liability cases, most of those are negligence or strict liability, so you're not going to have willfulness or intent. And, similarly, you have to show proximate causation, reasonably foreseeable. There's a serious question as to whether you shoot someone not related to the enterprise and you cause damage, but another predicate act occurs that you're going to recover. --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, in your normal case of any personal injury, you read a -- misread --a label's confuse -- misleading, you're injured, you are  -- can't work, you have lost -- lost --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You're still not</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> That's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- you're still not answering my --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I guess what  -- so two things. You can always have causation, but there's still an independent requirement that you must be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> There has to be proximate causation  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes. And there's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- which is very different.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --plenty of proximate, direct, absolute causation, no ands, ifs, or buts, but it's still just a personal injury action that's outside the scope of RICO.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> You started by talking to Justice Thomas about what it means to be injured in your business or property. Now there  might be a set of questions there that this Court has not addressed, lower courts have, but  you said lower courts have said that to -- to lose a job is to be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. Sorry. To lose a job can be both damages or an injury. It depends on the na ture of the cause of action. So you always generally, with every personal injury, can have permanent job loss. You can have lost wages. Those are damages.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's also --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It is a very rare case  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's also a loss when  --you know, it's a -- it's a harm when I lose a job. You know, I've been harmed. I lost my job. And --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> When you pay medical expenses, you're harmed as well.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> If you're harmed when you lose a job, then you've been injured in your business, haven't you?  I mean, just as -- I -- I guess what I'm saying is the simplest, clearest reading of this statutory language is it doesn't -- it doesn't distinguish by what causes the harm. It  just says, if you're harmed in a way that's in your business or property, which has been understood to include being harmed by loss of a  job, and that's by reason of a violation of Section 1962, then you're entitled to threefold the damages you would otherwise be  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the problem with that is it's reading the statute just like the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Antiterrorism Act, to say any person injured in his person can recover threefold the damages. And the --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's not reading the statute the same way as injured in his person because, if  -- if all I come in and say is, you know, I suffered emotional distress or I suffered pain and suffering, I would not be entitled to damage  -- to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So that's an infinitesimal, small number of cases that would be excluded.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> It might be an infinitesimal, small number of cases. I'm just trying to figure out -- like, that's the most normal, natural reading of the statutory language. If you've been -- it doesn't say what  you've been injured by. I mean, you have to be injured by the RICO violation. But it doesn't  distinguish among different kinds of RICO violations. It just says, if you've been injured by a RICO violation in your business --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> In your business, right.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- which includes your employment, then you're entitled to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the only way to give the statute its normal meaning of ""damages sustained"" is to distinguish between the injury. If the Respondent had hit a tree because he was impaired from THC, that would be a classic personal injury action for lost wages and medical expenses. It sounds like you think maybe the Second Circuit is right. The Second Circuit seemed to think lost wages are always recoverable, but medical expenses never would be because that results from a physical injury. And, of course, property loss, the most fundamental of all property loss is monetary loss.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But I  --I think what  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> All personal injury actions result in monetary loss except, I guess, a case where there's just exclusively psychological damage. But every slip and fall  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, I -- I don't know exactly how your rule works because, if you don't read it that normal, straightforward way, then, you know, you  -- you get into all these -- you admit in a whole set of hypos that I can do something to you that we would normally classify as a personal injury and you would be entitled to RICO damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So, if I hit you and, as a resul t of that -- this is your car wash operator example -- there's an assault that's usually understood as a personal injury, but, as a result, you decide to do business with the mobster rather than with a legitimate businessman and you say, well, notwithstanding that it was all caused by an assault, which was a personal injury, you are entitled to RICO damages. And I think you could say the same thing here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's just not our argument.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, you could have  --you could have a proximate -- well, I don't know how you get to the answers of your hypotheticals if that's not your argument.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. Whenever you have a robbery where money is taken or an extortion where money is taken or kidnapping where ransom is taken, there are two independent infringements of your legal right. You have a right to not be hit or assaulted or whatever, you know, kidnapped, and you have a right not to have your money taken. And when money is taken, you get your money back under RICO because that's a monetary independent loss. You cannot recover for physical --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, money is taken as a result of the assault. The assault happens, and then you say:  Okay, I better do business with you. So, I mean, you're  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's why our test  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's a -- it's a consequential injury from the assault.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me give you an example. If you take the money and then shove the person down the stairs, you took the money. You may have shoved the person down the stairs to prevent them from getting their money back, but our test doesn't ask which --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But that's not your own hypos. Your own hypos are things like there's an assault, there's a kidnapping, there's a murder. All of those things are personal injuries that don't have any particular economic component. As a result of those things, you lose some business opportunities, and -- and you yourself say you get RICO under that  -- you get RICO damages under those hypotheticals. So this one  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You can --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- looks pretty much like that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. You can always get RICO damages for independent property violations. And, here, there is just an allege  of a right not to have -- not to be induced to consume THC. Our position is no different than the Clayton Act. It's the exact same rule. This Court, in the Truett versus Chrysler Motor Company case, said:  No damages resulting from personal injuries. That is our test.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. Blatt, can I  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you where you get your definition of ""legal injury""?  I mean, are you looking at just kind of general tort principles?  I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out exactly how you look at it and define it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Two -- two -- two places. So, when it says, you know, this RJR Nabisco and also just the statute, you can sue and you can  sue for a personal injury, that, to me, conjures up the infringement of a right. And in WesternGeco, when the Court talked about an infringement of the patent right, it called it ""the injury.""  In Yegiazaryan, when it talked about what the injury in that case was when trying to decide if there's a domestic injury, it talked about what the racketeering activity directly did to the plaintiff. And so injury as an infringement of a legal right is a -- I think we cite Ballentine, but that is a standard definition of ""injury.""</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Where does the ""legal"" in the ""legal right"" come from?  Are you looking kind of at general principles?  You're just looking at the nature of the harm?  Does it help you in terms of property or --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, I think it's just a question of federal law. I mean, so whether you have an injury to person, property, or business, that's a question of federal law that's informed by general tort principles.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So are you looking at, like, the Restatement?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You could in the Burke case that dealt with whether something was a  personal injury on  -- sorry, damages on account of personal injury. The Court looked at things like a Dobbs and Restatements, but it was a federal question on whether the damages resulted from the personal injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Why  --why aren't you looking  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and whether there was a per  -- whether  --whether discrimination under Title VII was, in fact, a personal injury or some other kind of injury. The Court looked at a bunch of state law sources, but it was a federal law question.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, I  -- I'm trying to understand the personal injury that you say was alleged or happened in this case. I did not perceive Mr. Horn to be relying on any sort of personal injury allegation with respect to the RICO count. He doesn't say, for example, that he took the THC and that he got ill from it and, as a result of that, he took off from work and then he got fired. He says, instead, just directly, that he  --let me see --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I think  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- alleges a pattern of mail and wire fraud related to your client's alleged fraud about whether the product took -- contained THC. He relied on that, and he got fired as a result. I don't see where personal injury is doing any work in his RICO claim.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think you're correct in the complaint that the allegations we're talking about, where he's talking about physical harm, it's talking about either the -- the allegations that are general. But page 21 of our brief goes into great detail of all the other places in his affidavit and in the RICO case statement  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah, but those are in other counts. Those are in the personal injury counts. And I think that matters, right?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, not in the RICO statement. The RICO statement, by definition, is the RICO claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm saying is the question presented in this case, that you've presented, is whether economic harms resulting from personal injuries are  injuries to business and property. So I'm trying to understand the allegation of personal injury here from which  the business harm results.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah, and I guess --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He doesn't say:  My injury is resulting from a personal injury. He says:  I'm injured because I got fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, his entire causation -- and, again, I'm not just quoting from the complaint. His affidavit  -- he needs to rely on the consumption or he doesn't have causation. Consumption is personal injury. But this was litigated at the cert stage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But does your test need to rely on the consumption?  I mean, suppose there was  --suppose the employer's rule.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think that's fair, you're right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So  -- but -- but that's why I'm sort of, with Justice Kagan, trying to understand your rule. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think our rule is, if there's no personal injury, we don't need to be here and have this discussion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm asking you -- let me ask you in a hypothetical.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> All right?  So suppose we have the same basic situation, but the employer's rule is that you can't possess --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- THC. Can't have it. And he looks at all of the advertising materials. He understands that your product does not have it based on your advertising materials, and so he buys it and he has it in his locker. I think this is an example  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that the Respondents came up with.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- because the -- the  --the employer says:  You have it. You're not supposed to have it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Does he have a RICO claim or not under those circumstances?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he doesn't have a RICO claim, but it wouldn't be covered by this case because there's no personal injury. It would be no different if he was  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. You're inserting personal injury. What I'm suggesting --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Your example doesn't involve a personal injury. Now, at most -- if I can just answer the direct question. If I was that person's lawyer, I would say:  You were injured in your business or property for the purchase price. You paid  --purchase price is a classic RICO injury, classic Clayton Act. He's entitled to three times his purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So you're saying he would have a RICO claim in --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He would  -- okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But lost wages aren't -- he doesn't rely on the law  -- he --and he would fail any kind of causation test if he tried to say:  I was f ired from the purchase price. He would ultimately fail causation under three of your Supreme Court cases that say there has to be a direct relationship between the conduc t that was done to the plaintiff and the lost claim. And there, you had the independent actor of the employer. It would be no different if the employer fired him for bei ng tricked into buying baby powder that, you know, didn't have the requisite -- it might -- he might have an injury, but he just wouldn't have a RICO claim because there would be lack of causation.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and isn't that essentially what's wrong with this case too, is what Justice Sotomayor was suggesting?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It does --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, there is a definite causation problem in this case.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> His -- his -- you know, he buys this thing. He ingests this  thing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And someone else fired him.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> A different person fires him. This is not a good RICO claim for that reason, but it has nothing to do with the reason that you're  giving.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, no, no, no, no. You can win for more than one reason, Justice Kagan. The Second Circuit held that a --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you're relying on an intuition that your client should win and Ms. Anand should lose. And that intuition may be a very valid one and  -- but the -- but the intuition works because there's no  proximate cause.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But all -- with all --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> The intuition does not work because he hasn't satisfied the business or property requirement because he has. He's been injured in his person or property --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, and with all due respect  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- by reason of a RICO violation.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- with all due respect, every classic slip-and-fall personal injury case, you could talk about causation clearly,  but it would still be the lost wages, you're fired because you either can't work because you're permanently disabled, or your employer fires you because you can no longer see or have an arm.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, maybe there's  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You still lose your job, but it's  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- maybe there's also an issue  --I mean, we haven't -- we haven't decided what this ""business or property"" phrase means. Maybe ""business or property""  doesn't mean lost wages. But, again, it -- that's a -- that's a second reason why you might win but also a reason that has nothing to do with the reason that you're articulating here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Just  -- Justice Kagan, the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit hold, if  you have a personal injury, and what the other side reads the statute to say anybody injured in his person, have at it under RICO; just don't assert economic damages. That flips the statute on its head. It doesn't say anything about being injured in your person. And, under their rule, all personal injuries are recoverable under RICO, which is an absurd not just intuitive proposition, but that cannot be within the contemplation --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Can I pick up --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of Congress.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- on Justice Barrett's question?  Because I think the other side says that injury, just ordinary meaning, means harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And you say that's wrong based on an idea that ""injury"" is a term of art, I think --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- in tort law. Can you elaborate on why injury does not equal harm?  Because that's --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- front and center in their brief.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- so I think injury could mean harm just as it means the -- the legal harm that was invaded. So I don't have a problem with the word ""harm.""  But what it doesn't mean  is loss in terms of any damage. And they have no meaning or independent distinction between ""injury"" and ""damages sustained.""  And I think inherent in that distinction between the injury that -- the injury that you sue over is the type of infringement. And you have to have  -- look, everyone agrees at least I think since you've said it twice under Clayton Act and RICO that the cause of action excludes personal injuries. So what does that mean?  We think it means what it says. It excludes personal injuries. So that means the damages from personal injuries. They say no, no, no, it includes personal injuries and it includes all damages from personal injuries.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why is this a damage from personal injury?  That's the part I don't understand. He's not claiming that he got  ill because of the product. He's not saying he was personally injured. He didn't even know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that he had ingested THC until the testing and the firing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Isn't that where his injury comes in?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think -- I mean, this was the  --this was what  the other side briefed to the Second Circuit and the Second Circuit didn't decide it. But, if I ate poppyseed bagels and failed a drug test, it's a personal injury. If I took a medicine like doxycycline, which is an antibiotic, and I can't be out in the sun and I lose my job as a lifeguard, it's a personal injury claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why are you saying that?  You can -- I mean, you're just saying that. I'm asking you, you know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Why am I saying it?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- there are -- there are personal injury claims that derive  from a person being harmed by -- by the ingestion of the product, right?  They're bodily, physically harmed because they have taken this thing. I don't read this claim to be that kind of injury. He's not saying that the  product itself injured him in any way.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think it is inconsistent with all of tort law to say a bodily invasion is not a personal injury just because you didn't have to go to the hospital or cough.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He voluntarily took the product.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, we all do.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He was not invaded. He  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> We all take products that can be mislabeled. We take them and we either get sick or we don't. But we all take products and we claim, yeah, but the label told me I wasn't going to have a side effect  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and I had the side effect.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- Ms. Blatt, if I might ask you a different question. You rely  heavily on the Clayton Act and -- and the similar language there. I went and looked at the Areeda -Hovenkamp, what they have to say about this.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, dear.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I know. I know. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah. ""Oh, dear"" is right. They say:  Reiter thus made plain that the business-or-property requirement is virtually always satisfied provided there's some kind  of injury that can properly be characterized as economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Well, I don't -- I mean, that's not right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I would go -- no.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- you just disagree with Areeda  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, yeah. No, that's definitely wro ng.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. Okay. Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely. And  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That' s all I need to know. Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. No. Wrong, wrong, wrong. And Reiter, I think, I mean, says  anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss it's going to be a business or injury. But let's  -- look, there are Clayton Act cases after Clayton  -- any -- any conspiracy to affect drug prices that result in a personal injury would mean treble damages under Clayton Act. That would be a sea change -- a sea change in Clayton Act if you had personal injury recovery for price-fixing.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So even Homer nods, the great Areeda and Hovenkamp treatise wrong?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely, because you would -- you would -- that would be, like I said, a sea change under Clayton Act. I mean, it might be a boondoggle for plaintiffs' lawyers, but I think it would freak everyone else out.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, aren't you estopped from claiming that he has a personal injury here when below you argued or  your client argued that he had no personal injury, which is why all the personal injury claims were dismissed?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I don't understand how you can have it both ways.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. On page 113 of the Pet. App., the district court is recognizing that we argued, and the court said, there's no cognizable injury. But, on pages 49 and 50, which I think is pretty bad for the other side, the court is saying but there's clearly a -- this is a classic personal injury claim, which is why he can get lost wages for fraud.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. I'm talking about what you argued. Your client argued, to get rid of the personal injury claims, that he had no personal injury; the only thing was economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So -- so --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And so now that he's left with the economic, you say no, there is a personal injury and he can't get damages for that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Sorry. On pages 49 and 50, it goes through how we, the defendants, are arguing th is is a personal injury claim. So we did argue it was a personal injury claim. We  claimed what we're talking about before, there's no cognizable personal injury. It's like saying  emotional damage, it's not -- it doesn't count because you didn't have  --it didn't manifest itself in physical. So I don't think we're estopped. If you want to let that, I guess, I don't know, reverse, you'd have to reverse the rule and then decide if we're estopped, but I don't -- I'm not sure how that would work out if that's what you thought.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Do you want to respond to their invocation of the liberal construction canon?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes, a couple responses. I mean, liberal construction in light of its remedial purposes, but the one thing all nine of you should agree on, its remedial purposes did not extend to personal injuries. You've already said that twice, in the Clayton Act and in RJR Nabisco. It doesn't extend to remediate personal injury. Second of all, I think it's a tie-breaker. Their  -- their serious reading of the statute inserts the word ""injured in its person"" to read just like the Antiterrorism Act. And, finally, I think it does run up against the constitutional principle of federalism, that their view does cannibalize all of state tort law. Every -- every slip and fall from a mislabel now is a RICO case. So I think, I mean, that should be  -- the Court -- I mean, one more thing I'll try on that, the Court last cited that clause in 1985. I mean, it hasn't relied on it since and says you shouldn't use it to put RICO in contexts that Congress, you know, didn't want or couldn't have contemplated. And, here, it is just so  -- would be so striking to think that RICO remedied personal injuries.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say that under RICO, injury is ""the invasion of a legal right.""  So how would we go about determining  whether something is a legal right for this purpose?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, first, you look at the complaint. I think property's pretty easy because the Court has already said any monetary  loss is a property loss. So, I mean, you could quibble about whether loss of consortium, if state law defines that as a property loss. And then injury is also, I think, pretty easy  because that involves the body.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, what authorities would we look at?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh. Look at the complaint. Look at state law general tort principles. Again, that Burke case  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> General tort principles?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. What Burke said is -- which I like because it -- I think it works -- is that are the damages -- what are the damages seeking to redress?  Are the damages redressing a  --something that happened to the body, are they redressing stolen property, or  are they redressing a right to carry on in your business?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you rely a lot on WesternGeco. You mentioned it a  few minutes ago.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you ignore its language where they differentiate a patent case where the legal right is the right not to be infringed and where you feel the economic loss is different. And we said there that the Patent Act was different from civil RICO because the question in civil RICO is where the plaintiff feels the injury, in other words, where he suffers the economic harm that the damages compensate. So why should we think -- in -- in Sedima, we were very, very clear that RICO doesn't rely on state law -- state tort law concepts. We said that explicitly. What we  said was that RICO complicates injuries to have been caused by predicate acts. That's our --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and we explicitly -- explicitly say:  Not otherwise an  injury cognizable under state tort law.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's even better for me because our position is you shouldn't -- you can't get recovery that's -- that's caused by personal injury, which I think this case is. But, on RJR Nabisco -- sorry, the WesternGeco citing RJR Nabisco, I didn't --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that goes back to what Justice Jackson and  -- and what I tried earlier and Justice Kagan point out:  You're trying to say there's a difference between the two. But we've made very clear in WesternGeco there isn't. Injury is where you feel the harm. Now the question is:  What's the harm?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yegiazaryan said the opposite. Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as Justice Jackson said, the harm is not ingesting the drugs. That's the personal injury. The harm is from being fired. And whether there's a connection between the predicate acts and that harm  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- is a question of proximate cause, not a question of personal injury.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan is the most recent case where you said the injury was -- the inability to collect the California judgment was a domestic injury. You did not say it was the injury where all the effects were felt, which were a million different places  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that has nothing to do with the language of RICO -- of RICO, which says --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It was the language of</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- compensable injuries are the harms caused by predicate acts. And that's what we said in WesternGeco.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It's where you feel the harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan quotes that exact same language, and I think it's talk -- it begs the question about what is the harm talking about. Is it the harm that's the legal invasion of the right, or is it the damages at the end of the day?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask you about a hypo?  Because I'm still trying to understand your rule. You seem to be suggesting that the mere existence of physical harm renders any business injury not compensable. Is that  -- is that the  --do I have the sum total of your --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No?  Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because you just said --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So what is your rule?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --you just -- because you just said it's any personal injury renders the -- 40 damages  not recoverable. Obviously, if you have a business injury, a property injury, you can recover damages.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even if you have a physical injury too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely, because that's the example of a robbery. If you are thrown down a flight of stairs and they take your wallet, you have two injuries. You fell down the stairs and you lost your wallet.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You've got -- so you have a property injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- and a personal injury</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --two independent invasions.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and so, here, you say he took the drugs and that was an injury. And he says:  I was also fired. Why isn't that  two injuries too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because every  -- you would -- because -- because that conflates damages. Every personal injury, you could say I slip and fell --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But this is -- imagine that this is not damages in the following sense, all right?  If we have a case  in which he takes the drugs --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and, as a result of taking the drugs, he has to go to  the hospital, and, as a result of being in the hospital, he can't work.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I kind of understand the argument you're making. But, in this situation, he takes the drugs and there is no harm --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to him from taking the drugs.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me leave you with one more example. He goes to the hospital and he loses his sight and he can't drive anymore, so he gets fired. He still has a loss of employment. It is a damage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. But that's not this case. Nothing happened to him as a result of taking the drugs. Instead, what happened to him, I think -- and this is -- maybe I'm just not understanding.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he failed a drug test. It changed his -- well, allegedly, it had THC in it. I think it's the same thing as if you took something and had an allergic reaction. It's a physical, chemical, bodily invasion. He didn't want  -- he didn't want THC and he took it. It's like taking cocaine. That's a  -- to me, that's a physical injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- whether or not you hid something.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anand.</text>",coherent

Blatt</speaker><text> Thank you, and may it please the Court:  RICO states that any person injured in his business or property by reason of racketeering can sue therefor and recover threefold the damages he sustains. Because RICO's cause of action excludes personal injuries, RICO excludes damages resulting from personal injuries. The text differentiates the injury from racketeering and the damages sustained from that injury, thus showing that injury and damages are distinct. And the references to damages he sustains shows that damages are the losses suffere d as a result of the injury. Damages are not themselves the injury inflicted by the defendant. This distinction tracks this Court's recognition that lost wages and medical expenses are classic damages from personal injuries.

That's a personal injury claim outside civil RICO. Respondent argues that every economic loss is its own RICO injury but not to worry because RICO still bars non-pecuniary damages. But that view conflates injury and damages by treating RICO's exclusion of personal injuries as just excluding a narrow type of damages: pain and suffering and emotional distress. Respondent's rule also leaves the personal exclusion toothless since virtually all personal injuries result in monetary loss.

I welcome questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> What does it mean to be injured, someone to be injured, in his business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> The Court  in -- in the Clayton Act case of Reiter talked about what -- injury to business, and it was referring to anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss, it would be both a right  -- a -- a injury to both business and property, a right to carry on business. Now the lower courts pre-RICO under the Clayton Act have also recognized that an employee has a business kind of a right to carry on in his employment, and we haven't contested that. So, in those cases, if you conspired to prevent  -- in those cases, they involved encyclopedic salesmen, deprived those people of their right to carry on their profession as a salesman, the -- the lower courts recognized that that was an injury to business. So it's a right to carry on, you know, a profession or your commercial enterprise.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Can loss of employment ever constitute a injury in business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, it's -- it certainly does in the Clayton Act. And the example I could think of, the only example that r eadily comes to mind, in RICO would be the human trafficking cases, where a person is forced to work against their will, and the -- there's an injury in your right to get, you know, the -- the payment for your performed work. So that would be an injury, a direct injury, to one's business. And that human trafficking  --it's hard to see how it would otherwis e come up unless you defrauded someone into quitting their job, but, generally, lost wages are pretty standard, prototypical damages from personal injury.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you're raising an example that leads me to think that what you're really arguing about is proximate cause, meaning -- and not really whether personal injury is recoverable or not. It is under, by your own admission, certain circumstances. And, in your brief, you list a bunch of examples that seem to me quintessential personal injuries, but you related them to the business loss and then said those were recoverable.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So personal --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So it doesn't make any sense to me to say a mob can threaten a store owner to take over his business and, if he doesn't, injure him and he can't recover, but if they put a bomb in the place and close it down, they close it down by hitting him or shooting him but then throw a bomb, he can recover for the bomb but not for the injury to himself.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So no one in  -- under this statute can ever recover for personal injuries, full stop, never ever. If there's an independent infringement  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But why?  Isn't --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of the right to property  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- isn't that an issue or shouldn't it be an issue of proximate cause, which wasn't reached in this case, correct?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, no, and here's why, because a lot of examples, the plaintiff will meet a direct and proximate cause, and I can start to give you a million, but they would  still be damages resulting from personal injury. Take your  -- a shooting where someone is shot and suffers medical expenses and can't work. Direct injury, sure, the lost wages and  medical expenses, but, still, it's damages resulting from personal injury, so a proximate cause --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But, no, there's a whole lot more to RICO than simply damages. There's also the predicate that you have to have a racketeering --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For sure.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- enterprise. You have to have willful intent. In product liability cases, most of those are negligence or strict liability, so you're not going to have willfulness or intent. And, similarly, you have to show proximate causation, reasonably foreseeable. There's a serious question as to whether you shoot someone not related to the enterprise and you cause damage, but another predicate act occurs that you're going to recover. --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, in your normal case of any personal injury, you read a -- misread --a label's confuse -- misleading, you're injured, you are  -- can't work, you have lost -- lost --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You're still not</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> That's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- you're still not answering my --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I guess what  -- so two things. You can always have causation, but there's still an independent requirement that you must be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> There has to be proximate causation  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes. And there's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- which is very different.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --plenty of proximate, direct, absolute causation, no ands, ifs, or buts, but it's still just a personal injury action that's outside the scope of RICO.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> You started by talking to Justice Thomas about what it means to be injured in your business or property. Now there  might be a set of questions there that this Court has not addressed, lower courts have, but  you said lower courts have said that to -- to lose a job is to be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. Sorry. To lose a job can be both damages or an injury. It depends on the na ture of the cause of action. So you always generally, with every personal injury, can have permanent job loss. You can have lost wages. Those are damages.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's also --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It is a very rare case  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's also a loss when  --you know, it's a -- it's a harm when I lose a job. You know, I've been harmed. I lost my job. And --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> When you pay medical expenses, you're harmed as well.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> If you're harmed when you lose a job, then you've been injured in your business, haven't you?  I mean, just as -- I -- I guess what I'm saying is the simplest, clearest reading of this statutory language is it doesn't -- it doesn't distinguish by what causes the harm. It  just says, if you're harmed in a way that's in your business or property, which has been understood to include being harmed by loss of a  job, and that's by reason of a violation of Section 1962, then you're entitled to threefold the damages you would otherwise be  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the problem with that is it's reading the statute just like the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Antiterrorism Act, to say any person injured in his person can recover threefold the damages. And the --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's not reading the statute the same way as injured in his person because, if  -- if all I come in and say is, you know, I suffered emotional distress or I suffered pain and suffering, I would not be entitled to damage  -- to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So that's an infinitesimal, small number of cases that would be excluded.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> It might be an infinitesimal, small number of cases. I'm just trying to figure out -- like, that's the most normal, natural reading of the statutory language. If you've been -- it doesn't say what  you've been injured by. I mean, you have to be injured by the RICO violation. But it doesn't  distinguish among different kinds of RICO violations. It just says, if you've been injured by a RICO violation in your business --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> In your business, right.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- which includes your employment, then you're entitled to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the only way to give the statute its normal meaning of ""damages sustained"" is to distinguish between the injury. If the Respondent had hit a tree because he was impaired from THC, that would be a classic personal injury action for lost wages and medical expenses. It sounds like you think maybe the Second Circuit is right. The Second Circuit seemed to think lost wages are always recoverable, but medical expenses never would be because that results from a physical injury. And, of course, property loss, the most fundamental of all property loss is monetary loss.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But I  --I think what  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> All personal injury actions result in monetary loss except, I guess, a case where there's just exclusively psychological damage. But every slip and fall  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, I -- I don't know exactly how your rule works because, if you don't read it that normal, straightforward way, then, you know, you  -- you get into all these -- you admit in a whole set of hypos that I can do something to you that we would normally classify as a personal injury and you would be entitled to RICO damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So, if I hit you and, as a resul t of that -- this is your car wash operator example -- there's an assault that's usually understood as a personal injury, but, as a result, you decide to do business with the mobster rather than with a legitimate businessman and you say, well, notwithstanding that it was all caused by an assault, which was a personal injury, you are entitled to RICO damages. And I think you could say the same thing here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's just not our argument.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, you could have  --you could have a proximate -- well, I don't know how you get to the answers of your hypotheticals if that's not your argument.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. Whenever you have a robbery where money is taken or an extortion where money is taken or kidnapping where ransom is taken, there are two independent infringements of your legal right. You have a right to not be hit or assaulted or whatever, you know, kidnapped, and you have a right not to have your money taken. And when money is taken, you get your money back under RICO because that's a monetary independent loss. You cannot recover for physical --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, money is taken as a result of the assault. The assault happens, and then you say:  Okay, I better do business with you. So, I mean, you're  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's why our test  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's a -- it's a consequential injury from the assault.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me give you an example. If you take the money and then shove the person down the stairs, you took the money. You may have shoved the person down the stairs to prevent them from getting their money back, but our test doesn't ask which --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But that's not your own hypos. Your own hypos are things like there's an assault, there's a kidnapping, there's a murder. All of those things are personal injuries that don't have any particular economic component. As a result of those things, you lose some business opportunities, and -- and you yourself say you get RICO under that  -- you get RICO damages under those hypotheticals. So this one  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You can --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- looks pretty much like that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. You can always get RICO damages for independent property violations. And, here, there is just an allege  of a right not to have -- not to be induced to consume THC. Our position is no different than the Clayton Act. It's the exact same rule. This Court, in the Truett versus Chrysler Motor Company case, said:  No damages resulting from personal injuries. That is our test.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. Blatt, can I  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you where you get your definition of ""legal injury""?  I mean, are you looking at just kind of general tort principles?  I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out exactly how you look at it and define it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Two -- two -- two places. So, when it says, you know, this RJR Nabisco and also just the statute, you can sue and you can  sue for a personal injury, that, to me, conjures up the infringement of a right. And in WesternGeco, when the Court talked about an infringement of the patent right, it called it ""the injury.""  In Yegiazaryan, when it talked about what the injury in that case was when trying to decide if there's a domestic injury, it talked about what the racketeering activity directly did to the plaintiff. And so injury as an infringement of a legal right is a -- I think we cite Ballentine, but that is a standard definition of ""injury.""</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Where does the ""legal"" in the ""legal right"" come from?  Are you looking kind of at general principles?  You're just looking at the nature of the harm?  Does it help you in terms of property or --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, I think it's just a question of federal law. I mean, so whether you have an injury to person, property, or business, that's a question of federal law that's informed by general tort principles.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So are you looking at, like, the Restatement?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You could in the Burke case that dealt with whether something was a  personal injury on  -- sorry, damages on account of personal injury. The Court looked at things like a Dobbs and Restatements, but it was a federal question on whether the damages resulted from the personal injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Why  --why aren't you looking  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and whether there was a per  -- whether  --whether discrimination under Title VII was, in fact, a personal injury or some other kind of injury. The Court looked at a bunch of state law sources, but it was a federal law question.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, I  -- I'm trying to understand the personal injury that you say was alleged or happened in this case. I did not perceive Mr. Horn to be relying on any sort of personal injury allegation with respect to the RICO count. He doesn't say, for example, that he took the THC and that he got ill from it and, as a result of that, he took off from work and then he got fired. He says, instead, just directly, that he  --let me see --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I think  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- alleges a pattern of mail and wire fraud related to your client's alleged fraud about whether the product took -- contained THC. He relied on that, and he got fired as a result. I don't see where personal injury is doing any work in his RICO claim.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think you're correct in the complaint that the allegations we're talking about, where he's talking about physical harm, it's talking about either the -- the allegations that are general. But page 21 of our brief goes into great detail of all the other places in his affidavit and in the RICO case statement  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah, but those are in other counts. Those are in the personal injury counts. And I think that matters, right?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, not in the RICO statement. The RICO statement, by definition, is the RICO claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm saying is the question presented in this case, that you've presented, is whether economic harms resulting from personal injuries are  injuries to business and property. So I'm trying to understand the allegation of personal injury here from which  the business harm results.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah, and I guess --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He doesn't say:  My injury is resulting from a personal injury. He says:  I'm injured because I got fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, his entire causation -- and, again, I'm not just quoting from the complaint. His affidavit  -- he needs to rely on the consumption or he doesn't have causation. Consumption is personal injury. But this was litigated at the cert stage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But does your test need to rely on the consumption?  I mean, suppose there was  --suppose the employer's rule.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think that's fair, you're right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So  -- but -- but that's why I'm sort of, with Justice Kagan, trying to understand your rule. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think our rule is, if there's no personal injury, we don't need to be here and have this discussion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm asking you -- let me ask you in a hypothetical.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> All right?  So suppose we have the same basic situation, but the employer's rule is that you can't possess --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- THC. Can't have it. And he looks at all of the advertising materials. He understands that your product does not have it based on your advertising materials, and so he buys it and he has it in his locker. I think this is an example  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that the Respondents came up with.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- because the -- the  --the employer says:  You have it. You're not supposed to have it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Does he have a RICO claim or not under those circumstances?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he doesn't have a RICO claim, but it wouldn't be covered by this case because there's no personal injury. It would be no different if he was  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. You're inserting personal injury. What I'm suggesting --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Your example doesn't involve a personal injury. Now, at most -- if I can just answer the direct question. If I was that person's lawyer, I would say:  You were injured in your business or property for the purchase price. You paid  --purchase price is a classic RICO injury, classic Clayton Act. He's entitled to three times his purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So you're saying he would have a RICO claim in --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He would  -- okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But lost wages aren't -- he doesn't rely on the law  -- he --and he would fail any kind of causation test if he tried to say:  I was f ired from the purchase price. He would ultimately fail causation under three of your Supreme Court cases that say there has to be a direct relationship between the conduc t that was done to the plaintiff and the lost claim. And there, you had the independent actor of the employer. It would be no different if the employer fired him for bei ng tricked into buying baby powder that, you know, didn't have the requisite -- it might -- he might have an injury, but he just wouldn't have a RICO claim because there would be lack of causation.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and isn't that essentially what's wrong with this case too, is what Justice Sotomayor was suggesting?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It does --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, there is a definite causation problem in this case.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> His -- his -- you know, he buys this thing. He ingests this  thing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And someone else fired him.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> A different person fires him. This is not a good RICO claim for that reason, but it has nothing to do with the reason that you're  giving.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, no, no, no, no. You can win for more than one reason, Justice Kagan. The Second Circuit held that a --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you're relying on an intuition that your client should win and Ms. Anand should lose. And that intuition may be a very valid one and  -- but the -- but the intuition works because there's no  proximate cause.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But all -- with all --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> The intuition does not work because he hasn't satisfied the business or property requirement because he has. He's been injured in his person or property --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, and with all due respect  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- by reason of a RICO violation.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- with all due respect, every classic slip-and-fall personal injury case, you could talk about causation clearly,  but it would still be the lost wages, you're fired because you either can't work because you're permanently disabled, or your employer fires you because you can no longer see or have an arm.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, maybe there's  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You still lose your job, but it's  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- maybe there's also an issue  --I mean, we haven't -- we haven't decided what this ""business or property"" phrase means. Maybe ""business or property""  doesn't mean lost wages. But, again, it -- that's a -- that's a second reason why you might win but also a reason that has nothing to do with the reason that you're articulating here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Just  -- Justice Kagan, the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit hold, if  you have a personal injury, and what the other side reads the statute to say anybody injured in his person, have at it under RICO; just don't assert economic damages. That flips the statute on its head. It doesn't say anything about being injured in your person. And, under their rule, all personal injuries are recoverable under RICO, which is an absurd not just intuitive proposition, but that cannot be within the contemplation --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Can I pick up --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of Congress.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- on Justice Barrett's question?  Because I think the other side says that injury, just ordinary meaning, means harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And you say that's wrong based on an idea that ""injury"" is a term of art, I think --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- in tort law. Can you elaborate on why injury does not equal harm?  Because that's --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- front and center in their brief.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- so I think injury could mean harm just as it means the -- the legal harm that was invaded. So I don't have a problem with the word ""harm.""  But what it doesn't mean  is loss in terms of any damage. And they have no meaning or independent distinction between ""injury"" and ""damages sustained.""  And I think inherent in that distinction between the injury that -- the injury that you sue over is the type of infringement. And you have to have  -- look, everyone agrees at least I think since you've said it twice under Clayton Act and RICO that the cause of action excludes personal injuries. So what does that mean?  We think it means what it says. It excludes personal injuries. So that means the damages from personal injuries. They say no, no, no, it includes personal injuries and it includes all damages from personal injuries.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why is this a damage from personal injury?  That's the part I don't understand. He's not claiming that he got  ill because of the product. He's not saying he was personally injured. He didn't even know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that he had ingested THC until the testing and the firing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Isn't that where his injury comes in?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think -- I mean, this was the  --this was what  the other side briefed to the Second Circuit and the Second Circuit didn't decide it. But, if I ate poppyseed bagels and failed a drug test, it's a personal injury. If I took a medicine like doxycycline, which is an antibiotic, and I can't be out in the sun and I lose my job as a lifeguard, it's a personal injury claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why are you saying that?  You can -- I mean, you're just saying that. I'm asking you, you know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Why am I saying it?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- there are -- there are personal injury claims that derive  from a person being harmed by -- by the ingestion of the product, right?  They're bodily, physically harmed because they have taken this thing. I don't read this claim to be that kind of injury. He's not saying that the  product itself injured him in any way.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think it is inconsistent with all of tort law to say a bodily invasion is not a personal injury just because you didn't have to go to the hospital or cough.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He voluntarily took the product.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, we all do.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He was not invaded. He  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> We all take products that can be mislabeled. We take them and we either get sick or we don't. But we all take products and we claim, yeah, but the label told me I wasn't going to have a side effect  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and I had the side effect.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- Ms. Blatt, if I might ask you a different question. You rely  heavily on the Clayton Act and -- and the similar language there. I went and looked at the Areeda -Hovenkamp, what they have to say about this.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, dear.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I know. I know. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah. ""Oh, dear"" is right. They say:  Reiter thus made plain that the business-or-property requirement is virtually always satisfied provided there's some kind  of injury that can properly be characterized as economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Well, I don't -- I mean, that's not right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I would go -- no.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- you just disagree with Areeda  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, yeah. No, that's definitely wro ng.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. Okay. Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely. And  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That' s all I need to know. Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. No. Wrong, wrong, wrong. And Reiter, I think, I mean, says  anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss it's going to be a business or injury. But let's  -- look, there are Clayton Act cases after Clayton  -- any -- any conspiracy to affect drug prices that result in a personal injury would mean treble damages under Clayton Act. That would be a sea change -- a sea change in Clayton Act if you had personal injury recovery for price-fixing.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So even Homer nods, the great Areeda and Hovenkamp treatise wrong?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely, because you would -- you would -- that would be, like I said, a sea change under Clayton Act. I mean, it might be a boondoggle for plaintiffs' lawyers, but I think it would freak everyone else out.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, aren't you estopped from claiming that he has a personal injury here when below you argued or  your client argued that he had no personal injury, which is why all the personal injury claims were dismissed?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I don't understand how you can have it both ways.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. On page 113 of the Pet. App., the district court is recognizing that we argued, and the court said, there's no cognizable injury. But, on pages 49 and 50, which I think is pretty bad for the other side, the court is saying but there's clearly a -- this is a classic personal injury claim, which is why he can get lost wages for fraud.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. I'm talking about what you argued. Your client argued, to get rid of the personal injury claims, that he had no personal injury; the only thing was economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So -- so --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And so now that he's left with the economic, you say no, there is a personal injury and he can't get damages for that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Sorry. On pages 49 and 50, it goes through how we, the defendants, are arguing th is is a personal injury claim. So we did argue it was a personal injury claim. We  claimed what we're talking about before, there's no cognizable personal injury. It's like saying  emotional damage, it's not -- it doesn't count because you didn't have  --it didn't manifest itself in physical. So I don't think we're estopped. If you want to let that, I guess, I don't know, reverse, you'd have to reverse the rule and then decide if we're estopped, but I don't -- I'm not sure how that would work out if that's what you thought.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Do you want to respond to their invocation of the liberal construction canon?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes, a couple responses. I mean, liberal construction in light of its remedial purposes, but the one thing all nine of you should agree on, its remedial purposes did not extend to personal injuries. You've already said that twice, in the Clayton Act and in RJR Nabisco. It doesn't extend to remediate personal injury. Second of all, I think it's a tie-breaker. Their  -- their serious reading of the statute inserts the word ""injured in its person"" to read just like the Antiterrorism Act. And, finally, I think it does run up against the constitutional principle of federalism, that their view does cannibalize all of state tort law. Every -- every slip and fall from a mislabel now is a RICO case. So I think, I mean, that should be  -- the Court -- I mean, one more thing I'll try on that, the Court last cited that clause in 1985. I mean, it hasn't relied on it since and says you shouldn't use it to put RICO in contexts that Congress, you know, didn't want or couldn't have contemplated. And, here, it is just so  -- would be so striking to think that RICO remedied personal injuries.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say that under RICO, injury is ""the invasion of a legal right.""  So how would we go about determining  whether something is a legal right for this purpose?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, first, you look at the complaint. I think property's pretty easy because the Court has already said any monetary  loss is a property loss. So, I mean, you could quibble about whether loss of consortium, if state law defines that as a property loss. And then injury is also, I think, pretty easy  because that involves the body.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, what authorities would we look at?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh. Look at the complaint. Look at state law general tort principles. Again, that Burke case  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> General tort principles?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. What Burke said is -- which I like because it -- I think it works -- is that are the damages -- what are the damages seeking to redress?  Are the damages redressing a  --something that happened to the body, are they redressing stolen property, or  are they redressing a right to carry on in your business?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you rely a lot on WesternGeco. You mentioned it a  few minutes ago.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you ignore its language where they differentiate a patent case where the legal right is the right not to be infringed and where you feel the economic loss is different. And we said there that the Patent Act was different from civil RICO because the question in civil RICO is where the plaintiff feels the injury, in other words, where he suffers the economic harm that the damages compensate. So why should we think -- in -- in Sedima, we were very, very clear that RICO doesn't rely on state law -- state tort law concepts. We said that explicitly. What we  said was that RICO complicates injuries to have been caused by predicate acts. That's our --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and we explicitly -- explicitly say:  Not otherwise an  injury cognizable under state tort law.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's even better for me because our position is you shouldn't -- you can't get recovery that's -- that's caused by personal injury, which I think this case is. But, on RJR Nabisco -- sorry, the WesternGeco citing RJR Nabisco, I didn't --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that goes back to what Justice Jackson and  -- and what I tried earlier and Justice Kagan point out:  You're trying to say there's a difference between the two. But we've made very clear in WesternGeco there isn't. Injury is where you feel the harm. Now the question is:  What's the harm?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yegiazaryan said the opposite. Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as Justice Jackson said, the harm is not ingesting the drugs. That's the personal injury. The harm is from being fired. And whether there's a connection between the predicate acts and that harm  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- is a question of proximate cause, not a question of personal injury.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan is the most recent case where you said the injury was -- the inability to collect the California judgment was a domestic injury. You did not say it was the injury where all the effects were felt, which were a million different places  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that has nothing to do with the language of RICO -- of RICO, which says --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It was the language of</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- compensable injuries are the harms caused by predicate acts. And that's what we said in WesternGeco.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It's where you feel the harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan quotes that exact same language, and I think it's talk -- it begs the question about what is the harm talking about.

Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask you about a hypo?

Blatt</speaker><text> Because you just said --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So what is your rule?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --you just -- because you just said it's any personal injury renders the -- 40 damages  not recoverable. Obviously, if you have a business injury, a property injury, you can recover damages.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even if you have a physical injury too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely, because that's the example of a robbery. If you are thrown down a flight of stairs and they take your wallet, you have two injuries. You fell down the stairs and you lost your wallet.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You've got -- so you have a property injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- and a personal injury</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --two independent invasions.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and so, here, you say he took the drugs and that was an injury. And he says:  I was also fired. Why isn't that  two injuries too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because every  -- you would -- because -- because that conflates damages. Every personal injury, you could say I slip and fell --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But this is -- imagine that this is not damages in the following sense, all right?  If we have a case  in which he takes the drugs --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and, as a result of taking the drugs, he has to go to  the hospital, and, as a result of being in the hospital, he can't work.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I kind of understand the argument you're making. But, in this situation, he takes the drugs and there is no harm --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to him from taking the drugs.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me leave you with one more example. He goes to the hospital and he loses his sight and he can't drive anymore, so he gets fired. He still has a loss of employment. It is a damage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. But that's not this case. Nothing happened to him as a result of taking the drugs. Instead, what happened to him, I think -- and this is -- maybe I'm just not understanding.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he failed a drug test. It changed his -- well, allegedly, it had THC in it. I think it's the same thing as if you took something and had an allergic reaction. It's a physical, chemical, bodily invasion. He didn't want  -- he didn't want THC and he took it. It's like taking cocaine. That's a  -- to me, that's a physical injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S.

The text differentiates the injury from racketeering and the damages sustained from that injury, thus showing that injury and damages are distinct. And the references to damages he sustains shows that damages are the losses suffere d as a result of the injury. Damages are not themselves the injury inflicted by the defendant.

That's a personal injury claim outside civil RICO. Respondent argues that every economic loss is its own RICO injury but not to worry because RICO still bars non-pecuniary damages. But that view conflates injury and damages by treating RICO's exclusion of personal injuries as just excluding a narrow type of damages: pain and suffering and emotional distress. Respondent's rule also leaves the personal exclusion toothless since virtually all personal injuries result in monetary loss.

Personal injuries are serious and may support state tort -- tort claims, but they are not the stuff of RICO. I welcome questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> What does it mean to be injured, someone to be injured, in his business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> The Court  in -- in the Clayton Act case of Reiter talked about what -- injury to business, and it was referring to anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss, it would be both a right  -- a -- a injury to both business and property, a right to carry on business. Now the lower courts pre-RICO under the Clayton Act have also recognized that an employee has a business kind of a right to carry on in his employment, and we haven't contested that. So, in those cases, if you conspired to prevent  -- in those cases, they involved encyclopedic salesmen, deprived those people of their right to carry on their profession as a salesman, the -- the lower courts recognized that that was an injury to business. So it's a right to carry on, you know, a profession or your commercial enterprise.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Can loss of employment ever constitute a injury in business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, it's -- it certainly does in the Clayton Act. And the example I could think of, the only example that r eadily comes to mind, in RICO would be the human trafficking cases, where a person is forced to work against their will, and the -- there's an injury in your right to get, you know, the -- the payment for your performed work. So that would be an injury, a direct injury, to one's business. And that human trafficking  --it's hard to see how it would otherwis e come up unless you defrauded someone into quitting their job, but, generally, lost wages are pretty standard, prototypical damages from personal injury.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you're raising an example that leads me to think that what you're really arguing about is proximate cause, meaning -- and not really whether personal injury is recoverable or not. It is under, by your own admission, certain circumstances. And, in your brief, you list a bunch of examples that seem to me quintessential personal injuries, but you related them to the business loss and then said those were recoverable.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So personal --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So it doesn't make any sense to me to say a mob can threaten a store owner to take over his business and, if he doesn't, injure him and he can't recover, but if they put a bomb in the place and close it down, they close it down by hitting him or shooting him but then throw a bomb, he can recover for the bomb but not for the injury to himself.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So no one in  -- under this statute can ever recover for personal injuries, full stop, never ever. If there's an independent infringement  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But why?  Isn't --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of the right to property  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- isn't that an issue or shouldn't it be an issue of proximate cause, which wasn't reached in this case, correct?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, no, and here's why, because a lot of examples, the plaintiff will meet a direct and proximate cause, and I can start to give you a million, but they would  still be damages resulting from personal injury. Take your  -- a shooting where someone is shot and suffers medical expenses and can't work. Direct injury, sure, the lost wages and  medical expenses, but, still, it's damages resulting from personal injury, so a proximate cause --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But, no, there's a whole lot more to RICO than simply damages. There's also the predicate that you have to have a racketeering --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For sure.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- enterprise. You have to have willful intent. In product liability cases, most of those are negligence or strict liability, so you're not going to have willfulness or intent. And, similarly, you have to show proximate causation, reasonably foreseeable. There's a serious question as to whether you shoot someone not related to the enterprise and you cause damage, but another predicate act occurs that you're going to recover. --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, in your normal case of any personal injury, you read a -- misread --a label's confuse -- misleading, you're injured, you are  -- can't work, you have lost -- lost --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You're still not</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> That's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- you're still not answering my --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I guess what  -- so two things. You can always have causation, but there's still an independent requirement that you must be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> There has to be proximate causation  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes. And there's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- which is very different.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --plenty of proximate, direct, absolute causation, no ands, ifs, or buts, but it's still just a personal injury action that's outside the scope of RICO.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> You started by talking to Justice Thomas about what it means to be injured in your business or property. Now there  might be a set of questions there that this Court has not addressed, lower courts have, but  you said lower courts have said that to -- to lose a job is to be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. Sorry. To lose a job can be both damages or an injury. It depends on the na ture of the cause of action. So you always generally, with every personal injury, can have permanent job loss. You can have lost wages. Those are damages.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's also --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It is a very rare case  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's also a loss when  --you know, it's a -- it's a harm when I lose a job. You know, I've been harmed. I lost my job. And --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> When you pay medical expenses, you're harmed as well.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> If you're harmed when you lose a job, then you've been injured in your business, haven't you?  I mean, just as -- I -- I guess what I'm saying is the simplest, clearest reading of this statutory language is it doesn't -- it doesn't distinguish by what causes the harm. It  just says, if you're harmed in a way that's in your business or property, which has been understood to include being harmed by loss of a  job, and that's by reason of a violation of Section 1962, then you're entitled to threefold the damages you would otherwise be  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the problem with that is it's reading the statute just like the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Antiterrorism Act, to say any person injured in his person can recover threefold the damages. And the --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's not reading the statute the same way as injured in his person because, if  -- if all I come in and say is, you know, I suffered emotional distress or I suffered pain and suffering, I would not be entitled to damage  -- to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So that's an infinitesimal, small number of cases that would be excluded.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> It might be an infinitesimal, small number of cases. I'm just trying to figure out -- like, that's the most normal, natural reading of the statutory language. If you've been -- it doesn't say what  you've been injured by. I mean, you have to be injured by the RICO violation. But it doesn't  distinguish among different kinds of RICO violations. It just says, if you've been injured by a RICO violation in your business --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> In your business, right.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- which includes your employment, then you're entitled to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the only way to give the statute its normal meaning of ""damages sustained"" is to distinguish between the injury. If the Respondent had hit a tree because he was impaired from THC, that would be a classic personal injury action for lost wages and medical expenses. It sounds like you think maybe the Second Circuit is right. The Second Circuit seemed to think lost wages are always recoverable, but medical expenses never would be because that results from a physical injury. And, of course, property loss, the most fundamental of all property loss is monetary loss.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But I  --I think what  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> All personal injury actions result in monetary loss except, I guess, a case where there's just exclusively psychological damage. But every slip and fall  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, I -- I don't know exactly how your rule works because, if you don't read it that normal, straightforward way, then, you know, you  -- you get into all these -- you admit in a whole set of hypos that I can do something to you that we would normally classify as a personal injury and you would be entitled to RICO damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So, if I hit you and, as a resul t of that -- this is your car wash operator example -- there's an assault that's usually understood as a personal injury, but, as a result, you decide to do business with the mobster rather than with a legitimate businessman and you say, well, notwithstanding that it was all caused by an assault, which was a personal injury, you are entitled to RICO damages. And I think you could say the same thing here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's just not our argument.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, you could have  --you could have a proximate -- well, I don't know how you get to the answers of your hypotheticals if that's not your argument.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. Whenever you have a robbery where money is taken or an extortion where money is taken or kidnapping where ransom is taken, there are two independent infringements of your legal right. You have a right to not be hit or assaulted or whatever, you know, kidnapped, and you have a right not to have your money taken. And when money is taken, you get your money back under RICO because that's a monetary independent loss. You cannot recover for physical --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, money is taken as a result of the assault. The assault happens, and then you say:  Okay, I better do business with you. So, I mean, you're  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's why our test  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's a -- it's a consequential injury from the assault.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me give you an example. If you take the money and then shove the person down the stairs, you took the money. You may have shoved the person down the stairs to prevent them from getting their money back, but our test doesn't ask which --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But that's not your own hypos. Your own hypos are things like there's an assault, there's a kidnapping, there's a murder. All of those things are personal injuries that don't have any particular economic component. As a result of those things, you lose some business opportunities, and -- and you yourself say you get RICO under that  -- you get RICO damages under those hypotheticals. So this one  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You can --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- looks pretty much like that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. You can always get RICO damages for independent property violations. And, here, there is just an allege  of a right not to have -- not to be induced to consume THC. Our position is no different than the Clayton Act. It's the exact same rule. This Court, in the Truett versus Chrysler Motor Company case, said:  No damages resulting from personal injuries. That is our test.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. Blatt, can I  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you where you get your definition of ""legal injury""?  I mean, are you looking at just kind of general tort principles?  I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out exactly how you look at it and define it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Two -- two -- two places. So, when it says, you know, this RJR Nabisco and also just the statute, you can sue and you can  sue for a personal injury, that, to me, conjures up the infringement of a right. And in WesternGeco, when the Court talked about an infringement of the patent right, it called it ""the injury.""  In Yegiazaryan, when it talked about what the injury in that case was when trying to decide if there's a domestic injury, it talked about what the racketeering activity directly did to the plaintiff. And so injury as an infringement of a legal right is a -- I think we cite Ballentine, but that is a standard definition of ""injury.""</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Where does the ""legal"" in the ""legal right"" come from?  Are you looking kind of at general principles?  You're just looking at the nature of the harm?  Does it help you in terms of property or --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, I think it's just a question of federal law. I mean, so whether you have an injury to person, property, or business, that's a question of federal law that's informed by general tort principles.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So are you looking at, like, the Restatement?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You could in the Burke case that dealt with whether something was a  personal injury on  -- sorry, damages on account of personal injury. The Court looked at things like a Dobbs and Restatements, but it was a federal question on whether the damages resulted from the personal injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Why  --why aren't you looking  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and whether there was a per  -- whether  --whether discrimination under Title VII was, in fact, a personal injury or some other kind of injury. The Court looked at a bunch of state law sources, but it was a federal law question.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, I  -- I'm trying to understand the personal injury that you say was alleged or happened in this case. I did not perceive Mr. Horn to be relying on any sort of personal injury allegation with respect to the RICO count. He doesn't say, for example, that he took the THC and that he got ill from it and, as a result of that, he took off from work and then he got fired. He says, instead, just directly, that he  --let me see --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I think  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- alleges a pattern of mail and wire fraud related to your client's alleged fraud about whether the product took -- contained THC. He relied on that, and he got fired as a result. I don't see where personal injury is doing any work in his RICO claim.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think you're correct in the complaint that the allegations we're talking about, where he's talking about physical harm, it's talking about either the -- the allegations that are general. But page 21 of our brief goes into great detail of all the other places in his affidavit and in the RICO case statement  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah, but those are in other counts. Those are in the personal injury counts. And I think that matters, right?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, not in the RICO statement. The RICO statement, by definition, is the RICO claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm saying is the question presented in this case, that you've presented, is whether economic harms resulting from personal injuries are  injuries to business and property. So I'm trying to understand the allegation of personal injury here from which  the business harm results.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah, and I guess --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He doesn't say:  My injury is resulting from a personal injury. He says:  I'm injured because I got fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, his entire causation -- and, again, I'm not just quoting from the complaint. His affidavit  -- he needs to rely on the consumption or he doesn't have causation. Consumption is personal injury. But this was litigated at the cert stage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But does your test need to rely on the consumption?  I mean, suppose there was  --suppose the employer's rule.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think that's fair, you're right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So  -- but -- but that's why I'm sort of, with Justice Kagan, trying to understand your rule. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think our rule is, if there's no personal injury, we don't need to be here and have this discussion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm asking you -- let me ask you in a hypothetical.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> All right?  So suppose we have the same basic situation, but the employer's rule is that you can't possess --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- THC. Can't have it. And he looks at all of the advertising materials. He understands that your product does not have it based on your advertising materials, and so he buys it and he has it in his locker. I think this is an example  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that the Respondents came up with.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- because the -- the  --the employer says:  You have it. You're not supposed to have it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Does he have a RICO claim or not under those circumstances?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he doesn't have a RICO claim, but it wouldn't be covered by this case because there's no personal injury. It would be no different if he was  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. You're inserting personal injury. What I'm suggesting --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Your example doesn't involve a personal injury. Now, at most -- if I can just answer the direct question. If I was that person's lawyer, I would say:  You were injured in your business or property for the purchase price. You paid  --purchase price is a classic RICO injury, classic Clayton Act. He's entitled to three times his purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So you're saying he would have a RICO claim in --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He would  -- okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But lost wages aren't -- he doesn't rely on the law  -- he --and he would fail any kind of causation test if he tried to say:  I was f ired from the purchase price. He would ultimately fail causation under three of your Supreme Court cases that say there has to be a direct relationship between the conduc t that was done to the plaintiff and the lost claim. And there, you had the independent actor of the employer. It would be no different if the employer fired him for bei ng tricked into buying baby powder that, you know, didn't have the requisite -- it might -- he might have an injury, but he just wouldn't have a RICO claim because there would be lack of causation.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and isn't that essentially what's wrong with this case too, is what Justice Sotomayor was suggesting?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It does --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, there is a definite causation problem in this case.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> His -- his -- you know, he buys this thing. He ingests this  thing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And someone else fired him.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> A different person fires him. This is not a good RICO claim for that reason, but it has nothing to do with the reason that you're  giving.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, no, no, no, no. You can win for more than one reason, Justice Kagan. The Second Circuit held that a --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you're relying on an intuition that your client should win and Ms. Anand should lose. And that intuition may be a very valid one and  -- but the -- but the intuition works because there's no  proximate cause.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But all -- with all --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> The intuition does not work because he hasn't satisfied the business or property requirement because he has. He's been injured in his person or property --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, and with all due respect  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- by reason of a RICO violation.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- with all due respect, every classic slip-and-fall personal injury case, you could talk about causation clearly,  but it would still be the lost wages, you're fired because you either can't work because you're permanently disabled, or your employer fires you because you can no longer see or have an arm.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, maybe there's  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You still lose your job, but it's  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- maybe there's also an issue  --I mean, we haven't -- we haven't decided what this ""business or property"" phrase means. Maybe ""business or property""  doesn't mean lost wages. But, again, it -- that's a -- that's a second reason why you might win but also a reason that has nothing to do with the reason that you're articulating here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Just  -- Justice Kagan, the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit hold, if  you have a personal injury, and what the other side reads the statute to say anybody injured in his person, have at it under RICO; just don't assert economic damages. That flips the statute on its head. It doesn't say anything about being injured in your person. And, under their rule, all personal injuries are recoverable under RICO, which is an absurd not just intuitive proposition, but that cannot be within the contemplation --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Can I pick up --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of Congress.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- on Justice Barrett's question?  Because I think the other side says that injury, just ordinary meaning, means harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And you say that's wrong based on an idea that ""injury"" is a term of art, I think --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- in tort law. Can you elaborate on why injury does not equal harm?  Because that's --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- front and center in their brief.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- so I think injury could mean harm just as it means the -- the legal harm that was invaded. So I don't have a problem with the word ""harm.""  But what it doesn't mean  is loss in terms of any damage. And they have no meaning or independent distinction between ""injury"" and ""damages sustained.""  And I think inherent in that distinction between the injury that -- the injury that you sue over is the type of infringement. And you have to have  -- look, everyone agrees at least I think since you've said it twice under Clayton Act and RICO that the cause of action excludes personal injuries. So what does that mean?  We think it means what it says. It excludes personal injuries. So that means the damages from personal injuries. They say no, no, no, it includes personal injuries and it includes all damages from personal injuries.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why is this a damage from personal injury?  That's the part I don't understand. He's not claiming that he got  ill because of the product. He's not saying he was personally injured. He didn't even know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that he had ingested THC until the testing and the firing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Isn't that where his injury comes in?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think -- I mean, this was the  --this was what  the other side briefed to the Second Circuit and the Second Circuit didn't decide it. But, if I ate poppyseed bagels and failed a drug test, it's a personal injury. If I took a medicine like doxycycline, which is an antibiotic, and I can't be out in the sun and I lose my job as a lifeguard, it's a personal injury claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why are you saying that?  You can -- I mean, you're just saying that. I'm asking you, you know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Why am I saying it?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- there are -- there are personal injury claims that derive  from a person being harmed by -- by the ingestion of the product, right?  They're bodily, physically harmed because they have taken this thing. I don't read this claim to be that kind of injury. He's not saying that the  product itself injured him in any way.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think it is inconsistent with all of tort law to say a bodily invasion is not a personal injury just because you didn't have to go to the hospital or cough.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He voluntarily took the product.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, we all do.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He was not invaded. He  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> We all take products that can be mislabeled. We take them and we either get sick or we don't. But we all take products and we claim, yeah, but the label told me I wasn't going to have a side effect  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and I had the side effect.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- Ms. Blatt, if I might ask you a different question. You rely  heavily on the Clayton Act and -- and the similar language there. I went and looked at the Areeda -Hovenkamp, what they have to say about this.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, dear.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I know. I know. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah. ""Oh, dear"" is right. They say:  Reiter thus made plain that the business-or-property requirement is virtually always satisfied provided there's some kind  of injury that can properly be characterized as economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Well, I don't -- I mean, that's not right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I would go -- no.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- you just disagree with Areeda  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, yeah. No, that's definitely wro ng.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. Okay. Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely. And  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That' s all I need to know. Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. No. Wrong, wrong, wrong. And Reiter, I think, I mean, says  anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss it's going to be a business or injury. But let's  -- look, there are Clayton Act cases after Clayton  -- any -- any conspiracy to affect drug prices that result in a personal injury would mean treble damages under Clayton Act. That would be a sea change -- a sea change in Clayton Act if you had personal injury recovery for price-fixing.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So even Homer nods, the great Areeda and Hovenkamp treatise wrong?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely, because you would -- you would -- that would be, like I said, a sea change under Clayton Act. I mean, it might be a boondoggle for plaintiffs' lawyers, but I think it would freak everyone else out.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, aren't you estopped from claiming that he has a personal injury here when below you argued or  your client argued that he had no personal injury, which is why all the personal injury claims were dismissed?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I don't understand how you can have it both ways.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. On page 113 of the Pet. App., the district court is recognizing that we argued, and the court said, there's no cognizable injury. But, on pages 49 and 50, which I think is pretty bad for the other side, the court is saying but there's clearly a -- this is a classic personal injury claim, which is why he can get lost wages for fraud.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. I'm talking about what you argued. Your client argued, to get rid of the personal injury claims, that he had no personal injury; the only thing was economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So -- so --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And so now that he's left with the economic, you say no, there is a personal injury and he can't get damages for that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Sorry. On pages 49 and 50, it goes through how we, the defendants, are arguing th is is a personal injury claim. So we did argue it was a personal injury claim. We  claimed what we're talking about before, there's no cognizable personal injury. It's like saying  emotional damage, it's not -- it doesn't count because you didn't have  --it didn't manifest itself in physical. So I don't think we're estopped. If you want to let that, I guess, I don't know, reverse, you'd have to reverse the rule and then decide if we're estopped, but I don't -- I'm not sure how that would work out if that's what you thought.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Do you want to respond to their invocation of the liberal construction canon?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes, a couple responses. I mean, liberal construction in light of its remedial purposes, but the one thing all nine of you should agree on, its remedial purposes did not extend to personal injuries. You've already said that twice, in the Clayton Act and in RJR Nabisco. It doesn't extend to remediate personal injury. Second of all, I think it's a tie-breaker. Their  -- their serious reading of the statute inserts the word ""injured in its person"" to read just like the Antiterrorism Act. And, finally, I think it does run up against the constitutional principle of federalism, that their view does cannibalize all of state tort law. Every -- every slip and fall from a mislabel now is a RICO case. So I think, I mean, that should be  -- the Court -- I mean, one more thing I'll try on that, the Court last cited that clause in 1985. I mean, it hasn't relied on it since and says you shouldn't use it to put RICO in contexts that Congress, you know, didn't want or couldn't have contemplated. And, here, it is just so  -- would be so striking to think that RICO remedied personal injuries.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say that under RICO, injury is ""the invasion of a legal right.""  So how would we go about determining  whether something is a legal right for this purpose?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, first, you look at the complaint. I think property's pretty easy because the Court has already said any monetary  loss is a property loss. So, I mean, you could quibble about whether loss of consortium, if state law defines that as a property loss. And then injury is also, I think, pretty easy  because that involves the body.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, what authorities would we look at?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh. Look at the complaint. Look at state law general tort principles. Again, that Burke case  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> General tort principles?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. What Burke said is -- which I like because it -- I think it works -- is that are the damages -- what are the damages seeking to redress?  Are the damages redressing a  --something that happened to the body, are they redressing stolen property, or  are they redressing a right to carry on in your business?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you rely a lot on WesternGeco. You mentioned it a  few minutes ago.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you ignore its language where they differentiate a patent case where the legal right is the right not to be infringed and where you feel the economic loss is different. And we said there that the Patent Act was different from civil RICO because the question in civil RICO is where the plaintiff feels the injury, in other words, where he suffers the economic harm that the damages compensate. So why should we think -- in -- in Sedima, we were very, very clear that RICO doesn't rely on state law -- state tort law concepts. We said that explicitly. What we  said was that RICO complicates injuries to have been caused by predicate acts. That's our --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and we explicitly -- explicitly say:  Not otherwise an  injury cognizable under state tort law.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's even better for me because our position is you shouldn't -- you can't get recovery that's -- that's caused by personal injury, which I think this case is. But, on RJR Nabisco -- sorry, the WesternGeco citing RJR Nabisco, I didn't --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that goes back to what Justice Jackson and  -- and what I tried earlier and Justice Kagan point out:  You're trying to say there's a difference between the two. But we've made very clear in WesternGeco there isn't. Injury is where you feel the harm. Now the question is:  What's the harm?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yegiazaryan said the opposite. Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as Justice Jackson said, the harm is not ingesting the drugs. That's the personal injury. The harm is from being fired. And whether there's a connection between the predicate acts and that harm  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- is a question of proximate cause, not a question of personal injury.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan is the most recent case where you said the injury was -- the inability to collect the California judgment was a domestic injury. You did not say it was the injury where all the effects were felt, which were a million different places  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that has nothing to do with the language of RICO -- of RICO, which says --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It was the language of</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- compensable injuries are the harms caused by predicate acts. And that's what we said in WesternGeco.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It's where you feel the harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan quotes that exact same language, and I think it's talk -- it begs the question about what is the harm talking about. Is it the harm that's the legal invasion of the right, or is it the damages at the end of the day?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask you about a hypo?  Because I'm still trying to understand your rule. You seem to be suggesting that the mere existence of physical harm renders any business injury not compensable. Is that  -- is that the  --do I have the sum total of your --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No?  Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because you just said --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So what is your rule?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --you just -- because you just said it's any personal injury renders the -- 40 damages  not recoverable. Obviously, if you have a business injury, a property injury, you can recover damages.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even if you have a physical injury too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely, because that's the example of a robbery. If you are thrown down a flight of stairs and they take your wallet, you have two injuries. You fell down the stairs and you lost your wallet.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You've got -- so you have a property injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- and a personal injury</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --two independent invasions.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and so, here, you say he took the drugs and that was an injury. And he says:  I was also fired. Why isn't that  two injuries too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because every  -- you would -- because -- because that conflates damages. Every personal injury, you could say I slip and fell --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But this is -- imagine that this is not damages in the following sense, all right?  If we have a case  in which he takes the drugs --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and, as a result of taking the drugs, he has to go to  the hospital, and, as a result of being in the hospital, he can't work.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I kind of understand the argument you're making. But, in this situation, he takes the drugs and there is no harm --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to him from taking the drugs.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me leave you with one more example. He goes to the hospital and he loses his sight and he can't drive anymore, so he gets fired. He still has a loss of employment. It is a damage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. But that's not this case. Nothing happened to him as a result of taking the drugs. Instead, what happened to him, I think -- and this is -- maybe I'm just not understanding.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he failed a drug test. It changed his -- well, allegedly, it had THC in it. I think it's the same thing as if you took something and had an allergic reaction. It's a physical, chemical, bodily invasion. He didn't want  -- he didn't want THC and he took it. It's like taking cocaine. That's a  -- to me, that's a physical injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- whether or not you hid something.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anand.</text>",coherent
2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson, Does he have a RICO claim or not under those circumstances?,"<speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Thank you, and may it please the Court:  RICO states that any person injured in his business or property by reason of racketeering can sue therefor and recover threefold the damages he sustains. Because RICO's cause of action excludes personal injuries, RICO excludes damages resulting from personal injuries. The text differentiates the injury from racketeering and the damages sustained from that injury, thus showing that injury and damages are distinct. And the references to damages he sustains shows that damages are the losses suffere d as a result of the injury. Damages are not themselves the injury inflicted by the defendant. This distinction tracks this Court's recognition that lost wages and medical expenses are classic damages from personal injuries. Respondent's complaint alleges  the personal injury of unwanted ingestion of THC and the resulting damages of lost wages. To quote the complaint:  ""Defendant's behavior caused  Plaintiff's fiscal harm in the ingestion of Dixie, and as a direct result of consuming this  product, he was dismissed from his employment."" That's a personal injury claim outside civil RICO. Respondent argues that every economic loss is its own RICO injury but not to worry because RICO still bars non-pecuniary damages. But that view conflates injury and damages by treating RICO's exclusion of personal injuries as just excluding a narrow type of damages: pain and suffering and emotional distress. Respondent's rule also leaves the personal exclusion toothless since virtually all personal injuries result in monetary loss. It is utterly implausible that Congress federalized every slip and fall involving RICO predicates. Personal injuries are serious and may support state tort -- tort claims, but they are not the stuff of RICO. I welcome questions.</text>","<speaker>John G.

I welcome questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> What does it mean to be injured, someone to be injured, in his business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> The Court  in -- in the Clayton Act case of Reiter talked about what -- injury to business, and it was referring to anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss, it would be both a right  -- a -- a injury to both business and property, a right to carry on business. Now the lower courts pre-RICO under the Clayton Act have also recognized that an employee has a business kind of a right to carry on in his employment, and we haven't contested that. So, in those cases, if you conspired to prevent  -- in those cases, they involved encyclopedic salesmen, deprived those people of their right to carry on their profession as a salesman, the -- the lower courts recognized that that was an injury to business. So it's a right to carry on, you know, a profession or your commercial enterprise.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Can loss of employment ever constitute a injury in business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, it's -- it certainly does in the Clayton Act. And the example I could think of, the only example that r eadily comes to mind, in RICO would be the human trafficking cases, where a person is forced to work against their will, and the -- there's an injury in your right to get, you know, the -- the payment for your performed work. So that would be an injury, a direct injury, to one's business. And that human trafficking  --it's hard to see how it would otherwis e come up unless you defrauded someone into quitting their job, but, generally, lost wages are pretty standard, prototypical damages from personal injury.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you're raising an example that leads me to think that what you're really arguing about is proximate cause, meaning -- and not really whether personal injury is recoverable or not. It is under, by your own admission, certain circumstances. And, in your brief, you list a bunch of examples that seem to me quintessential personal injuries, but you related them to the business loss and then said those were recoverable.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So personal --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So it doesn't make any sense to me to say a mob can threaten a store owner to take over his business and, if he doesn't, injure him and he can't recover, but if they put a bomb in the place and close it down, they close it down by hitting him or shooting him but then throw a bomb, he can recover for the bomb but not for the injury to himself.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So no one in  -- under this statute can ever recover for personal injuries, full stop, never ever. If there's an independent infringement  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But why?  Isn't --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of the right to property  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- isn't that an issue or shouldn't it be an issue of proximate cause, which wasn't reached in this case, correct?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, no, and here's why, because a lot of examples, the plaintiff will meet a direct and proximate cause, and I can start to give you a million, but they would  still be damages resulting from personal injury. Take your  -- a shooting where someone is shot and suffers medical expenses and can't work. Direct injury, sure, the lost wages and  medical expenses, but, still, it's damages resulting from personal injury, so a proximate cause --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But, no, there's a whole lot more to RICO than simply damages. There's also the predicate that you have to have a racketeering --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For sure.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- enterprise. You have to have willful intent. In product liability cases, most of those are negligence or strict liability, so you're not going to have willfulness or intent. And, similarly, you have to show proximate causation, reasonably foreseeable. There's a serious question as to whether you shoot someone not related to the enterprise and you cause damage, but another predicate act occurs that you're going to recover. --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, in your normal case of any personal injury, you read a -- misread --a label's confuse -- misleading, you're injured, you are  -- can't work, you have lost -- lost --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You're still not</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> That's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- you're still not answering my --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I guess what  -- so two things. You can always have causation, but there's still an independent requirement that you must be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> There has to be proximate causation  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes. And there's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- which is very different.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --plenty of proximate, direct, absolute causation, no ands, ifs, or buts, but it's still just a personal injury action that's outside the scope of RICO.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> You started by talking to Justice Thomas about what it means to be injured in your business or property. Now there  might be a set of questions there that this Court has not addressed, lower courts have, but  you said lower courts have said that to -- to lose a job is to be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. Sorry. To lose a job can be both damages or an injury. It depends on the na ture of the cause of action. So you always generally, with every personal injury, can have permanent job loss. You can have lost wages. Those are damages.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's also --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It is a very rare case  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's also a loss when  --you know, it's a -- it's a harm when I lose a job. You know, I've been harmed. I lost my job. And --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> When you pay medical expenses, you're harmed as well.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> If you're harmed when you lose a job, then you've been injured in your business, haven't you?  I mean, just as -- I -- I guess what I'm saying is the simplest, clearest reading of this statutory language is it doesn't -- it doesn't distinguish by what causes the harm. It  just says, if you're harmed in a way that's in your business or property, which has been understood to include being harmed by loss of a  job, and that's by reason of a violation of Section 1962, then you're entitled to threefold the damages you would otherwise be  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the problem with that is it's reading the statute just like the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Antiterrorism Act, to say any person injured in his person can recover threefold the damages. And the --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's not reading the statute the same way as injured in his person because, if  -- if all I come in and say is, you know, I suffered emotional distress or I suffered pain and suffering, I would not be entitled to damage  -- to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So that's an infinitesimal, small number of cases that would be excluded.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> It might be an infinitesimal, small number of cases. I'm just trying to figure out -- like, that's the most normal, natural reading of the statutory language. If you've been -- it doesn't say what  you've been injured by. I mean, you have to be injured by the RICO violation. But it doesn't  distinguish among different kinds of RICO violations. It just says, if you've been injured by a RICO violation in your business --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> In your business, right.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- which includes your employment, then you're entitled to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the only way to give the statute its normal meaning of ""damages sustained"" is to distinguish between the injury. If the Respondent had hit a tree because he was impaired from THC, that would be a classic personal injury action for lost wages and medical expenses. It sounds like you think maybe the Second Circuit is right. The Second Circuit seemed to think lost wages are always recoverable, but medical expenses never would be because that results from a physical injury. And, of course, property loss, the most fundamental of all property loss is monetary loss.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But I  --I think what  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> All personal injury actions result in monetary loss except, I guess, a case where there's just exclusively psychological damage. But every slip and fall  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, I -- I don't know exactly how your rule works because, if you don't read it that normal, straightforward way, then, you know, you  -- you get into all these -- you admit in a whole set of hypos that I can do something to you that we would normally classify as a personal injury and you would be entitled to RICO damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So, if I hit you and, as a resul t of that -- this is your car wash operator example -- there's an assault that's usually understood as a personal injury, but, as a result, you decide to do business with the mobster rather than with a legitimate businessman and you say, well, notwithstanding that it was all caused by an assault, which was a personal injury, you are entitled to RICO damages. And I think you could say the same thing here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's just not our argument.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, you could have  --you could have a proximate -- well, I don't know how you get to the answers of your hypotheticals if that's not your argument.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. Whenever you have a robbery where money is taken or an extortion where money is taken or kidnapping where ransom is taken, there are two independent infringements of your legal right. You have a right to not be hit or assaulted or whatever, you know, kidnapped, and you have a right not to have your money taken. And when money is taken, you get your money back under RICO because that's a monetary independent loss. You cannot recover for physical --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, money is taken as a result of the assault. The assault happens, and then you say:  Okay, I better do business with you. So, I mean, you're  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's why our test  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's a -- it's a consequential injury from the assault.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me give you an example. If you take the money and then shove the person down the stairs, you took the money. You may have shoved the person down the stairs to prevent them from getting their money back, but our test doesn't ask which --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But that's not your own hypos. Your own hypos are things like there's an assault, there's a kidnapping, there's a murder. All of those things are personal injuries that don't have any particular economic component. As a result of those things, you lose some business opportunities, and -- and you yourself say you get RICO under that  -- you get RICO damages under those hypotheticals. So this one  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You can --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- looks pretty much like that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. You can always get RICO damages for independent property violations. And, here, there is just an allege  of a right not to have -- not to be induced to consume THC. Our position is no different than the Clayton Act. It's the exact same rule. This Court, in the Truett versus Chrysler Motor Company case, said:  No damages resulting from personal injuries. That is our test.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. Blatt, can I  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you where you get your definition of ""legal injury""?  I mean, are you looking at just kind of general tort principles?  I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out exactly how you look at it and define it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Two -- two -- two places. So, when it says, you know, this RJR Nabisco and also just the statute, you can sue and you can  sue for a personal injury, that, to me, conjures up the infringement of a right. And in WesternGeco, when the Court talked about an infringement of the patent right, it called it ""the injury.""  In Yegiazaryan, when it talked about what the injury in that case was when trying to decide if there's a domestic injury, it talked about what the racketeering activity directly did to the plaintiff. And so injury as an infringement of a legal right is a -- I think we cite Ballentine, but that is a standard definition of ""injury.""</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Where does the ""legal"" in the ""legal right"" come from?  Are you looking kind of at general principles?  You're just looking at the nature of the harm?  Does it help you in terms of property or --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, I think it's just a question of federal law. I mean, so whether you have an injury to person, property, or business, that's a question of federal law that's informed by general tort principles.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So are you looking at, like, the Restatement?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You could in the Burke case that dealt with whether something was a  personal injury on  -- sorry, damages on account of personal injury. The Court looked at things like a Dobbs and Restatements, but it was a federal question on whether the damages resulted from the personal injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Why  --why aren't you looking  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and whether there was a per  -- whether  --whether discrimination under Title VII was, in fact, a personal injury or some other kind of injury. The Court looked at a bunch of state law sources, but it was a federal law question.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, I  -- I'm trying to understand the personal injury that you say was alleged or happened in this case. I did not perceive Mr. Horn to be relying on any sort of personal injury allegation with respect to the RICO count. He doesn't say, for example, that he took the THC and that he got ill from it and, as a result of that, he took off from work and then he got fired. He says, instead, just directly, that he  --let me see --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I think  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- alleges a pattern of mail and wire fraud related to your client's alleged fraud about whether the product took -- contained THC. He relied on that, and he got fired as a result. I don't see where personal injury is doing any work in his RICO claim.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think you're correct in the complaint that the allegations we're talking about, where he's talking about physical harm, it's talking about either the -- the allegations that are general. But page 21 of our brief goes into great detail of all the other places in his affidavit and in the RICO case statement  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah, but those are in other counts. Those are in the personal injury counts. And I think that matters, right?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, not in the RICO statement. The RICO statement, by definition, is the RICO claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm saying is the question presented in this case, that you've presented, is whether economic harms resulting from personal injuries are  injuries to business and property. So I'm trying to understand the allegation of personal injury here from which  the business harm results.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah, and I guess --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He doesn't say:  My injury is resulting from a personal injury. He says:  I'm injured because I got fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, his entire causation -- and, again, I'm not just quoting from the complaint. His affidavit  -- he needs to rely on the consumption or he doesn't have causation. Consumption is personal injury. But this was litigated at the cert stage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But does your test need to rely on the consumption?  I mean, suppose there was  --suppose the employer's rule.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think that's fair, you're right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So  -- but -- but that's why I'm sort of, with Justice Kagan, trying to understand your rule. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think our rule is, if there's no personal injury, we don't need to be here and have this discussion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm asking you -- let me ask you in a hypothetical.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> All right?  So suppose we have the same basic situation, but the employer's rule is that you can't possess --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- THC. Can't have it. And he looks at all of the advertising materials. He understands that your product does not have it based on your advertising materials, and so he buys it and he has it in his locker. I think this is an example  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that the Respondents came up with.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- because the -- the  --the employer says:  You have it. You're not supposed to have it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Does he have a RICO claim or not under those circumstances?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he doesn't have a RICO claim, but it wouldn't be covered by this case because there's no personal injury. It would be no different if he was  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. You're inserting personal injury. What I'm suggesting --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Your example doesn't involve a personal injury. Now, at most -- if I can just answer the direct question. If I was that person's lawyer, I would say:  You were injured in your business or property for the purchase price. You paid  --purchase price is a classic RICO injury, classic Clayton Act. He's entitled to three times his purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So you're saying he would have a RICO claim in --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He would  -- okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But lost wages aren't -- he doesn't rely on the law  -- he --and he would fail any kind of causation test if he tried to say:  I was f ired from the purchase price. He would ultimately fail causation under three of your Supreme Court cases that say there has to be a direct relationship between the conduc t that was done to the plaintiff and the lost claim. And there, you had the independent actor of the employer. It would be no different if the employer fired him for bei ng tricked into buying baby powder that, you know, didn't have the requisite -- it might -- he might have an injury, but he just wouldn't have a RICO claim because there would be lack of causation.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and isn't that essentially what's wrong with this case too, is what Justice Sotomayor was suggesting?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It does --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, there is a definite causation problem in this case.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> His -- his -- you know, he buys this thing. He ingests this  thing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And someone else fired him.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> A different person fires him. This is not a good RICO claim for that reason, but it has nothing to do with the reason that you're  giving.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, no, no, no, no. You can win for more than one reason, Justice Kagan. The Second Circuit held that a --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you're relying on an intuition that your client should win and Ms. Anand should lose. And that intuition may be a very valid one and  -- but the -- but the intuition works because there's no  proximate cause.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But all -- with all --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> The intuition does not work because he hasn't satisfied the business or property requirement because he has. He's been injured in his person or property --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, and with all due respect  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- by reason of a RICO violation.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- with all due respect, every classic slip-and-fall personal injury case, you could talk about causation clearly,  but it would still be the lost wages, you're fired because you either can't work because you're permanently disabled, or your employer fires you because you can no longer see or have an arm.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, maybe there's  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You still lose your job, but it's  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- maybe there's also an issue  --I mean, we haven't -- we haven't decided what this ""business or property"" phrase means. Maybe ""business or property""  doesn't mean lost wages. But, again, it -- that's a -- that's a second reason why you might win but also a reason that has nothing to do with the reason that you're articulating here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Just  -- Justice Kagan, the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit hold, if  you have a personal injury, and what the other side reads the statute to say anybody injured in his person, have at it under RICO; just don't assert economic damages. That flips the statute on its head. It doesn't say anything about being injured in your person. And, under their rule, all personal injuries are recoverable under RICO, which is an absurd not just intuitive proposition, but that cannot be within the contemplation --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Can I pick up --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of Congress.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- on Justice Barrett's question?  Because I think the other side says that injury, just ordinary meaning, means harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And you say that's wrong based on an idea that ""injury"" is a term of art, I think --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- in tort law. Can you elaborate on why injury does not equal harm?  Because that's --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- front and center in their brief.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- so I think injury could mean harm just as it means the -- the legal harm that was invaded. So I don't have a problem with the word ""harm.""  But what it doesn't mean  is loss in terms of any damage. And they have no meaning or independent distinction between ""injury"" and ""damages sustained.""  And I think inherent in that distinction between the injury that -- the injury that you sue over is the type of infringement. And you have to have  -- look, everyone agrees at least I think since you've said it twice under Clayton Act and RICO that the cause of action excludes personal injuries. So what does that mean?  We think it means what it says. It excludes personal injuries. So that means the damages from personal injuries. They say no, no, no, it includes personal injuries and it includes all damages from personal injuries.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why is this a damage from personal injury?  That's the part I don't understand. He's not claiming that he got  ill because of the product. He's not saying he was personally injured. He didn't even know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that he had ingested THC until the testing and the firing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Isn't that where his injury comes in?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think -- I mean, this was the  --this was what  the other side briefed to the Second Circuit and the Second Circuit didn't decide it. But, if I ate poppyseed bagels and failed a drug test, it's a personal injury. If I took a medicine like doxycycline, which is an antibiotic, and I can't be out in the sun and I lose my job as a lifeguard, it's a personal injury claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why are you saying that?  You can -- I mean, you're just saying that. I'm asking you, you know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Why am I saying it?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- there are -- there are personal injury claims that derive  from a person being harmed by -- by the ingestion of the product, right?  They're bodily, physically harmed because they have taken this thing. I don't read this claim to be that kind of injury. He's not saying that the  product itself injured him in any way.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think it is inconsistent with all of tort law to say a bodily invasion is not a personal injury just because you didn't have to go to the hospital or cough.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He voluntarily took the product.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, we all do.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He was not invaded. He  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> We all take products that can be mislabeled. We take them and we either get sick or we don't. But we all take products and we claim, yeah, but the label told me I wasn't going to have a side effect  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and I had the side effect.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- Ms. Blatt, if I might ask you a different question. You rely  heavily on the Clayton Act and -- and the similar language there. I went and looked at the Areeda -Hovenkamp, what they have to say about this.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, dear.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I know. I know. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah. ""Oh, dear"" is right. They say:  Reiter thus made plain that the business-or-property requirement is virtually always satisfied provided there's some kind  of injury that can properly be characterized as economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Well, I don't -- I mean, that's not right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I would go -- no.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- you just disagree with Areeda  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, yeah. No, that's definitely wro ng.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. Okay. Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely. And  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That' s all I need to know. Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. No. Wrong, wrong, wrong. And Reiter, I think, I mean, says  anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss it's going to be a business or injury. But let's  -- look, there are Clayton Act cases after Clayton  -- any -- any conspiracy to affect drug prices that result in a personal injury would mean treble damages under Clayton Act. That would be a sea change -- a sea change in Clayton Act if you had personal injury recovery for price-fixing.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So even Homer nods, the great Areeda and Hovenkamp treatise wrong?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely, because you would -- you would -- that would be, like I said, a sea change under Clayton Act. I mean, it might be a boondoggle for plaintiffs' lawyers, but I think it would freak everyone else out.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, aren't you estopped from claiming that he has a personal injury here when below you argued or  your client argued that he had no personal injury, which is why all the personal injury claims were dismissed?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I don't understand how you can have it both ways.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. On page 113 of the Pet. App., the district court is recognizing that we argued, and the court said, there's no cognizable injury. But, on pages 49 and 50, which I think is pretty bad for the other side, the court is saying but there's clearly a -- this is a classic personal injury claim, which is why he can get lost wages for fraud.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. I'm talking about what you argued. Your client argued, to get rid of the personal injury claims, that he had no personal injury; the only thing was economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So -- so --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And so now that he's left with the economic, you say no, there is a personal injury and he can't get damages for that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Sorry. On pages 49 and 50, it goes through how we, the defendants, are arguing th is is a personal injury claim. So we did argue it was a personal injury claim. We  claimed what we're talking about before, there's no cognizable personal injury. It's like saying  emotional damage, it's not -- it doesn't count because you didn't have  --it didn't manifest itself in physical. So I don't think we're estopped. If you want to let that, I guess, I don't know, reverse, you'd have to reverse the rule and then decide if we're estopped, but I don't -- I'm not sure how that would work out if that's what you thought.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Do you want to respond to their invocation of the liberal construction canon?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes, a couple responses. I mean, liberal construction in light of its remedial purposes, but the one thing all nine of you should agree on, its remedial purposes did not extend to personal injuries. You've already said that twice, in the Clayton Act and in RJR Nabisco. It doesn't extend to remediate personal injury. Second of all, I think it's a tie-breaker. Their  -- their serious reading of the statute inserts the word ""injured in its person"" to read just like the Antiterrorism Act. And, finally, I think it does run up against the constitutional principle of federalism, that their view does cannibalize all of state tort law. Every -- every slip and fall from a mislabel now is a RICO case. So I think, I mean, that should be  -- the Court -- I mean, one more thing I'll try on that, the Court last cited that clause in 1985. I mean, it hasn't relied on it since and says you shouldn't use it to put RICO in contexts that Congress, you know, didn't want or couldn't have contemplated. And, here, it is just so  -- would be so striking to think that RICO remedied personal injuries.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say that under RICO, injury is ""the invasion of a legal right.""  So how would we go about determining  whether something is a legal right for this purpose?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, first, you look at the complaint. I think property's pretty easy because the Court has already said any monetary  loss is a property loss. So, I mean, you could quibble about whether loss of consortium, if state law defines that as a property loss. And then injury is also, I think, pretty easy  because that involves the body.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, what authorities would we look at?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh. Look at the complaint. Look at state law general tort principles. Again, that Burke case  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> General tort principles?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. What Burke said is -- which I like because it -- I think it works -- is that are the damages -- what are the damages seeking to redress?  Are the damages redressing a  --something that happened to the body, are they redressing stolen property, or  are they redressing a right to carry on in your business?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you rely a lot on WesternGeco. You mentioned it a  few minutes ago.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you ignore its language where they differentiate a patent case where the legal right is the right not to be infringed and where you feel the economic loss is different. And we said there that the Patent Act was different from civil RICO because the question in civil RICO is where the plaintiff feels the injury, in other words, where he suffers the economic harm that the damages compensate. So why should we think -- in -- in Sedima, we were very, very clear that RICO doesn't rely on state law -- state tort law concepts. We said that explicitly. What we  said was that RICO complicates injuries to have been caused by predicate acts. That's our --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and we explicitly -- explicitly say:  Not otherwise an  injury cognizable under state tort law.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's even better for me because our position is you shouldn't -- you can't get recovery that's -- that's caused by personal injury, which I think this case is. But, on RJR Nabisco -- sorry, the WesternGeco citing RJR Nabisco, I didn't --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that goes back to what Justice Jackson and  -- and what I tried earlier and Justice Kagan point out:  You're trying to say there's a difference between the two. But we've made very clear in WesternGeco there isn't. Injury is where you feel the harm. Now the question is:  What's the harm?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yegiazaryan said the opposite. Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as Justice Jackson said, the harm is not ingesting the drugs. That's the personal injury. The harm is from being fired. And whether there's a connection between the predicate acts and that harm  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- is a question of proximate cause, not a question of personal injury.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan is the most recent case where you said the injury was -- the inability to collect the California judgment was a domestic injury. You did not say it was the injury where all the effects were felt, which were a million different places  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that has nothing to do with the language of RICO -- of RICO, which says --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It was the language of</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- compensable injuries are the harms caused by predicate acts. And that's what we said in WesternGeco.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It's where you feel the harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan quotes that exact same language, and I think it's talk -- it begs the question about what is the harm talking about. Is it the harm that's the legal invasion of the right, or is it the damages at the end of the day?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask you about a hypo?  Because I'm still trying to understand your rule. You seem to be suggesting that the mere existence of physical harm renders any business injury not compensable. Is that  -- is that the  --do I have the sum total of your --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No?  Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because you just said --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So what is your rule?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --you just -- because you just said it's any personal injury renders the -- 40 damages  not recoverable. Obviously, if you have a business injury, a property injury, you can recover damages.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even if you have a physical injury too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely, because that's the example of a robbery. If you are thrown down a flight of stairs and they take your wallet, you have two injuries. You fell down the stairs and you lost your wallet.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You've got -- so you have a property injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- and a personal injury</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --two independent invasions.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and so, here, you say he took the drugs and that was an injury. And he says:  I was also fired. Why isn't that  two injuries too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because every  -- you would -- because -- because that conflates damages. Every personal injury, you could say I slip and fell --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But this is -- imagine that this is not damages in the following sense, all right?  If we have a case  in which he takes the drugs --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and, as a result of taking the drugs, he has to go to  the hospital, and, as a result of being in the hospital, he can't work.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I kind of understand the argument you're making. But, in this situation, he takes the drugs and there is no harm --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to him from taking the drugs.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me leave you with one more example. He goes to the hospital and he loses his sight and he can't drive anymore, so he gets fired. He still has a loss of employment. It is a damage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. But that's not this case. Nothing happened to him as a result of taking the drugs. Instead, what happened to him, I think -- and this is -- maybe I'm just not understanding.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he failed a drug test. It changed his -- well, allegedly, it had THC in it. I think it's the same thing as if you took something and had an allergic reaction. It's a physical, chemical, bodily invasion. He didn't want  -- he didn't want THC and he took it. It's like taking cocaine. That's a  -- to me, that's a physical injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S.

2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," -- on Justice Barrett's question?  Because I think the other side says that injury, just ordinary meaning, means harm.","<speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Thank you, and may it please the Court:  RICO states that any person injured in his business or property by reason of racketeering can sue therefor and recover threefold the damages he sustains. Because RICO's cause of action excludes personal injuries, RICO excludes damages resulting from personal injuries. The text differentiates the injury from racketeering and the damages sustained from that injury, thus showing that injury and damages are distinct. And the references to damages he sustains shows that damages are the losses suffere d as a result of the injury. Damages are not themselves the injury inflicted by the defendant. This distinction tracks this Court's recognition that lost wages and medical expenses are classic damages from personal injuries. Respondent's complaint alleges  the personal injury of unwanted ingestion of THC and the resulting damages of lost wages. To quote the complaint:  ""Defendant's behavior caused  Plaintiff's fiscal harm in the ingestion of Dixie, and as a direct result of consuming this  product, he was dismissed from his employment."" That's a personal injury claim outside civil RICO. Respondent argues that every economic loss is its own RICO injury but not to worry because RICO still bars non-pecuniary damages. But that view conflates injury and damages by treating RICO's exclusion of personal injuries as just excluding a narrow type of damages: pain and suffering and emotional distress. Respondent's rule also leaves the personal exclusion toothless since virtually all personal injuries result in monetary loss. It is utterly implausible that Congress federalized every slip and fall involving RICO predicates. Personal injuries are serious and may support state tort -- tort claims, but they are not the stuff of RICO. I welcome questions.</text>","<speaker>John G.

Personal injuries are serious and may support state tort -- tort claims, but they are not the stuff of RICO. I welcome questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> What does it mean to be injured, someone to be injured, in his business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> The Court  in -- in the Clayton Act case of Reiter talked about what -- injury to business, and it was referring to anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss, it would be both a right  -- a -- a injury to both business and property, a right to carry on business. Now the lower courts pre-RICO under the Clayton Act have also recognized that an employee has a business kind of a right to carry on in his employment, and we haven't contested that. So, in those cases, if you conspired to prevent  -- in those cases, they involved encyclopedic salesmen, deprived those people of their right to carry on their profession as a salesman, the -- the lower courts recognized that that was an injury to business. So it's a right to carry on, you know, a profession or your commercial enterprise.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Can loss of employment ever constitute a injury in business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, it's -- it certainly does in the Clayton Act. And the example I could think of, the only example that r eadily comes to mind, in RICO would be the human trafficking cases, where a person is forced to work against their will, and the -- there's an injury in your right to get, you know, the -- the payment for your performed work. So that would be an injury, a direct injury, to one's business. And that human trafficking  --it's hard to see how it would otherwis e come up unless you defrauded someone into quitting their job, but, generally, lost wages are pretty standard, prototypical damages from personal injury.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you're raising an example that leads me to think that what you're really arguing about is proximate cause, meaning -- and not really whether personal injury is recoverable or not. It is under, by your own admission, certain circumstances. And, in your brief, you list a bunch of examples that seem to me quintessential personal injuries, but you related them to the business loss and then said those were recoverable.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So personal --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So it doesn't make any sense to me to say a mob can threaten a store owner to take over his business and, if he doesn't, injure him and he can't recover, but if they put a bomb in the place and close it down, they close it down by hitting him or shooting him but then throw a bomb, he can recover for the bomb but not for the injury to himself.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So no one in  -- under this statute can ever recover for personal injuries, full stop, never ever. If there's an independent infringement  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But why?  Isn't --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of the right to property  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- isn't that an issue or shouldn't it be an issue of proximate cause, which wasn't reached in this case, correct?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, no, and here's why, because a lot of examples, the plaintiff will meet a direct and proximate cause, and I can start to give you a million, but they would  still be damages resulting from personal injury. Take your  -- a shooting where someone is shot and suffers medical expenses and can't work. Direct injury, sure, the lost wages and  medical expenses, but, still, it's damages resulting from personal injury, so a proximate cause --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But, no, there's a whole lot more to RICO than simply damages. There's also the predicate that you have to have a racketeering --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For sure.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- enterprise. You have to have willful intent. In product liability cases, most of those are negligence or strict liability, so you're not going to have willfulness or intent. And, similarly, you have to show proximate causation, reasonably foreseeable. There's a serious question as to whether you shoot someone not related to the enterprise and you cause damage, but another predicate act occurs that you're going to recover. --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, in your normal case of any personal injury, you read a -- misread --a label's confuse -- misleading, you're injured, you are  -- can't work, you have lost -- lost --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You're still not</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> That's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- you're still not answering my --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I guess what  -- so two things. You can always have causation, but there's still an independent requirement that you must be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> There has to be proximate causation  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes. And there's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- which is very different.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --plenty of proximate, direct, absolute causation, no ands, ifs, or buts, but it's still just a personal injury action that's outside the scope of RICO.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> You started by talking to Justice Thomas about what it means to be injured in your business or property. Now there  might be a set of questions there that this Court has not addressed, lower courts have, but  you said lower courts have said that to -- to lose a job is to be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. Sorry. To lose a job can be both damages or an injury. It depends on the na ture of the cause of action. So you always generally, with every personal injury, can have permanent job loss. You can have lost wages. Those are damages.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's also --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It is a very rare case  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's also a loss when  --you know, it's a -- it's a harm when I lose a job. You know, I've been harmed. I lost my job. And --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> When you pay medical expenses, you're harmed as well.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> If you're harmed when you lose a job, then you've been injured in your business, haven't you?  I mean, just as -- I -- I guess what I'm saying is the simplest, clearest reading of this statutory language is it doesn't -- it doesn't distinguish by what causes the harm. It  just says, if you're harmed in a way that's in your business or property, which has been understood to include being harmed by loss of a  job, and that's by reason of a violation of Section 1962, then you're entitled to threefold the damages you would otherwise be  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the problem with that is it's reading the statute just like the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Antiterrorism Act, to say any person injured in his person can recover threefold the damages. And the --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's not reading the statute the same way as injured in his person because, if  -- if all I come in and say is, you know, I suffered emotional distress or I suffered pain and suffering, I would not be entitled to damage  -- to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So that's an infinitesimal, small number of cases that would be excluded.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> It might be an infinitesimal, small number of cases. I'm just trying to figure out -- like, that's the most normal, natural reading of the statutory language. If you've been -- it doesn't say what  you've been injured by. I mean, you have to be injured by the RICO violation. But it doesn't  distinguish among different kinds of RICO violations. It just says, if you've been injured by a RICO violation in your business --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> In your business, right.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- which includes your employment, then you're entitled to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the only way to give the statute its normal meaning of ""damages sustained"" is to distinguish between the injury. If the Respondent had hit a tree because he was impaired from THC, that would be a classic personal injury action for lost wages and medical expenses. It sounds like you think maybe the Second Circuit is right. The Second Circuit seemed to think lost wages are always recoverable, but medical expenses never would be because that results from a physical injury. And, of course, property loss, the most fundamental of all property loss is monetary loss.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But I  --I think what  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> All personal injury actions result in monetary loss except, I guess, a case where there's just exclusively psychological damage. But every slip and fall  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, I -- I don't know exactly how your rule works because, if you don't read it that normal, straightforward way, then, you know, you  -- you get into all these -- you admit in a whole set of hypos that I can do something to you that we would normally classify as a personal injury and you would be entitled to RICO damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So, if I hit you and, as a resul t of that -- this is your car wash operator example -- there's an assault that's usually understood as a personal injury, but, as a result, you decide to do business with the mobster rather than with a legitimate businessman and you say, well, notwithstanding that it was all caused by an assault, which was a personal injury, you are entitled to RICO damages. And I think you could say the same thing here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's just not our argument.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, you could have  --you could have a proximate -- well, I don't know how you get to the answers of your hypotheticals if that's not your argument.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. Whenever you have a robbery where money is taken or an extortion where money is taken or kidnapping where ransom is taken, there are two independent infringements of your legal right. You have a right to not be hit or assaulted or whatever, you know, kidnapped, and you have a right not to have your money taken. And when money is taken, you get your money back under RICO because that's a monetary independent loss. You cannot recover for physical --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, money is taken as a result of the assault. The assault happens, and then you say:  Okay, I better do business with you. So, I mean, you're  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's why our test  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's a -- it's a consequential injury from the assault.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me give you an example. If you take the money and then shove the person down the stairs, you took the money. You may have shoved the person down the stairs to prevent them from getting their money back, but our test doesn't ask which --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But that's not your own hypos. Your own hypos are things like there's an assault, there's a kidnapping, there's a murder. All of those things are personal injuries that don't have any particular economic component. As a result of those things, you lose some business opportunities, and -- and you yourself say you get RICO under that  -- you get RICO damages under those hypotheticals. So this one  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You can --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- looks pretty much like that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. You can always get RICO damages for independent property violations. And, here, there is just an allege  of a right not to have -- not to be induced to consume THC. Our position is no different than the Clayton Act. It's the exact same rule. This Court, in the Truett versus Chrysler Motor Company case, said:  No damages resulting from personal injuries. That is our test.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. Blatt, can I  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you where you get your definition of ""legal injury""?  I mean, are you looking at just kind of general tort principles?  I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out exactly how you look at it and define it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Two -- two -- two places. So, when it says, you know, this RJR Nabisco and also just the statute, you can sue and you can  sue for a personal injury, that, to me, conjures up the infringement of a right. And in WesternGeco, when the Court talked about an infringement of the patent right, it called it ""the injury.""  In Yegiazaryan, when it talked about what the injury in that case was when trying to decide if there's a domestic injury, it talked about what the racketeering activity directly did to the plaintiff. And so injury as an infringement of a legal right is a -- I think we cite Ballentine, but that is a standard definition of ""injury.""</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Where does the ""legal"" in the ""legal right"" come from?  Are you looking kind of at general principles?  You're just looking at the nature of the harm?  Does it help you in terms of property or --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, I think it's just a question of federal law. I mean, so whether you have an injury to person, property, or business, that's a question of federal law that's informed by general tort principles.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So are you looking at, like, the Restatement?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You could in the Burke case that dealt with whether something was a  personal injury on  -- sorry, damages on account of personal injury. The Court looked at things like a Dobbs and Restatements, but it was a federal question on whether the damages resulted from the personal injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Why  --why aren't you looking  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and whether there was a per  -- whether  --whether discrimination under Title VII was, in fact, a personal injury or some other kind of injury. The Court looked at a bunch of state law sources, but it was a federal law question.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, I  -- I'm trying to understand the personal injury that you say was alleged or happened in this case. I did not perceive Mr. Horn to be relying on any sort of personal injury allegation with respect to the RICO count. He doesn't say, for example, that he took the THC and that he got ill from it and, as a result of that, he took off from work and then he got fired. He says, instead, just directly, that he  --let me see --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I think  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- alleges a pattern of mail and wire fraud related to your client's alleged fraud about whether the product took -- contained THC. He relied on that, and he got fired as a result. I don't see where personal injury is doing any work in his RICO claim.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think you're correct in the complaint that the allegations we're talking about, where he's talking about physical harm, it's talking about either the -- the allegations that are general. But page 21 of our brief goes into great detail of all the other places in his affidavit and in the RICO case statement  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah, but those are in other counts. Those are in the personal injury counts. And I think that matters, right?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, not in the RICO statement. The RICO statement, by definition, is the RICO claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm saying is the question presented in this case, that you've presented, is whether economic harms resulting from personal injuries are  injuries to business and property. So I'm trying to understand the allegation of personal injury here from which  the business harm results.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah, and I guess --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He doesn't say:  My injury is resulting from a personal injury. He says:  I'm injured because I got fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, his entire causation -- and, again, I'm not just quoting from the complaint. His affidavit  -- he needs to rely on the consumption or he doesn't have causation. Consumption is personal injury. But this was litigated at the cert stage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But does your test need to rely on the consumption?  I mean, suppose there was  --suppose the employer's rule.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think that's fair, you're right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So  -- but -- but that's why I'm sort of, with Justice Kagan, trying to understand your rule. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think our rule is, if there's no personal injury, we don't need to be here and have this discussion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm asking you -- let me ask you in a hypothetical.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> All right?  So suppose we have the same basic situation, but the employer's rule is that you can't possess --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- THC. Can't have it. And he looks at all of the advertising materials. He understands that your product does not have it based on your advertising materials, and so he buys it and he has it in his locker. I think this is an example  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that the Respondents came up with.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- because the -- the  --the employer says:  You have it. You're not supposed to have it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Does he have a RICO claim or not under those circumstances?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he doesn't have a RICO claim, but it wouldn't be covered by this case because there's no personal injury. It would be no different if he was  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. You're inserting personal injury. What I'm suggesting --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Your example doesn't involve a personal injury. Now, at most -- if I can just answer the direct question. If I was that person's lawyer, I would say:  You were injured in your business or property for the purchase price. You paid  --purchase price is a classic RICO injury, classic Clayton Act. He's entitled to three times his purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So you're saying he would have a RICO claim in --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He would  -- okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But lost wages aren't -- he doesn't rely on the law  -- he --and he would fail any kind of causation test if he tried to say:  I was f ired from the purchase price. He would ultimately fail causation under three of your Supreme Court cases that say there has to be a direct relationship between the conduc t that was done to the plaintiff and the lost claim. And there, you had the independent actor of the employer. It would be no different if the employer fired him for bei ng tricked into buying baby powder that, you know, didn't have the requisite -- it might -- he might have an injury, but he just wouldn't have a RICO claim because there would be lack of causation.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and isn't that essentially what's wrong with this case too, is what Justice Sotomayor was suggesting?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It does --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, there is a definite causation problem in this case.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> His -- his -- you know, he buys this thing. He ingests this  thing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And someone else fired him.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> A different person fires him. This is not a good RICO claim for that reason, but it has nothing to do with the reason that you're  giving.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, no, no, no, no. You can win for more than one reason, Justice Kagan. The Second Circuit held that a --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you're relying on an intuition that your client should win and Ms. Anand should lose. And that intuition may be a very valid one and  -- but the -- but the intuition works because there's no  proximate cause.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But all -- with all --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> The intuition does not work because he hasn't satisfied the business or property requirement because he has. He's been injured in his person or property --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, and with all due respect  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- by reason of a RICO violation.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- with all due respect, every classic slip-and-fall personal injury case, you could talk about causation clearly,  but it would still be the lost wages, you're fired because you either can't work because you're permanently disabled, or your employer fires you because you can no longer see or have an arm.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, maybe there's  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You still lose your job, but it's  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- maybe there's also an issue  --I mean, we haven't -- we haven't decided what this ""business or property"" phrase means. Maybe ""business or property""  doesn't mean lost wages. But, again, it -- that's a -- that's a second reason why you might win but also a reason that has nothing to do with the reason that you're articulating here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Just  -- Justice Kagan, the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit hold, if  you have a personal injury, and what the other side reads the statute to say anybody injured in his person, have at it under RICO; just don't assert economic damages. That flips the statute on its head. It doesn't say anything about being injured in your person. And, under their rule, all personal injuries are recoverable under RICO, which is an absurd not just intuitive proposition, but that cannot be within the contemplation --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Can I pick up --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of Congress.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- on Justice Barrett's question?  Because I think the other side says that injury, just ordinary meaning, means harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And you say that's wrong based on an idea that ""injury"" is a term of art, I think --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- in tort law. Can you elaborate on why injury does not equal harm?  Because that's --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- front and center in their brief.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- so I think injury could mean harm just as it means the -- the legal harm that was invaded. So I don't have a problem with the word ""harm.""  But what it doesn't mean  is loss in terms of any damage. And they have no meaning or independent distinction between ""injury"" and ""damages sustained.""  And I think inherent in that distinction between the injury that -- the injury that you sue over is the type of infringement. And you have to have  -- look, everyone agrees at least I think since you've said it twice under Clayton Act and RICO that the cause of action excludes personal injuries. So what does that mean?  We think it means what it says. It excludes personal injuries. So that means the damages from personal injuries. They say no, no, no, it includes personal injuries and it includes all damages from personal injuries.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why is this a damage from personal injury?  That's the part I don't understand. He's not claiming that he got  ill because of the product. He's not saying he was personally injured. He didn't even know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that he had ingested THC until the testing and the firing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Isn't that where his injury comes in?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think -- I mean, this was the  --this was what  the other side briefed to the Second Circuit and the Second Circuit didn't decide it. But, if I ate poppyseed bagels and failed a drug test, it's a personal injury. If I took a medicine like doxycycline, which is an antibiotic, and I can't be out in the sun and I lose my job as a lifeguard, it's a personal injury claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why are you saying that?  You can -- I mean, you're just saying that. I'm asking you, you know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Why am I saying it?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- there are -- there are personal injury claims that derive  from a person being harmed by -- by the ingestion of the product, right?  They're bodily, physically harmed because they have taken this thing. I don't read this claim to be that kind of injury. He's not saying that the  product itself injured him in any way.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think it is inconsistent with all of tort law to say a bodily invasion is not a personal injury just because you didn't have to go to the hospital or cough.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He voluntarily took the product.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, we all do.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He was not invaded. He  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> We all take products that can be mislabeled. We take them and we either get sick or we don't. But we all take products and we claim, yeah, but the label told me I wasn't going to have a side effect  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and I had the side effect.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- Ms. Blatt, if I might ask you a different question. You rely  heavily on the Clayton Act and -- and the similar language there. I went and looked at the Areeda -Hovenkamp, what they have to say about this.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, dear.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I know. I know. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah. ""Oh, dear"" is right. They say:  Reiter thus made plain that the business-or-property requirement is virtually always satisfied provided there's some kind  of injury that can properly be characterized as economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Well, I don't -- I mean, that's not right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I would go -- no.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- you just disagree with Areeda  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, yeah. No, that's definitely wro ng.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. Okay. Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely. And  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That' s all I need to know. Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. No. Wrong, wrong, wrong. And Reiter, I think, I mean, says  anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss it's going to be a business or injury. But let's  -- look, there are Clayton Act cases after Clayton  -- any -- any conspiracy to affect drug prices that result in a personal injury would mean treble damages under Clayton Act. That would be a sea change -- a sea change in Clayton Act if you had personal injury recovery for price-fixing.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So even Homer nods, the great Areeda and Hovenkamp treatise wrong?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely, because you would -- you would -- that would be, like I said, a sea change under Clayton Act. I mean, it might be a boondoggle for plaintiffs' lawyers, but I think it would freak everyone else out.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, aren't you estopped from claiming that he has a personal injury here when below you argued or  your client argued that he had no personal injury, which is why all the personal injury claims were dismissed?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I don't understand how you can have it both ways.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. On page 113 of the Pet. App., the district court is recognizing that we argued, and the court said, there's no cognizable injury. But, on pages 49 and 50, which I think is pretty bad for the other side, the court is saying but there's clearly a -- this is a classic personal injury claim, which is why he can get lost wages for fraud.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. I'm talking about what you argued. Your client argued, to get rid of the personal injury claims, that he had no personal injury; the only thing was economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So -- so --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And so now that he's left with the economic, you say no, there is a personal injury and he can't get damages for that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Sorry. On pages 49 and 50, it goes through how we, the defendants, are arguing th is is a personal injury claim. So we did argue it was a personal injury claim. We  claimed what we're talking about before, there's no cognizable personal injury. It's like saying  emotional damage, it's not -- it doesn't count because you didn't have  --it didn't manifest itself in physical. So I don't think we're estopped. If you want to let that, I guess, I don't know, reverse, you'd have to reverse the rule and then decide if we're estopped, but I don't -- I'm not sure how that would work out if that's what you thought.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Do you want to respond to their invocation of the liberal construction canon?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes, a couple responses. I mean, liberal construction in light of its remedial purposes, but the one thing all nine of you should agree on, its remedial purposes did not extend to personal injuries. You've already said that twice, in the Clayton Act and in RJR Nabisco. It doesn't extend to remediate personal injury. Second of all, I think it's a tie-breaker. Their  -- their serious reading of the statute inserts the word ""injured in its person"" to read just like the Antiterrorism Act. And, finally, I think it does run up against the constitutional principle of federalism, that their view does cannibalize all of state tort law. Every -- every slip and fall from a mislabel now is a RICO case. So I think, I mean, that should be  -- the Court -- I mean, one more thing I'll try on that, the Court last cited that clause in 1985. I mean, it hasn't relied on it since and says you shouldn't use it to put RICO in contexts that Congress, you know, didn't want or couldn't have contemplated. And, here, it is just so  -- would be so striking to think that RICO remedied personal injuries.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say that under RICO, injury is ""the invasion of a legal right.""  So how would we go about determining  whether something is a legal right for this purpose?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, first, you look at the complaint. I think property's pretty easy because the Court has already said any monetary  loss is a property loss. So, I mean, you could quibble about whether loss of consortium, if state law defines that as a property loss. And then injury is also, I think, pretty easy  because that involves the body.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, what authorities would we look at?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh. Look at the complaint. Look at state law general tort principles. Again, that Burke case  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> General tort principles?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. What Burke said is -- which I like because it -- I think it works -- is that are the damages -- what are the damages seeking to redress?  Are the damages redressing a  --something that happened to the body, are they redressing stolen property, or  are they redressing a right to carry on in your business?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you rely a lot on WesternGeco. You mentioned it a  few minutes ago.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you ignore its language where they differentiate a patent case where the legal right is the right not to be infringed and where you feel the economic loss is different. And we said there that the Patent Act was different from civil RICO because the question in civil RICO is where the plaintiff feels the injury, in other words, where he suffers the economic harm that the damages compensate. So why should we think -- in -- in Sedima, we were very, very clear that RICO doesn't rely on state law -- state tort law concepts. We said that explicitly. What we  said was that RICO complicates injuries to have been caused by predicate acts. That's our --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and we explicitly -- explicitly say:  Not otherwise an  injury cognizable under state tort law.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's even better for me because our position is you shouldn't -- you can't get recovery that's -- that's caused by personal injury, which I think this case is. But, on RJR Nabisco -- sorry, the WesternGeco citing RJR Nabisco, I didn't --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that goes back to what Justice Jackson and  -- and what I tried earlier and Justice Kagan point out:  You're trying to say there's a difference between the two. But we've made very clear in WesternGeco there isn't. Injury is where you feel the harm. Now the question is:  What's the harm?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yegiazaryan said the opposite. Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as Justice Jackson said, the harm is not ingesting the drugs. That's the personal injury. The harm is from being fired. And whether there's a connection between the predicate acts and that harm  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- is a question of proximate cause, not a question of personal injury.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan is the most recent case where you said the injury was -- the inability to collect the California judgment was a domestic injury. You did not say it was the injury where all the effects were felt, which were a million different places  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that has nothing to do with the language of RICO -- of RICO, which says --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It was the language of</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- compensable injuries are the harms caused by predicate acts. And that's what we said in WesternGeco.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It's where you feel the harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan quotes that exact same language, and I think it's talk -- it begs the question about what is the harm talking about. Is it the harm that's the legal invasion of the right, or is it the damages at the end of the day?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask you about a hypo?  Because I'm still trying to understand your rule. You seem to be suggesting that the mere existence of physical harm renders any business injury not compensable. Is that  -- is that the  --do I have the sum total of your --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No?  Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because you just said --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So what is your rule?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --you just -- because you just said it's any personal injury renders the -- 40 damages  not recoverable. Obviously, if you have a business injury, a property injury, you can recover damages.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even if you have a physical injury too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely, because that's the example of a robbery. If you are thrown down a flight of stairs and they take your wallet, you have two injuries. You fell down the stairs and you lost your wallet.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You've got -- so you have a property injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- and a personal injury</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --two independent invasions.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and so, here, you say he took the drugs and that was an injury. And he says:  I was also fired. Why isn't that  two injuries too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because every  -- you would -- because -- because that conflates damages. Every personal injury, you could say I slip and fell --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But this is -- imagine that this is not damages in the following sense, all right?  If we have a case  in which he takes the drugs --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and, as a result of taking the drugs, he has to go to  the hospital, and, as a result of being in the hospital, he can't work.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I kind of understand the argument you're making. But, in this situation, he takes the drugs and there is no harm --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to him from taking the drugs.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me leave you with one more example. He goes to the hospital and he loses his sight and he can't drive anymore, so he gets fired. He still has a loss of employment. It is a damage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. But that's not this case. Nothing happened to him as a result of taking the drugs. Instead, what happened to him, I think -- and this is -- maybe I'm just not understanding.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he failed a drug test. It changed his -- well, allegedly, it had THC in it. I think it's the same thing as if you took something and had an allergic reaction. It's a physical, chemical, bodily invasion. He didn't want  -- he didn't want THC and he took it. It's like taking cocaine. That's a  -- to me, that's a physical injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- whether or not you hid something.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anand.</text>",coherent
2024.23-365 -t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh, -- in tort law. Can you elaborate on why injury does not equal harm?  Because that's --,"<speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Thank you, and may it please the Court:  RICO states that any person injured in his business or property by reason of racketeering can sue therefor and recover threefold the damages he sustains. Because RICO's cause of action excludes personal injuries, RICO excludes damages resulting from personal injuries. The text differentiates the injury from racketeering and the damages sustained from that injury, thus showing that injury and damages are distinct. And the references to damages he sustains shows that damages are the losses suffere d as a result of the injury. Damages are not themselves the injury inflicted by the defendant. This distinction tracks this Court's recognition that lost wages and medical expenses are classic damages from personal injuries. Respondent's complaint alleges  the personal injury of unwanted ingestion of THC and the resulting damages of lost wages. To quote the complaint:  ""Defendant's behavior caused  Plaintiff's fiscal harm in the ingestion of Dixie, and as a direct result of consuming this  product, he was dismissed from his employment."" That's a personal injury claim outside civil RICO. Respondent argues that every economic loss is its own RICO injury but not to worry because RICO still bars non-pecuniary damages. But that view conflates injury and damages by treating RICO's exclusion of personal injuries as just excluding a narrow type of damages: pain and suffering and emotional distress. Respondent's rule also leaves the personal exclusion toothless since virtually all personal injuries result in monetary loss. It is utterly implausible that Congress federalized every slip and fall involving RICO predicates. Personal injuries are serious and may support state tort -- tort claims, but they are not the stuff of RICO. I welcome questions.</text>","<speaker>John G.

I welcome questions.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> What does it mean to be injured, someone to be injured, in his business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> The Court  in -- in the Clayton Act case of Reiter talked about what -- injury to business, and it was referring to anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss, it would be both a right  -- a -- a injury to both business and property, a right to carry on business. Now the lower courts pre-RICO under the Clayton Act have also recognized that an employee has a business kind of a right to carry on in his employment, and we haven't contested that. So, in those cases, if you conspired to prevent  -- in those cases, they involved encyclopedic salesmen, deprived those people of their right to carry on their profession as a salesman, the -- the lower courts recognized that that was an injury to business. So it's a right to carry on, you know, a profession or your commercial enterprise.</text><speaker>Clarence Thomas</speaker><text> Can loss of employment ever constitute a injury in business?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, it's -- it certainly does in the Clayton Act. And the example I could think of, the only example that r eadily comes to mind, in RICO would be the human trafficking cases, where a person is forced to work against their will, and the -- there's an injury in your right to get, you know, the -- the payment for your performed work. So that would be an injury, a direct injury, to one's business. And that human trafficking  --it's hard to see how it would otherwis e come up unless you defrauded someone into quitting their job, but, generally, lost wages are pretty standard, prototypical damages from personal injury.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you're raising an example that leads me to think that what you're really arguing about is proximate cause, meaning -- and not really whether personal injury is recoverable or not. It is under, by your own admission, certain circumstances. And, in your brief, you list a bunch of examples that seem to me quintessential personal injuries, but you related them to the business loss and then said those were recoverable.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So personal --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> So it doesn't make any sense to me to say a mob can threaten a store owner to take over his business and, if he doesn't, injure him and he can't recover, but if they put a bomb in the place and close it down, they close it down by hitting him or shooting him but then throw a bomb, he can recover for the bomb but not for the injury to himself.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So no one in  -- under this statute can ever recover for personal injuries, full stop, never ever. If there's an independent infringement  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But why?  Isn't --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of the right to property  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- isn't that an issue or shouldn't it be an issue of proximate cause, which wasn't reached in this case, correct?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, no, and here's why, because a lot of examples, the plaintiff will meet a direct and proximate cause, and I can start to give you a million, but they would  still be damages resulting from personal injury. Take your  -- a shooting where someone is shot and suffers medical expenses and can't work. Direct injury, sure, the lost wages and  medical expenses, but, still, it's damages resulting from personal injury, so a proximate cause --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But, no, there's a whole lot more to RICO than simply damages. There's also the predicate that you have to have a racketeering --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For sure.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- enterprise. You have to have willful intent. In product liability cases, most of those are negligence or strict liability, so you're not going to have willfulness or intent. And, similarly, you have to show proximate causation, reasonably foreseeable. There's a serious question as to whether you shoot someone not related to the enterprise and you cause damage, but another predicate act occurs that you're going to recover. --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, in your normal case of any personal injury, you read a -- misread --a label's confuse -- misleading, you're injured, you are  -- can't work, you have lost -- lost --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> You're still not</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> That's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- you're still not answering my --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I guess what  -- so two things. You can always have causation, but there's still an independent requirement that you must be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> There has to be proximate causation  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes. And there's --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- which is very different.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --plenty of proximate, direct, absolute causation, no ands, ifs, or buts, but it's still just a personal injury action that's outside the scope of RICO.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> You started by talking to Justice Thomas about what it means to be injured in your business or property. Now there  might be a set of questions there that this Court has not addressed, lower courts have, but  you said lower courts have said that to -- to lose a job is to be injured in your business or property.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. Sorry. To lose a job can be both damages or an injury. It depends on the na ture of the cause of action. So you always generally, with every personal injury, can have permanent job loss. You can have lost wages. Those are damages.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's also --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It is a very rare case  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's also a loss when  --you know, it's a -- it's a harm when I lose a job. You know, I've been harmed. I lost my job. And --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> When you pay medical expenses, you're harmed as well.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> If you're harmed when you lose a job, then you've been injured in your business, haven't you?  I mean, just as -- I -- I guess what I'm saying is the simplest, clearest reading of this statutory language is it doesn't -- it doesn't distinguish by what causes the harm. It  just says, if you're harmed in a way that's in your business or property, which has been understood to include being harmed by loss of a  job, and that's by reason of a violation of Section 1962, then you're entitled to threefold the damages you would otherwise be  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the problem with that is it's reading the statute just like the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Antiterrorism Act, to say any person injured in his person can recover threefold the damages. And the --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, it's not reading the statute the same way as injured in his person because, if  -- if all I come in and say is, you know, I suffered emotional distress or I suffered pain and suffering, I would not be entitled to damage  -- to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So that's an infinitesimal, small number of cases that would be excluded.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> It might be an infinitesimal, small number of cases. I'm just trying to figure out -- like, that's the most normal, natural reading of the statutory language. If you've been -- it doesn't say what  you've been injured by. I mean, you have to be injured by the RICO violation. But it doesn't  distinguish among different kinds of RICO violations. It just says, if you've been injured by a RICO violation in your business --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> In your business, right.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- which includes your employment, then you're entitled to threefold damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And the only way to give the statute its normal meaning of ""damages sustained"" is to distinguish between the injury. If the Respondent had hit a tree because he was impaired from THC, that would be a classic personal injury action for lost wages and medical expenses. It sounds like you think maybe the Second Circuit is right. The Second Circuit seemed to think lost wages are always recoverable, but medical expenses never would be because that results from a physical injury. And, of course, property loss, the most fundamental of all property loss is monetary loss.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But I  --I think what  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> All personal injury actions result in monetary loss except, I guess, a case where there's just exclusively psychological damage. But every slip and fall  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, I -- I don't know exactly how your rule works because, if you don't read it that normal, straightforward way, then, you know, you  -- you get into all these -- you admit in a whole set of hypos that I can do something to you that we would normally classify as a personal injury and you would be entitled to RICO damages.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> So, if I hit you and, as a resul t of that -- this is your car wash operator example -- there's an assault that's usually understood as a personal injury, but, as a result, you decide to do business with the mobster rather than with a legitimate businessman and you say, well, notwithstanding that it was all caused by an assault, which was a personal injury, you are entitled to RICO damages. And I think you could say the same thing here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's just not our argument.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, you could have  --you could have a proximate -- well, I don't know how you get to the answers of your hypotheticals if that's not your argument.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. Whenever you have a robbery where money is taken or an extortion where money is taken or kidnapping where ransom is taken, there are two independent infringements of your legal right. You have a right to not be hit or assaulted or whatever, you know, kidnapped, and you have a right not to have your money taken. And when money is taken, you get your money back under RICO because that's a monetary independent loss. You cannot recover for physical --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, money is taken as a result of the assault. The assault happens, and then you say:  Okay, I better do business with you. So, I mean, you're  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's why our test  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- it's a -- it's a consequential injury from the assault.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me give you an example. If you take the money and then shove the person down the stairs, you took the money. You may have shoved the person down the stairs to prevent them from getting their money back, but our test doesn't ask which --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But that's not your own hypos. Your own hypos are things like there's an assault, there's a kidnapping, there's a murder. All of those things are personal injuries that don't have any particular economic component. As a result of those things, you lose some business opportunities, and -- and you yourself say you get RICO under that  -- you get RICO damages under those hypotheticals. So this one  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You can --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- looks pretty much like that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No. You can always get RICO damages for independent property violations. And, here, there is just an allege  of a right not to have -- not to be induced to consume THC. Our position is no different than the Clayton Act. It's the exact same rule. This Court, in the Truett versus Chrysler Motor Company case, said:  No damages resulting from personal injuries. That is our test.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But, Ms. Blatt, can I  --</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Go ahead.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, can I ask you where you get your definition of ""legal injury""?  I mean, are you looking at just kind of general tort principles?  I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out exactly how you look at it and define it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Two -- two -- two places. So, when it says, you know, this RJR Nabisco and also just the statute, you can sue and you can  sue for a personal injury, that, to me, conjures up the infringement of a right. And in WesternGeco, when the Court talked about an infringement of the patent right, it called it ""the injury.""  In Yegiazaryan, when it talked about what the injury in that case was when trying to decide if there's a domestic injury, it talked about what the racketeering activity directly did to the plaintiff. And so injury as an infringement of a legal right is a -- I think we cite Ballentine, but that is a standard definition of ""injury.""</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> Where does the ""legal"" in the ""legal right"" come from?  Are you looking kind of at general principles?  You're just looking at the nature of the harm?  Does it help you in terms of property or --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, I think it's just a question of federal law. I mean, so whether you have an injury to person, property, or business, that's a question of federal law that's informed by general tort principles.</text><speaker>Amy Coney Barrett</speaker><text> So are you looking at, like, the Restatement?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You could in the Burke case that dealt with whether something was a  personal injury on  -- sorry, damages on account of personal injury. The Court looked at things like a Dobbs and Restatements, but it was a federal question on whether the damages resulted from the personal injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Why  --why aren't you looking  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and whether there was a per  -- whether  --whether discrimination under Title VII was, in fact, a personal injury or some other kind of injury. The Court looked at a bunch of state law sources, but it was a federal law question.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, I  -- I'm trying to understand the personal injury that you say was alleged or happened in this case. I did not perceive Mr. Horn to be relying on any sort of personal injury allegation with respect to the RICO count. He doesn't say, for example, that he took the THC and that he got ill from it and, as a result of that, he took off from work and then he got fired. He says, instead, just directly, that he  --let me see --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, I think  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- alleges a pattern of mail and wire fraud related to your client's alleged fraud about whether the product took -- contained THC. He relied on that, and he got fired as a result. I don't see where personal injury is doing any work in his RICO claim.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think you're correct in the complaint that the allegations we're talking about, where he's talking about physical harm, it's talking about either the -- the allegations that are general. But page 21 of our brief goes into great detail of all the other places in his affidavit and in the RICO case statement  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Yeah, but those are in other counts. Those are in the personal injury counts. And I think that matters, right?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, not in the RICO statement. The RICO statement, by definition, is the RICO claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm saying is the question presented in this case, that you've presented, is whether economic harms resulting from personal injuries are  injuries to business and property. So I'm trying to understand the allegation of personal injury here from which  the business harm results.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah, and I guess --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He doesn't say:  My injury is resulting from a personal injury. He says:  I'm injured because I got fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, his entire causation -- and, again, I'm not just quoting from the complaint. His affidavit  -- he needs to rely on the consumption or he doesn't have causation. Consumption is personal injury. But this was litigated at the cert stage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But does your test need to rely on the consumption?  I mean, suppose there was  --suppose the employer's rule.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think that's fair, you're right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So  -- but -- but that's why I'm sort of, with Justice Kagan, trying to understand your rule. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think our rule is, if there's no personal injury, we don't need to be here and have this discussion.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. What I'm asking you -- let me ask you in a hypothetical.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> All right?  So suppose we have the same basic situation, but the employer's rule is that you can't possess --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- THC. Can't have it. And he looks at all of the advertising materials. He understands that your product does not have it based on your advertising materials, and so he buys it and he has it in his locker. I think this is an example  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that the Respondents came up with.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- because the -- the  --the employer says:  You have it. You're not supposed to have it.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Does he have a RICO claim or not under those circumstances?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he doesn't have a RICO claim, but it wouldn't be covered by this case because there's no personal injury. It would be no different if he was  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No, no, no. You're inserting personal injury. What I'm suggesting --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Your example doesn't involve a personal injury. Now, at most -- if I can just answer the direct question. If I was that person's lawyer, I would say:  You were injured in your business or property for the purchase price. You paid  --purchase price is a classic RICO injury, classic Clayton Act. He's entitled to three times his purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So you're saying he would have a RICO claim in --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> For purchase price.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He would  -- okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But lost wages aren't -- he doesn't rely on the law  -- he --and he would fail any kind of causation test if he tried to say:  I was f ired from the purchase price. He would ultimately fail causation under three of your Supreme Court cases that say there has to be a direct relationship between the conduc t that was done to the plaintiff and the lost claim. And there, you had the independent actor of the employer. It would be no different if the employer fired him for bei ng tricked into buying baby powder that, you know, didn't have the requisite -- it might -- he might have an injury, but he just wouldn't have a RICO claim because there would be lack of causation.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> And -- and isn't that essentially what's wrong with this case too, is what Justice Sotomayor was suggesting?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It does --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> I mean, there is a definite causation problem in this case.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> His -- his -- you know, he buys this thing. He ingests this  thing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> And someone else fired him.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> A different person fires him. This is not a good RICO claim for that reason, but it has nothing to do with the reason that you're  giving.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, no, no, no, no. You can win for more than one reason, Justice Kagan. The Second Circuit held that a --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> But you're relying on an intuition that your client should win and Ms. Anand should lose. And that intuition may be a very valid one and  -- but the -- but the intuition works because there's no  proximate cause.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But all -- with all --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> The intuition does not work because he hasn't satisfied the business or property requirement because he has. He's been injured in his person or property --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, and with all due respect  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- by reason of a RICO violation.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- with all due respect, every classic slip-and-fall personal injury case, you could talk about causation clearly,  but it would still be the lost wages, you're fired because you either can't work because you're permanently disabled, or your employer fires you because you can no longer see or have an arm.</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> Well, maybe there's  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You still lose your job, but it's  --</text><speaker>Elena Kagan</speaker><text> -- maybe there's also an issue  --I mean, we haven't -- we haven't decided what this ""business or property"" phrase means. Maybe ""business or property""  doesn't mean lost wages. But, again, it -- that's a -- that's a second reason why you might win but also a reason that has nothing to do with the reason that you're articulating here.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Just  -- Justice Kagan, the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit hold, if  you have a personal injury, and what the other side reads the statute to say anybody injured in his person, have at it under RICO; just don't assert economic damages. That flips the statute on its head. It doesn't say anything about being injured in your person. And, under their rule, all personal injuries are recoverable under RICO, which is an absurd not just intuitive proposition, but that cannot be within the contemplation --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Can I pick up --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- of Congress.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- on Justice Barrett's question?  Because I think the other side says that injury, just ordinary meaning, means harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> And you say that's wrong based on an idea that ""injury"" is a term of art, I think --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- in tort law. Can you elaborate on why injury does not equal harm?  Because that's --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> -- front and center in their brief.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- so I think injury could mean harm just as it means the -- the legal harm that was invaded. So I don't have a problem with the word ""harm.""  But what it doesn't mean  is loss in terms of any damage. And they have no meaning or independent distinction between ""injury"" and ""damages sustained.""  And I think inherent in that distinction between the injury that -- the injury that you sue over is the type of infringement. And you have to have  -- look, everyone agrees at least I think since you've said it twice under Clayton Act and RICO that the cause of action excludes personal injuries. So what does that mean?  We think it means what it says. It excludes personal injuries. So that means the damages from personal injuries. They say no, no, no, it includes personal injuries and it includes all damages from personal injuries.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why is this a damage from personal injury?  That's the part I don't understand. He's not claiming that he got  ill because of the product. He's not saying he was personally injured. He didn't even know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> True.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- that he had ingested THC until the testing and the firing.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Isn't that where his injury comes in?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think -- I mean, this was the  --this was what  the other side briefed to the Second Circuit and the Second Circuit didn't decide it. But, if I ate poppyseed bagels and failed a drug test, it's a personal injury. If I took a medicine like doxycycline, which is an antibiotic, and I can't be out in the sun and I lose my job as a lifeguard, it's a personal injury claim.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But why are you saying that?  You can -- I mean, you're just saying that. I'm asking you, you know --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Why am I saying it?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- there are -- there are personal injury claims that derive  from a person being harmed by -- by the ingestion of the product, right?  They're bodily, physically harmed because they have taken this thing. I don't read this claim to be that kind of injury. He's not saying that the  product itself injured him in any way.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I think it is inconsistent with all of tort law to say a bodily invasion is not a personal injury just because you didn't have to go to the hospital or cough.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He voluntarily took the product.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, we all do.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> He was not invaded. He  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> We all take products that can be mislabeled. We take them and we either get sick or we don't. But we all take products and we claim, yeah, but the label told me I wasn't going to have a side effect  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --and I had the side effect.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- Ms. Blatt, if I might ask you a different question. You rely  heavily on the Clayton Act and -- and the similar language there. I went and looked at the Areeda -Hovenkamp, what they have to say about this.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, dear.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> I know. I know. (Laughter.)</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Yeah. ""Oh, dear"" is right. They say:  Reiter thus made plain that the business-or-property requirement is virtually always satisfied provided there's some kind  of injury that can properly be characterized as economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Well, I don't -- I mean, that's not right.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. So  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> I would go -- no.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> -- you just disagree with Areeda  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh, yeah. No, that's definitely wro ng.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay. Okay. Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely. And  --</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> That' s all I need to know. Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. No. Wrong, wrong, wrong. And Reiter, I think, I mean, says  anytime a commercial enterprise suffers any monetary loss it's going to be a business or injury. But let's  -- look, there are Clayton Act cases after Clayton  -- any -- any conspiracy to affect drug prices that result in a personal injury would mean treble damages under Clayton Act. That would be a sea change -- a sea change in Clayton Act if you had personal injury recovery for price-fixing.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> So even Homer nods, the great Areeda and Hovenkamp treatise wrong?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely.</text><speaker>Neil Gorsuch</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No, absolutely, because you would -- you would -- that would be, like I said, a sea change under Clayton Act. I mean, it might be a boondoggle for plaintiffs' lawyers, but I think it would freak everyone else out.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, aren't you estopped from claiming that he has a personal injury here when below you argued or  your client argued that he had no personal injury, which is why all the personal injury claims were dismissed?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I don't understand how you can have it both ways.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Sure. On page 113 of the Pet. App., the district court is recognizing that we argued, and the court said, there's no cognizable injury. But, on pages 49 and 50, which I think is pretty bad for the other side, the court is saying but there's clearly a -- this is a classic personal injury claim, which is why he can get lost wages for fraud.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. I'm talking about what you argued. Your client argued, to get rid of the personal injury claims, that he had no personal injury; the only thing was economic.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So -- so --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And so now that he's left with the economic, you say no, there is a personal injury and he can't get damages for that.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. Sorry. On pages 49 and 50, it goes through how we, the defendants, are arguing th is is a personal injury claim. So we did argue it was a personal injury claim. We  claimed what we're talking about before, there's no cognizable personal injury. It's like saying  emotional damage, it's not -- it doesn't count because you didn't have  --it didn't manifest itself in physical. So I don't think we're estopped. If you want to let that, I guess, I don't know, reverse, you'd have to reverse the rule and then decide if we're estopped, but I don't -- I'm not sure how that would work out if that's what you thought.</text><speaker>Brett M. Kavanaugh</speaker><text> Do you want to respond to their invocation of the liberal construction canon?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yes, a couple responses. I mean, liberal construction in light of its remedial purposes, but the one thing all nine of you should agree on, its remedial purposes did not extend to personal injuries. You've already said that twice, in the Clayton Act and in RJR Nabisco. It doesn't extend to remediate personal injury. Second of all, I think it's a tie-breaker. Their  -- their serious reading of the statute inserts the word ""injured in its person"" to read just like the Antiterrorism Act. And, finally, I think it does run up against the constitutional principle of federalism, that their view does cannibalize all of state tort law. Every -- every slip and fall from a mislabel now is a RICO case. So I think, I mean, that should be  -- the Court -- I mean, one more thing I'll try on that, the Court last cited that clause in 1985. I mean, it hasn't relied on it since and says you shouldn't use it to put RICO in contexts that Congress, you know, didn't want or couldn't have contemplated. And, here, it is just so  -- would be so striking to think that RICO remedied personal injuries.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything? Justice Alito?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, you say that under RICO, injury is ""the invasion of a legal right.""  So how would we go about determining  whether something is a legal right for this purpose?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So, first, you look at the complaint. I think property's pretty easy because the Court has already said any monetary  loss is a property loss. So, I mean, you could quibble about whether loss of consortium, if state law defines that as a property loss. And then injury is also, I think, pretty easy  because that involves the body.</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> Well, what authorities would we look at?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Oh. Look at the complaint. Look at state law general tort principles. Again, that Burke case  --</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> General tort principles?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. What Burke said is -- which I like because it -- I think it works -- is that are the damages -- what are the damages seeking to redress?  Are the damages redressing a  --something that happened to the body, are they redressing stolen property, or  are they redressing a right to carry on in your business?</text><speaker>Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</speaker><text> All right. Thank you.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Sotomayor?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Ms. Blatt, you rely a lot on WesternGeco. You mentioned it a  few minutes ago.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But you ignore its language where they differentiate a patent case where the legal right is the right not to be infringed and where you feel the economic loss is different. And we said there that the Patent Act was different from civil RICO because the question in civil RICO is where the plaintiff feels the injury, in other words, where he suffers the economic harm that the damages compensate. So why should we think -- in -- in Sedima, we were very, very clear that RICO doesn't rely on state law -- state tort law concepts. We said that explicitly. What we  said was that RICO complicates injuries to have been caused by predicate acts. That's our --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- and we explicitly -- explicitly say:  Not otherwise an  injury cognizable under state tort law.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> But that's even better for me because our position is you shouldn't -- you can't get recovery that's -- that's caused by personal injury, which I think this case is. But, on RJR Nabisco -- sorry, the WesternGeco citing RJR Nabisco, I didn't --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that goes back to what Justice Jackson and  -- and what I tried earlier and Justice Kagan point out:  You're trying to say there's a difference between the two. But we've made very clear in WesternGeco there isn't. Injury is where you feel the harm. Now the question is:  What's the harm?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yegiazaryan said the opposite. Yeah.</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> And, as Justice Jackson said, the harm is not ingesting the drugs. That's the personal injury. The harm is from being fired. And whether there's a connection between the predicate acts and that harm  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- is a question of proximate cause, not a question of personal injury.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan is the most recent case where you said the injury was -- the inability to collect the California judgment was a domestic injury. You did not say it was the injury where all the effects were felt, which were a million different places  --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> But that has nothing to do with the language of RICO -- of RICO, which says --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> It was the language of</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> -- compensable injuries are the harms caused by predicate acts. And that's what we said in WesternGeco.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Yeah. So --</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> It's where you feel the harm.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- Yegiazaryan quotes that exact same language, and I think it's talk -- it begs the question about what is the harm talking about. Is it the harm that's the legal invasion of the right, or is it the damages at the end of the day?</text><speaker>Sonia Sotomayor</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch? Justice Kavanaugh? Justice Jackson?</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Can I just ask you about a hypo?  Because I'm still trying to understand your rule. You seem to be suggesting that the mere existence of physical harm renders any business injury not compensable. Is that  -- is that the  --do I have the sum total of your --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> No.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> No?  Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because you just said --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> So what is your rule?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --you just -- because you just said it's any personal injury renders the -- 40 damages  not recoverable. Obviously, if you have a business injury, a property injury, you can recover damages.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Even if you have a physical injury too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Absolutely, because that's the example of a robbery. If you are thrown down a flight of stairs and they take your wallet, you have two injuries. You fell down the stairs and you lost your wallet.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> You've got -- so you have a property injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- and a personal injury</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And  --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> --two independent invasions.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and so, here, you say he took the drugs and that was an injury. And he says:  I was also fired. Why isn't that  two injuries too?</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Because every  -- you would -- because -- because that conflates damages. Every personal injury, you could say I slip and fell --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> But this is -- imagine that this is not damages in the following sense, all right?  If we have a case  in which he takes the drugs --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- and, as a result of taking the drugs, he has to go to  the hospital, and, as a result of being in the hospital, he can't work.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Mm-hmm.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> And then he's fired.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Right.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I kind of understand the argument you're making. But, in this situation, he takes the drugs and there is no harm --</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Okay.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> -- to him from taking the drugs.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Let me leave you with one more example. He goes to the hospital and he loses his sight and he can't drive anymore, so he gets fired. He still has a loss of employment. It is a damage.</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> I understand. But that's not this case. Nothing happened to him as a result of taking the drugs. Instead, what happened to him, I think -- and this is -- maybe I'm just not understanding.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> Well, he failed a drug test. It changed his -- well, allegedly, it had THC in it. I think it's the same thing as if you took something and had an allergic reaction. It's a physical, chemical, bodily invasion. He didn't want  -- he didn't want THC and he took it. It's like taking cocaine. That's a  -- to me, that's a physical injury  --</text><speaker>Ketanji Brown Jackson</speaker><text> Thank you.</text><speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text> -- whether or not you hid something.</text><speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text> Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anand.</text>",coherent
