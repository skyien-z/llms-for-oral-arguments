34837,2023.23-108 -t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch, How do you know if it's wrongful if it's --  if it's perfectly legal?,"<speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The federal government needs to ensure the money it appropriates to local governments for public benefits is allocated in a way that maximizes the benefits to its citizens, not the rewards for local officials. Congress, therefore, enacted Section 666 to bar officials from corruptly accepting payments with the intent to be influenced or rewarded in connection with their official duties. Petitioner asks this Court to weaken Section 666's protection for the public fisc by holding that a person does not violate Section 666 when he corruptly solicits a payment with the intent to be rewarded unless he has also agreed to accept the reward beforehand. But that requirement of a beforehand- agreement finds no basis in the statutory text. The plain meaning of ""reward"" readily covers a payment given in return for an official action or decision that is already complete. So a police chief who sends his officers to foil a burglary at a store and then demands the store owner pay him $10,000 for his officers' work, he acts with the intent to be rewarded. A safety inspector who issues a building permit for a dangerous project and then solicits a $30,000 payment acts with the intent to be rewarded. And a mayor who steers a contract for a particular business and then asks that business to pay him $13,000 for the contract acts with the intent to be rewarded, whether or not the contractor agreed to give him the reward before the contract closed. Petitioner's argument to the contrary ignores both the plain meaning of the term ""rewarded"" and the statutory history. In 1984, Congress enacted a flat bar on the acceptance of bribes and gratuities. It was modeled dire ctly on the one in Section 201(c) that applies to federal employees. In 1986, Congress narrowed that bar to carve out a subset of only the most culpable gratuities by adding a corruptly mens rea and an express exception for bona fide salary and benefits paid in the ordinary course of business. Now Congress's textual fix worked. Petitioners haven't pointed to any real -world examples of Section 666 prosecutions for the sort of innocuous gift -giving activity that occurs in the ordinary course of business, and I'm happy to explain why the  -- the two examples in their reply brief really just aren't what they are describing.

Petitioner's argument to the contrary ignores both the plain meaning of the term ""rewarded"" and the statutory history.

35022,2023.23-370-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," Mr. Fisher, wouldn't it be more straightforward to overrule Almendarez -Torres?","<speaker>Jeffrey L. Fisher</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Robust and clear precedent dictates the outcome here. In case after case, this Court has held that judges applying ACCA may find only what crime with what -- what crime with what elements a defendant was previously convicted of, nothing more. And the Court has grounded that rule directly in the Sixth Amendment. A judge may not increase a defendant's sentencing range based on offense -related conduct that the prior jury did not need to find. ACCA's occasions clause, as this Court construed it in Wooden, requires exactly that kind of factual inquiry. The whole point of the clause, in fact, is to require something more than just three convictions before an ACCA sentence is imposed. As such, the Apprendi rule  directly applies to it. That leaves amicus's objection that the Court should eschew that straightforward analysis because applying the Sixth Amendment here would somehow harm defendants.

And I guess what I want to ask you is whether you think reasonableness is the same as standard rationality review, because, as I look at the cases, like, reasonableness is definitely not heightened scrutiny, intermediate or strict. But, when the court says we look for reasonableness, it tends to do a couple of things. It tends to look at the other expressive opportunities that a speaker has, and it tends to look at whether, even though something is not viewpoint-based, there's a fear that official suppression of ideas is afoot. And so that doesn't seem like really rational basis scrutiny to me. It seems like, look, we understand that this is a sensitive area. We -- we're not allowing viewpoint-based discrimination. We also want to look, even if it's not facial, is it sort of lurking someplace? We want to look at other expressive opportunities. So -- so that's my question.","<speaker>Malcolm L.

That is incorrect. For three reasons, the clause should be subjected to heightened scrutiny. First, the clause withholds valuable legal protections generally available to all trademark holders who pay the fee, including presumptive validity, protection against certain defenses, and incontestability, and it does so based solely on the applicant's speech. That selective content-based withholding of generally available legal protections is a substantial burden on speech.

The government's interest in discouraging marks because they hurt the feelings of public figures has nothing to do with the purposes of trademark registration. Third, the names clause involves express speaker-based discrimination of the kind that lends itself to viewpoint discrimination. Under the clause, public figures may use their names on registered marks to express their own presumably positive views about themselves, but no one else can, unless they get consent.

35706,2023.22-704-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch,"Common law, there's a long and robust history about restricting names. Now sometimes they took on secondary meanings, like Brooks Brothers, all right, but that was pretty rare. And trademarks always had some content-based restrictions if you want to use that kind of abstract heuristic, geographic names, descriptions, functions generally, there are always exceptions, but generally not trademarkable. And I guess I -- I'm kind of stuck where my friend down the bench is. You know, we can put whatever abstract labels around it, limited public fora, content-based, but, at the end of the day, it's pretty hard to argue that a tradition that's been around a long, long time, since the founding, you know, common law type stuff, is -- is -- is inconsistent with the First Amendment.

The Colorado Supreme Court's decision is wrong and should be reversed for numerous independent reasons. The first reason is that President Trump is not covered by Section 3 because the President is not ""an officer of the United States"" as that term is used throughout the Constitution. ""Officer of the United States"" refers only to appointed officials, and it does not encompass elected individuals, such as the President or members of Congress. This is clear from the Commissions Clause, the Impeachment Clause, and the Appointments Clause, each of which uses ""officer of the United States"" to refer only to appointed and not elected officials. The second reason is that Section 3 cannot be used to exclude a presidential candidate from the ballot even if that candidate is disqualified from serving as president under Section 3 because Congress can lift that disability after the candidate is elected but before he takes office. A state cannot exclude any candidate for federal office from the ballot on account of Section 3, and any state that does so is violating the holding of Term Limits by altering the Constitution's qualifications for federal office. The Colorado Supreme Court's decision is no different from a state residency law that requires members of Congress to inhabit the state prior to Election Day, when the Constitution requires only that members of Congress inhabit the state that they represent when elected. In both situations, a state is accelerating the deadline to meet a constitutionally imposed qualification and is thereby violating the holding of Term Limits.

Second question, some of the rhetoric of your position -- I don't think it is your position, but some of the rhetoric of your position seems to suggest, unless the states can do this, no one can prevent insurrectionists from holding federal office.

You said, I think, that the Framers actually envisioned states enforcing Section 3, at least in some circumstances where there were insurgents and Confederates.

Mitchell</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Colorado Supreme Court held that President Donald J. Trump is constitutionally disqualified from serving as president under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Colorado Supreme Court's decision is wrong and should be reversed for numerous independent reasons. The first reason is that President Trump is not covered by Section 3 because the President is not ""an officer of the United States"" as that term is used throughout the Constitution. ""Officer of the United States"" refers only to appointed officials, and it does not encompass elected individuals, such as the President or members of Congress. This is clear from the Commissions Clause, the Impeachment Clause, and the Appointments Clause, each of which uses ""officer of the United States"" to refer only to appointed and not elected officials. The second reason is that Section 3 cannot be used to exclude a presidential candidate from the ballot even if that candidate is disqualified from serving as president under Section 3 because Congress can lift that disability after the candidate is elected but before he takes office. A state cannot exclude any candidate for federal office from the ballot on account of Section 3, and any state that does so is violating the holding of Term Limits by altering the Constitution's qualifications for federal office. The Colorado Supreme Court's decision is no different from a state residency law that requires members of Congress to inhabit the state prior to Election Day, when the Constitution requires only that members of Congress inhabit the state that they represent when elected.

38062,2023.23-726-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Well, before we do that, can I just step back and get your understanding of the statute?  You made some representations as to how you see it working. And so let me tell you what I think, and then you can tell me whether you agree, disagree, or otherwise. So I think that there are two things that are plain, pretty plain, on the  -- the face of this st atute. One is that EMTALA is about the provision of stabilizing care for people who are experiencing emergency medical conditions. That's one thing I think the statute is doing. And I also think that it is operating to displace the prerogatives of hospitals or states or whomever with respect to that fairly narrow slice of the healthcare universe. This idea of emergency medical services is like one very minor part or small part of -- of the sort of overall healthcare -- provision of healthcare. So what that means is that when a hospital wants to only provide stabilizing care in emergencies for people who can pay for it, for example,  EMTALA says, no, I'm sorry, you have to stabilize anyone who's experiencing an emergency medical condition, or when a hospital wants to provide stabilizing treatments to people who are experiencing only certain kinds of emergency conditions, EMTALA says, no, here's the list of conditions and you have to provide stabilizing care for those people. Similarly, if a state says, look, it's our job to govern all of healthcare in our state and we say that only certain kinds of healthcare can be given to people who are experiencing emergency medical conditions, we don't want whatever treatment, we want only certain kinds of treatment, EMTALA says, no, we are directing that as a matter of federal law, when someone presents with an emergency condition, they have to be assessed and the hospital must do what is -- ever is in its capacity to stabilize them.

And as far as I understood your opening remarks, you say, well, this is left to the states. But, if I'm just looking at the statute, the statute tells you what the content of the stabilization requirement is. It's to provide such medical treatment as may be necessary to assure within reasonable probability that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to occur if the person were transferred or didn't get care. So it tells you very clearly it's an objective standard. It's basically it -- you know, it's a standard that clearly has reference to accepted medical practice, not just whatever one doctor happens to think. But it's here is the content of the standard.

38115,2023.23-726-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," General, are you aware of any other Spending Clause legislation that preempts criminal law?","<speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  EMTALA's promise is simple but profound. No one who comes to an emergency room in need of urgent treatment should be denied necessary stabilizing care. This case is about how that guarantee applies to pregnant women in medical crisis. In some tragic cases, women suffer emergency complications that make continuing their pregnancy a grave threat to their lives or their health. A woman whose amniotic sac has ruptured prematurely, for example, needs immediate treatment to avoid a serious risk of infection that could cascade into sepsis and the risk of hysterectomy. A woman with severe  preeclampsia can face a high risk of kidney failure that could require life-long dialysis. In cases like these, where there is no other way to stabilize the woman's medical condition and prevent her from deteriorating,  EMTALA's plain text requires that she be offered pregnancy termination as the necessary  treatment. And that's how this law has been understood and applied for decades. That usually poses no conflict with state law. Even states that have sharply restricted access to abortion after Dobbs generally allow exceptions to safeguard the mother's health. But Idaho makes termination a felony punishable by years of imprisonment unless it's necessary to prevent the woman's death. I think I understood my friend today to acknowledge several times that there is daylight between that standard and the necessary stabilizing treatment that EMTALA would require. And the Idaho Supreme Court recognized the same thing when it specifically contrasted the ""necessary to prevent death"" exception and said  it was materially narrower than a prior Idaho law that had a health exception that tracked EMTALA. The situation on the ground in Idaho is showing the devastating consequences of that gap. Today, doctors in Idaho and the women in Idaho are in an impossible position. If a woman  comes to an emergency room facing a grave threat to her health, but she isn't yet facing death, doctors either have to delay treatment and allow her condition to material -- to materially deteriorate, or they're airlifting her out of the state so she can get the emergency care that she needs. One hospital system in Idaho says that right now it's having to transfer pregnant women in medical crisis out of the state about once every other week. That's untenable, and EMTALA does not countenance it. None of Petitioners' interpretations fit with the text, and so they have tried to make this case be about the broader debate for access to abortion in cases of unwanted pregnancy. But that's not what this case is about at all.

Prelogar</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  EMTALA's promise is simple but profound. No one who comes to an emergency room in need of urgent treatment should be denied necessary stabilizing care. This case is about how that guarantee applies to pregnant women in medical crisis. In some tragic cases, women suffer emergency complications that make continuing their pregnancy a grave threat to their lives or their health. A woman whose amniotic sac has ruptured prematurely, for example, needs immediate treatment to avoid a serious risk of infection that could cascade into sepsis and the risk of hysterectomy. A woman with severe  preeclampsia can face a high risk of kidney failure that could require life-long dialysis. In cases like these, where there is no other way to stabilize the woman's medical condition and prevent her from deteriorating,  EMTALA's plain text requires that she be offered pregnancy termination as the necessary  treatment. And that's how this law has been understood and applied for decades. That usually poses no conflict with state law. Even states that have sharply restricted access to abortion after Dobbs generally allow exceptions to safeguard the mother's health. But Idaho makes termination a felony punishable by years of imprisonment unless it's necessary to prevent the woman's death. I think I understood my friend today to acknowledge several times that there is daylight between that standard and the necessary stabilizing treatment that EMTALA would require. And the Idaho Supreme Court recognized the same thing when it specifically contrasted the ""necessary to prevent death"" exception and said  it was materially narrower than a prior Idaho law that had a health exception that tracked EMTALA. The situation on the ground in Idaho is showing the devastating consequences of that gap. Today, doctors in Idaho and the women in Idaho are in an impossible position. If a woman  comes to an emergency room facing a grave threat to her health, but she isn't yet facing death, doctors either have to delay treatment and allow her condition to material -- to materially deteriorate, or they're airlifting her out of the state so she can get the emergency care that she needs. One hospital system in Idaho says that right now it's having to transfer pregnant women in medical crisis out of the state about once every other week. That's untenable, and EMTALA does not countenance it.

A woman with severe  preeclampsia can face a high risk of kidney failure that could require life-long dialysis. In cases like these, where there is no other way to stabilize the woman's medical condition and prevent her from deteriorating,  EMTALA's plain text requires that she be offered pregnancy termination as the necessary  treatment. And that's how this law has been understood and applied for decades. That usually poses no conflict with state law. Even states that have sharply restricted access to abortion after Dobbs generally allow exceptions to safeguard the mother's health. But Idaho makes termination a felony punishable by years of imprisonment unless it's necessary to prevent the woman's death. I think I understood my friend today to acknowledge several times that there is daylight between that standard and the necessary stabilizing treatment that EMTALA would require. And the Idaho Supreme Court recognized the same thing when it specifically contrasted the ""necessary to prevent death"" exception and said  it was materially narrower than a prior Idaho law that had a health exception that tracked EMTALA. The situation on the ground in Idaho is showing the devastating consequences of that gap. Today, doctors in Idaho and the women in Idaho are in an impossible position. If a woman  comes to an emergency room facing a grave threat to her health, but she isn't yet facing death, doctors either have to delay treatment and allow her condition to material -- to materially deteriorate, or they're airlifting her out of the state so she can get the emergency care that she needs. One hospital system in Idaho says that right now it's having to transfer pregnant women in medical crisis out of the state about once every other week. That's untenable, and EMTALA does not countenance it. None of Petitioners' interpretations fit with the text, and so they have tried to make this case be about the broader debate for access to abortion in cases of unwanted pregnancy. But that's not what this case is about at all. Idaho's ban on abortion is enforceable in virtually all of its applications, but in the narrow circumstances involving grave medical emergencies, Idaho  cannot criminalize the essential care that EMTALA requires.

Was he right?","<speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  EMTALA's promise is simple but profound. No one who comes to an emergency room in need of urgent treatment should be denied necessary stabilizing care. This case is about how that guarantee applies to pregnant women in medical crisis. In some tragic cases, women suffer emergency complications that make continuing their pregnancy a grave threat to their lives or their health. A woman whose amniotic sac has ruptured prematurely, for example, needs immediate treatment to avoid a serious risk of infection that could cascade into sepsis and the risk of hysterectomy. A woman with severe  preeclampsia can face a high risk of kidney failure that could require life-long dialysis. In cases like these, where there is no other way to stabilize the woman's medical condition and prevent her from deteriorating,  EMTALA's plain text requires that she be offered pregnancy termination as the necessary  treatment. And that's how this law has been understood and applied for decades. That usually poses no conflict with state law. Even states that have sharply restricted access to abortion after Dobbs generally allow exceptions to safeguard the mother's health. But Idaho makes termination a felony punishable by years of imprisonment unless it's necessary to prevent the woman's death. I think I understood my friend today to acknowledge several times that there is daylight between that standard and the necessary stabilizing treatment that EMTALA would require. And the Idaho Supreme Court recognized the same thing when it specifically contrasted the ""necessary to prevent death"" exception and said  it was materially narrower than a prior Idaho law that had a health exception that tracked EMTALA. The situation on the ground in Idaho is showing the devastating consequences of that gap. Today, doctors in Idaho and the women in Idaho are in an impossible position. If a woman  comes to an emergency room facing a grave threat to her health, but she isn't yet facing death, doctors either have to delay treatment and allow her condition to material -- to materially deteriorate, or they're airlifting her out of the state so she can get the emergency care that she needs. One hospital system in Idaho says that right now it's having to transfer pregnant women in medical crisis out of the state about once every other week. That's untenable, and EMTALA does not countenance it.

In some tragic cases, women suffer emergency complications that make continuing their pregnancy a grave threat to their lives or their health. A woman whose amniotic sac has ruptured prematurely, for example, needs immediate treatment to avoid a serious risk of infection that could cascade into sepsis and the risk of hysterectomy. A woman with severe  preeclampsia can face a high risk of kidney failure that could require life-long dialysis. In cases like these, where there is no other way to stabilize the woman's medical condition and prevent her from deteriorating,  EMTALA's plain text requires that she be offered pregnancy termination as the necessary  treatment. And that's how this law has been understood and applied for decades. That usually poses no conflict with state law. Even states that have sharply restricted access to abortion after Dobbs generally allow exceptions to safeguard the mother's health. But Idaho makes termination a felony punishable by years of imprisonment unless it's necessary to prevent the woman's death. I think I understood my friend today to acknowledge several times that there is daylight between that standard and the necessary stabilizing treatment that EMTALA would require. And the Idaho Supreme Court recognized the same thing when it specifically contrasted the ""necessary to prevent death"" exception and said  it was materially narrower than a prior Idaho law that had a health exception that tracked EMTALA. The situation on the ground in Idaho is showing the devastating consequences of that gap. Today, doctors in Idaho and the women in Idaho are in an impossible position. If a woman  comes to an emergency room facing a grave threat to her health, but she isn't yet facing death, doctors either have to delay treatment and allow her condition to material -- to materially deteriorate, or they're airlifting her out of the state so she can get the emergency care that she needs. One hospital system in Idaho says that right now it's having to transfer pregnant women in medical crisis out of the state about once every other week. That's untenable, and EMTALA does not countenance it. None of Petitioners' interpretations fit with the text, and so they have tried to make this case be about the broader debate for access to abortion in cases of unwanted pregnancy. But that's not what this case is about at all. Idaho's ban on abortion is enforceable in virtually all of its applications, but in the narrow circumstances involving grave medical emergencies, Idaho  cannot criminalize the essential care that EMTALA requires.

In some tragic cases, women suffer emergency complications that make continuing their pregnancy a grave threat to their lives or their health. A woman whose amniotic sac has ruptured prematurely, for example, needs immediate treatment to avoid a serious risk of infection that could cascade into sepsis and the risk of hysterectomy. A woman with severe  preeclampsia can face a high risk of kidney failure that could require life-long dialysis. In cases like these, where there is no other way to stabilize the woman's medical condition and prevent her from deteriorating,  EMTALA's plain text requires that she be offered pregnancy termination as the necessary  treatment. And that's how this law has been understood and applied for decades. That usually poses no conflict with state law. Even states that have sharply restricted access to abortion after Dobbs generally allow exceptions to safeguard the mother's health. But Idaho makes termination a felony punishable by years of imprisonment unless it's necessary to prevent the woman's death. I think I understood my friend today to acknowledge several times that there is daylight between that standard and the necessary stabilizing treatment that EMTALA would require. And the Idaho Supreme Court recognized the same thing when it specifically contrasted the ""necessary to prevent death"" exception and said  it was materially narrower than a prior Idaho law that had a health exception that tracked EMTALA. The situation on the ground in Idaho is showing the devastating consequences of that gap. Today, doctors in Idaho and the women in Idaho are in an impossible position. If a woman  comes to an emergency room facing a grave threat to her health, but she isn't yet facing death, doctors either have to delay treatment and allow her condition to material -- to materially deteriorate, or they're airlifting her out of the state so she can get the emergency care that she needs. One hospital system in Idaho says that right now it's having to transfer pregnant women in medical crisis out of the state about once every other week. That's untenable, and EMTALA does not countenance it. None of Petitioners' interpretations fit with the text, and so they have tried to make this case be about the broader debate for access to abortion in cases of unwanted pregnancy. But that's not what this case is about at all. Idaho's ban on abortion is enforceable in virtually all of its applications, but in the narrow circumstances involving grave medical emergencies, Idaho  cannot criminalize the essential care that EMTALA requires.

38362,2023.22-429-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"-- Ms. Corkran, can I give you another hypothetical that I hope will clarify things a little bit? So suppose we have an African American lawyer. This is back in the '60s, segregation time, '50s, '60s, who is across the street from a restaurant, and they see, they know, that the restaurant is not serving black customers through the front window, and at this time, the law says you're supposed to be, and they're not. They're making these people go around the back. And he's obviously upset about this. He feels the dignitary harm of seeing this happen. But he somehow disclaims that he ever would have gone to the restaurant, ever wanted to go to the restaurant, et cetera. Is it your view that he would have standing to sue because he's aware of, he sees, this discrimination occurring, but he's also said, I would never have subjected myself to that?","<speaker>Adam G.
