But even the Ninth Circuit realized how untenable that would be, so it created a novel, complicated, and ultimately unworkable law enforcement regime. The decision below replaces familiar Fourth Amendment standards codified in the Indian Civil Rights Act with an unprecedented standard that nobody is going to know how to apply, officers or courts. It will also force tribal officers to curtail otherwise reasonable policing activities when a suspect claims to be non-Indian or the officer isn't sure about Indian status or the status of the land that he's on.

Your friend on the other side says there's inherent authority and it hasn't been take -- the question is whether it's been taken away. He cites Colville. I understand your argument to be that, under Montana and subsequent cases interpreting it, there is no inherent authority. But even under Montana, there are exceptions, exceptions in which we've recognized that there is continuing inherent authority, and I wonder why the second exception doesn't apply here. That exception is when the conduct at issue threatens tribal self-governance, self-rule, which we've talked about in terms of political integrity, economic security, health and welfare. What could threaten that more than the idea that you can't do anything about somebody within the reservation that you have good reason to believe is violating criminal law?

Second, Congress addressed this issue by giving the Executive Branch broad authority to cross-deputize tribal officers to investigate and police federal crime in Indian country. Finally, no matter why the tribal officer in this case was not cross-deputized, that fact is not a basis to find inherent tribal police power over non-Indians. Instead, it is a basis to respect separation of powers and defer to Congress's plenary authority. The government disregards the unique and limited character of inherent tribal sovereignty. It not only asks this Court to find inherent tribal authority to regulate and police the conduct of non-Indians; it insists that tribes have unlimited authority to police all persons and to enforce all tribal, state, and federal laws governing Indian country. And the government claims this sweeping police authority over U.S. citizens is consistent with overriding federal interests, even though tribes exercise that authority outside the structure of the Constitution, free of political accountability, and cloaked with immunity from civil liability. The government's position is untenable. It ignores that tribal sovereignty is confined to managing tribal land, protecting tribal self-government, and controlling internal relations.

146,2020.19-1414-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Henkel. You make what I think are forceful separation-of-powers arguments, particularly that Congress has provided for cross-deputization, and that was not taken advantage of here. So I take that point, and that's an important one for me. But, at the same time, a couple other thoughts that I'll throw out there, and then you can react to them. The amicus brief from the former U.S. Attorneys says that ""criminal jurisdiction in Indian country is an indefensible morass of complex, conflicting, and illogical commands layered in over decades via congressional policies and court decisions and without the consent of tribal nations."" And I don't think you're going to disagree with that description necessarily, and so that leads me to think that one of the things we should be trying to do here is -- is to do no harm because there's lots of ripple effects from a broad decision. And with that in mind, there are statements in our decisions in Duro and Strate that really cut directly against you, as you're -- you're well aware. And you can say those are dicta, and that might be correct, but those have guided the law -- law enforcement for several decades. I think Congress and the executive could reasonably rely on those statements in the Court's decision. Certainly, the Cohen treatise treats those statements as authoritative in terms of guidance. So why isn't the best thing we can do here just to stick with what we said in those cases? It's not very analytically satisfying, but it's a narrow result. It does not make a morass, as it was described, any worse. What do you think?","<speaker>Eric R.

I mean, on the one hand, as Justice Kavanaugh points out, it's not very analytically satisfying to rely on the dicta, particularly from the footnote in Strate. But I want to try this on -- you know, you say one problem with our -- you know, or the government's approach or an approach saying that there is some sort of retained authority to police here is that we haven't identified its scope or its source. But, you know, Montana and those cases that followed it relied pretty heavily on the unfairness of imposing tribal law on those who didn't participate in its creation. And in that respect, Strate's footnote is perfectly consistent with that because, as the United States pointed out in argument and in its brief, you know, Cooley and -- and other non-members of the tribe are represented in the creation of federal law. And so it doesn't pose that same problem here. It's -- it's far less of an unfairness, and Strate's footnote can be seen to be consistent with that principle, particularly if the United States is right that one way to understand Montana is that that is an instance of implied preemption that cashes out when you consider the assertion of authority to adjudicate finally civil or criminal liability or the imposition of regulations on those who didn't participate in its exercise.

Back when this one was passed, we had a pretty free-wheeling approach. You know, we weren't as confined to the specific language. You sort of looked at what Congress had in mind and -- and figured out the meaning in light of that. And, of course, today, we have a more disciplined approach, you know, I think more suited to our role under the Constitution. But shouldn't we construe this statute in the environment in which Congress passed it in light of the, as I said, more free-wheeling approach? And I think there'd be a lot more leeway to your friend on the other side argument about an expansive reading of some of the language.

First, 13(b) is limited to cases where someone is violating or is about to violate the Act. That limit to ongoing or imminent violations would make no sense if 13(b) authorized retrospective monetary relief for past harms. Second, where the Act allows relief beyond injunctions, it says so. Section 5(l) authorizes an injunction and further equitable relief as appropriate. That language would have been pointless if the word ""injunction"" itself implied all equitable relief.

I want to pick up on Justice Alito's question and Mr. FitzGerald's article, which I've read. You obviously put forward good arguments on Porter and the Court's precedent and Congress's intent, as well as the body of court of appeals cases, but it seems that the problem you have is the text. And in that sense, this case really is a separation of powers case. I -- I -- I worked in the Executive Branch for many years, so I understand how this happens. When you're in the Executive Branch or an independent agency, you want to do good things and prevent or punish bad things, and sometimes your statutory authority is borderline. And it could be war policy or immigration or environmental or what have you, but with good intentions, the agency pushes the envelope and stretches the statutory language to do the good or prevent the bad. The problem is -- is it results in a transfer of power from Congress to the Executive Branch to decide whether to exercise this new authority. That's a particular concern, at least for me, with independent agencies. So -- now why isn't the answer here, for the agency to seek this new authority from Congress, for us to maintain the principle that separation of powers, that the agency should stick to the authority in the -- in the text and not -- and not go beyond that?

You're seeming to assume that the numbers of cases in which this is useful has to be dramatically large because charities are dramatically largely committing fraud. What if I disagree with you, number one? Number two, the interest that California has in this schedule is, in part -- there was testimony by the head of the charitable organizations and by the investigating -- auditing team that if you give out a subpoena or an audit letter, that it tips off -- and there has been history of these letters tipping off -- fraudsters and then hiding -- and then hiding their illegality. So the audit -- this -- this disclosure saves some time because audit and subpoena letters take them a long time to get the information.

The conservator eliminated any risk that the cycle could continue where the enterprises' obligations to Treasury would themselves cause draws from Treasury's capital commitment. The shareholders' statutory and constitutional challenges to the Third Amendment fail for many reasons, but there are three key defects that I'll try to address today. First, both claims are barred by the Recovery Act's succession clause, which transfers to the conservator the authority to decide whether shareholders may bring derivative suits on behalf of the enterprises. The type of shareholder injury alleged here, that the corporations' assets have been unlawfully dissipated to a particular shareholder, is plainly derivative rather than direct. The shareholders have not cited even a single case to the contrary. Second, the statutory claim is barred by the Recovery Act's anti-injunction clause, which prevents courts from restraining exercises of the conservator's powers or functions. The conservator acted well within its authority in deciding that the renegotiation of the enterprises' financial obligations may have been appropriate to preserve and conserve Treasury's capital commitment. The shareholders cannot second-guess the wisdom or motives behind that business judgment. Third, the constitutional claim fails because President Obama had unrestricted power to remove and thus to supervise both of the officials who signed the Third Amendment. Treasury Secretary Geithner was, of course, removable at will, and so too was Acting FHFA Director DeMarco.

They've suffered a pocketbook injury. You haven't contended, I don't think, that they're not within the zone of interest of the statute.

If the Court chooses to tackle the harder question, it should still reverse. First, for the reasons this Court gave in Seila Law, the FHFA does not wield significant executive power because it does not regulate purely private actors. Even the Department of Justice concedes that conservatorship is not an exercise of executive power. By itself, this is another reason to reverse. Regardless, neither party undermines Seila Law's observation that the FHFA isn't in the same league as the CFPB when it comes to liberty.

5699,2020.19-422-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch,"Good morning, Mr. Nielson. A -- a lot of your remedial argument seems to hinge on the happenstance that we had an acting director at the time of the Third Amendment's adoption. I -- I'd like to highlight two potential difficulties with that and ask for your thoughts. The first is the assumption that the acting director is answerable to the President while the director is not. Under the statute creating this outfit, the director appoints deputy directors, the director, not the President. It appears that those deputy directors would be insulated from the President therefore. And when -- when the director steps aside, he names the acting director, or, rather, he gives a pool of three of his deputies and the President chooses which of those three. But the director appointed all three of them. So I'm not sure in what sense or where we get the inference or how we generate from some penumbra emanating somewhere that the President has the removal power over this acting director. That's one. And two is, let's -- let's box in that, let's assume that's the case. So what?

You say, well, that -- that -- that doesn't matter because the amendment is a thing that was adopted by the acting director.

The Court should hold that unless Congress says so in a statute, an acting director does not have tenure full stop. I agree with the Solicitor General on this in all respects but one. Because an acting director is removable at will, this part of the case should be over. As the United States explained below, plaintiffs do not, in fact, challenge ongoing action by the FHFA. That, rather than the government's latest position, is correct. I urge the Court to read J.A. 117. There is no reference to any prospective suit or anything like that in the complaint here. If the Court chooses to tackle the harder question, it should still reverse. First, for the reasons this Court gave in Seila Law, the FHFA does not wield significant executive power because it does not regulate purely private actors. Even the Department of Justice concedes that conservatorship is not an exercise of executive power. By itself, this is another reason to reverse. Regardless, neither party undermines Seila Law's observation that the FHFA isn't in the same league as the CFPB when it comes to liberty. Second, the Court should focus on the actual text of the statute, which the parties essentially ignored. Neither party meaningfully disputes that for cause provides the weakest protection in removal law and can easily be read to allow removal based on policy disagreement with the President. The parties say that even that is unconstitutional. But their argument makes a hash out of the take care clause, and it would also have far-reaching consequences. Under their logic, the Social Security Administration, the Office of Special Counsel, the Federal Reserve, the civil service, will all be subject to constitutional attack, and that's just the beginning.

The conservator acted well within its authority in deciding that the renegotiation of the enterprises' financial obligations may have been appropriate to preserve and conserve Treasury's capital commitment. The shareholders cannot second-guess the wisdom or motives behind that business judgment. Third, the constitutional claim fails because President Obama had unrestricted power to remove and thus to supervise both of the officials who signed the Third Amendment. Treasury Secretary Geithner was, of course, removable at will, and so too was Acting FHFA Director DeMarco. Thus, while the statutory restriction on the President's power to remove the FHFA director is invalid, it had no prejudicial effect on the Third Amendment. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2020,coherent

The government cannot cross that line without a warrant, unless there is consent or exigent circumstances. Here, there was neither. Respondents' warrantless seizure of Petitioner from his home and their subsequent seizures of his lawfully possessed guns from his bedroom and garage violated the Fourth Amendment. The First Circuit tried to get around the warrant requirement by creating a new exception based on Cady. But Cady involved the standardized search of a car in police custody. It doesn't grant a license for intruding the home. Quite the opposite, nearly every page of the Court's decision relies on the constitutional differences between cars and houses. Respondents and the United States take a different tack. They claim that the warrant requirement isn't even implicated when officers act for non-investigatory reasons. But, in case after case, the Court has consistently applied the warrant requirement to homes, regardless of the government's purpose, including when public health or safety is at stake. Moreover, the line between investigatory and non-investigatory actions is hardly clear. Nearly every criminal violation has public safety implications, so dispensing with the warrant requirement whenever police can point to a health or safety motive would eviscerate the Fourth Amendment. Finally, there's no good reason to create the sweeping new rule that Respondents ask for. Where there is a true emergency or where people ask to be helped, existing law already allows an exception to the warrant requirement. Many states also provide a number of ways for the government to address problems while respecting the Fourth Amendment, including red flag laws and involuntary commitment procedures.

The government cannot cross that line without a warrant, unless there is consent or exigent circumstances. Here, there was neither. Respondents' warrantless seizure of Petitioner from his home and their subsequent seizures of his lawfully possessed guns from his bedroom and garage violated the Fourth Amendment.

It doesn't grant a license for intruding the home. Quite the opposite, nearly every page of the Court's decision relies on the constitutional differences between cars and houses. Respondents and the United States take a different tack. They claim that the warrant requirement isn't even implicated when officers act for non-investigatory reasons. But, in case after case, the Court has consistently applied the warrant requirement to homes, regardless of the government's purpose, including when public health or safety is at stake. Moreover, the line between investigatory and non-investigatory actions is hardly clear. Nearly every criminal violation has public safety implications, so dispensing with the warrant requirement whenever police can point to a health or safety motive would eviscerate the Fourth Amendment. Finally, there's no good reason to create the sweeping new rule that Respondents ask for. Where there is a true emergency or where people ask to be helped, existing law already allows an exception to the warrant requirement.

But I am concerned deeply about the First Circuit's claim that there is no requirement that officers must select the least intrusive means of fulfilling care -- community caretaking responsibilities. I think what everyone has forgotten here is that, at least in this situation, there was no immediate danger to the person threatening suicide and no immediate danger to the wife because the suicide person was removed to a hospital. And so the issue is, can the police, notwithstanding that and notwithstanding the ability to ask the wife whether she would consent to giving up the gun and ammunition, that they decided on their own to go in and seize the gun. That appears to me to take away from any of the limiting principles that Justice Alito put forth, yes, some -- some -- whether you call it reasonable suspicion, some -- some suspicion, whatever adjective you put there, there was no immediate danger, there were a readily accessible alternative that was ignored, and you're putting into the hands of law enforcement the ability to use their judgment as opposed to that of the psychiatrists who were treating this man, they certainly could have asked the psychiatrists whether they should remove the guns or not.

Respondents and the United States take a different tack. They claim that the warrant requirement isn't even implicated when officers act for non-investigatory reasons.

Moreover, the line between investigatory and non-investigatory actions is hardly clear.

6188,2020.20-157-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, one of the reasons I think the Fourth Amendment was there was to make persons -- and I'm quoting its own language roughly -- to secure persons in their home. That's the language of the Fourth Amendment. And it seems to me that I don't have a problem with them having removed this gentleman and taken him to the hospital. That's a seizure, because they had reason to believe that he was threatening suicide. And even though 12 hours had passed, the wife was still concerned, and he admitted to the threat by calling it a joke. I don't think police officers have to take his description at face value given the circumstances described. So seizing him and taking him to the home would seem to me -- to psychiatric examination as very much an exigent circumstance. Missing here, as I pointed out to your colleague, is the next step, which is going into the home without attempt to secure consent from the wife and seizing the gun and then keeping it indefinitely until a lawsuit is filed. The wife tried to get it back. He tried to get it back. Weeks and weeks went by. When we permit police to search and seize without some standard, we run the risk of situations like this one repeating themselves. So can you concentrate on the exigency with respect to the second seizure at issue?

Instead, the settled understanding for the last 45 years has been that ANCs are eligible to be treated as Indian Tribes for ISDA purposes, even though ANCs are not and have never been federally recognized Indian Tribes.

So you -- you told several of my colleagues that the recognition clause -- that one way to understand it is that it's a term of art but that it has a -- well, that you could take its ordinary meaning, simply, you know, an entity that contracts with the federal government for services that are designed to go to Indians because of their status as Indians. And you said, well, sure, you can look at this, and I understand it's your backup argument, but you can understand it in its ordinary meaning as the other Petitioner advocates for. Now you say but a lesser-included definition would be the term-of-art recognition definition like we see in the later-passed List Act. I don't really see how you can have a -- a lesser included specialized definition. It seems to me either it's ordinary meaning or it's not. And, you know, you're kind of cagey in your brief and I think a little bit at oral argument too about whether, in fact, that eligibility clause refers to FRT status. So which is it?

Clement</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Nearly everything about Alaska is different, including its native entities. Congress established ANCs in the Settlement Act as native entities unlike lower 48 tribes. ANCs have never been sovereign, but they have always played a critical role in distributing special federal Indian benefits to Alaska natives. Congress specifically added ANCs to ISDEAA's definition of ""Indian Tribes."" Respondents, however, contend that Congress accomplished nothing because ANCs do not satisfy the eligibility clause. But, if that clause is only given its ordinary meaning, ANCs plainly satisfy it. Congress said ""recognized as eligible,"" not ""recognized as sovereigns,"" and ANCs have long been recognized as eligible for special federal Indian benefits starting with the Settlement Act. If, instead, the phrase is given a term-of-art meaning restricted to sovereign tribes, then it is wholly inapplicable to entities established by Congress as alternatives to sovereign tribes. Either reading is vastly preferable to one that would defeat the ANCs' specific inclusion in the definition.</text>",2020,Coherent

What we're talking about is the text, and the text says in the list ANCs. And then the text takes away eligibility.

I would take that to mean that because of Alaska's unusual, indeed, very distinct method of handling benefits to native Americans, that that amendment to ANCSA makes clear that that trust relationship exists even though they don't enroll in tribes. Am I wrong about that?","<speaker>Matthew Guarnieri</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our fundamental submission in this case is that in defining ""Indian Tribe"" for ISDA purposes, Congress did not deliberately include Alaska native regional and village corporations only to then exclude all of them by subjecting them to a formal political recognition requirement that no ANC meets or, indeed, has ever met. Instead, the settled understanding for the last 45 years has been that ANCs are eligible to be treated as Indian Tribes for ISDA purposes, even though ANCs are not and have never been federally recognized Indian Tribes. That interpretation has been endorsed by all three branches of the federal government. Congress was acting against the backdrop of those settled understandings when it incorporated the ISDA definition of ""Indian Tribe"" into the CARES Act in 2020. Congress chose to make ANCs eligible to receive millions of dollars of coronavirus relief funds to benefit the many Alaska natives whom they serve. The decision below contravenes that policy judgment and threatens to shut ANCs out of a wide range of important federal programs. No sound principle of textual interpretation justifies such a dramatic departure from the status quo. Reading the ISDA definition to mean that ANCs are included only in the event that they are someday somehow recognized by the United States for government-to-government relations would render their deliberate inclusion in the statute a dead letter. Either the recognition clause must mean something else, or it does not apply to ANCs. Now we principally urge the latter approach, which the Department of the Interior and the Indian Health Service adopted decades ago and which the Ninth Circuit endorsed in the Cook Inlet case. In our view, Congress defined the entities eligible to enter into ISDA agreements as federally recognized Indian Tribes and also, in addition, the entities that play a similar role in the special case of Alaska, namely, Alaska native villages and Alaska native corporations defined in and established pursuant to ANCSA.

It has to -- it has to involve a chase. The person, the arrestee, must actually be trying to flee and avoid arrest, and that makes it -- it -- there are justifications for such a doctrine because, when an arrestee is chased and flees into his house, there are strong reasons across the board for not waiting for a warrant. There's a heightened risk that this person is going to sneak away before the house can be surrounded. One of the briefs says it takes six to eight officers to surround the house waiting for a warrant. There's a heightened risk that evidence is going to be destroyed, a heightened risk that the person is going to barricade himself in the house, get a gun, and resist the execution of a warrant. Here, the -- the video shows there was no chase and Mr. Lange really didn't flee, and all that the court below held was that a reasonable person in his position would have known that the officer was trying to stop him. That -- after viewing the video, even that seems to me dubious. And if you take into account Mr. Lange's blood alcohol content, it's even more questionable.

6648,2020.20-18-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, I've been listening to the exchange with my colleagues involving the difficulty in deciding what's a felony and what's a misdemeanor. Part of the problem is that what are felonies are no longer absolutely, necessarily, and in all situations dangerous crimes. You can have white-collar crimes where there is no danger. You can have all sorts of environmental crimes, other things that don't cause -- that don't create exigency in the same sense that Santana was announcing the rule or that the common law came from. And so I don't know why anybody is arguing that there's a difference between felony and misdemeanors and why we're recognizing a categorical rule at all. Why isn't the better reading just that hot pursuit is a type of exigent circumstance that can but does not always justify warrantless entry, regardless of whether the underlying offense is a felony or misdemeanor? If you look at our holding in Santana, we talked about all of the circumstances that would make it likely that a drug dealer would destroy evidence once they saw the police officer on -- on the scene. Our next case, Stanton, was not about whether or not the issue was a felony or not. It was -- the issue was, was the situation such as to justify, reasonably, entry? So I guess what I'm asking is, why don't we just announce the rule that I stated, that exigency can but doesn't always, whether it's a misdemeanor or a felony, justify a warrantless entry?","<speaker>Samuel T.

First, Justice Breyer points out that different states have different rules about what a felony is and what a misdemeanor is, and it would seem odd that the Constitution would -- in its meaning, would depend upon the happenstance of positive state law. And, second, we live in a world in which everything has been criminalized. And some professors have even opined that there's not an American alive who hasn't committed a felony in some -- under some state law. And in a world like that, why does it make sense to retreat back to the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment, which I'm going to oversimplify but generally says that you get to go into a home without a warrant if the officer sees a -- a -- a violent action or something that's likely to be -- lead to imminent violence?

Women driving alone are sometimes afraid to stark on -- stop on dark roads and occasionally are not even sure those following them are police officers.

How can I -- how can we ignore that teaching of the common law? And I guess I go back to Justice Gorsuch's point that perhaps we should just hew to the common law more strictly and recognize exceptions only that reflect the teachings of the common law, so exigent circumstances, hot pursuit for serious offenses that themselves, like the Solicitor General suggests, suggest a basis for entry or a need for entry.

Roberts, Jr.","Counsel, what do you do with the language in Mendoza-Lopez, ""There is no congressional intent to sanction challenges to deportation orders in proceedings under 1326""?","<speaker>Bradley N. Garcia</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This indictment was properly dismissed for two reasons. First, a Section 1326 prosecution cannot proceed based on an invalid removal order. And this case can be resolved on the narrow ground that the invalidity of the order here is undisputed. This invalidity point flows not just from constitutional and background principles but directly from the plain text of subsection (d). That provision sets forth a way to ""challenge the validity of the deportation order."" That language necessarily assumes that the order on which a Section 1326 charge is based must be valid. Otherwise, satisfying subsection (d)'s three requirements would have no effect. The order would be deemed invalid, but there would be no consequence. The government admits as much on page 9 of its reply brief, explaining that invalidity of the order is a defense to the charge. And once it's clear that, if the order is invalid, the charge cannot proceed, the proper result here is also clear. This order is indisputably invalid. Leocal established that before this proceeding ever began, and the government has never claimed otherwise. The government's only response to this argument is that subsection (d) requires any defendant who challenges the validity of a removal order to make the provision's three showings. But there is no need to challenge the validity of a removal -- removal order where, as here, it is already undisputed the order is invalid. Instead, the order's undisputed invalidity requires dismissal without having to go through subsection (d)'s three prongs. Second, even if those three prongs governed here, they are satisfied. Administrative remedies were not available because no ordinary non-citizen could understand and formulate the complex legal arguments required to challenge BIA precedent under the categorical approach. The government's contrary reading would not even cover the facts of Mendoza-Lopez or any case in the 25 years since this statute was amended. I welcome your questions.</text>",2020,coherent

Let me -- let me go back to Justice Kagan's question. So she pointed out that another way to satisfy this rule would be to send essentially what would be a draft notice containing all information except time and place the first time around, and then later, once the time and place was set, send the notice that would actually trigger the stop-time rule that contained all the information.

That's squarely contrary to assignor estoppel. In 1947, in Katzinger, this Court confirmed that Scott Paper meant an assignor was free to challenge the validity of a patent. And Lear, looking back on the state of the law before 1952, said that this Court had by then undermined the very basis of any general rule of patent estoppel. The logic of this Court's decisions require abandoning assignor estoppel. Exposing bad patents is vital patent law policy, and allowing assignors to do so carries no meaningful costs. No reliance interests stand in the way of eliminating this anomalous doctrine. And a patent-law-specific limitation on the rights of assignors is nothing like claim preclusion or issue preclusion or even equitable estoppel, which are generally applicable rules woven into our basic notions of fair and efficient litigation. At the very least, an inventor should be allowed to show that the assignee is asserting a claim broader than what the inventor adequately described and enabled. Not even estoppel by deed, assignor estoppel's supposed model, supports preventing challenges that appear on the face of the patent. And when, as here, the assignee, not the assignor, prosecuted the relevant claim nine years after the patent rights were sold and did so to prevent competition from the assignor's new improved device, assignor estoppel is particularly at odds with patent law policy. This Court should order the Federal Circuit to consider Minerva's Section 112 invalidity argument on the merits. Be happy to take any questions.</text>",2020,coherent

And so I -- I guess my first question is, why doesn't it face the same stare decisis challenges that the Petitioner has? So that's one set of questions for you. Second is, with respect to the -- the choice of relying on estoppel by deed and the analogy to physical property, it allows -- your test would allow liability even when there's no misrepresentation of fact and the buyer, often in these cases large and sophisticated, more so than the seller, could easily determine the validity of the patent on its own and is better positioned to do so. And you also get rid of reliance. And I guess I don't understand why we would impose liability on statements that even you'd agree were utterly meaningless at the time. And all that points to my third question, and then I'll stop, and that is, if we're going to look at estoppel doctrine, I -- I -- I guess I'm a little confused why we would look to real -- physical real estate as the example, where deeds, recorded deeds, have a special role in our -- in our system and have a special validity, rather than personal -- personal property, where these elements, misrepresentation of facts and -- and reliance, are required, given that patents are so easily killable and challengeable in ways that physical real estate, much harder to do so.

Not even estoppel by deed, assignor estoppel's supposed model, supports preventing challenges that appear on the face of the patent.

That's -- that's a serious question here about whether there were enough allegations that the acts of this corporation had a sufficient tie to the United States. I put that argument aside. But we know that under the ATS the first Congress wanted the ATS to cover piracy. We also know that those who provided assistance to pirates were themselves held liable, whether they committed it on land or the sea, as aiders and abetters. And it boggles my mind to think that the aiding and abetting had to have happened on the sea and not on the land because the first -- 1799 imposed criminal liability for wherever the assistance occurred. And so my difficulty is, in understanding your answer, why it is that the ATS would not have seen aiding and abetting as its own form of criminal liability and the issue being whether there were enough ties to the jurisdiction in which it occurred.

The claim plaintiffs bring alleges something horrific, that locators in Mali sold them as children to an Ivorian farm where overseers forced them to work. The defendants are not the locators, not the overseers, and not the farm. Instead, they are two U.S. corporations, Nestle USA and Cargill. The plaintiffs do not allege that these two owned or operated any farm, and they do not allege that the companies bought anything from farms that used child labor. Instead, the companies are an afterthought, a few of 101 paragraphs in their complaint. They claim the companies made decisions in the U.S. and that they had knowledge of child slavery. This lawsuit fails for two independent reasons. First, it's extraterritorial. You've said, when a statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it has none. Here, the plaintiffs haven't alleged any domestic injury or even that they've been to the U.S. History and this Court's cases make clear that the ATS's focus is the injury or principal wrongdoing from a tort. Here, that occurred halfway across the globe. And, second, the ATS is about natural persons. Jesner recognized there is no specific universal and obligatory international law norm of corporate liability that fully applies to domestic corporations. It's not enough, as the Jesner plurality said, to show ""liability might be permissible under international law"" in some circumstances. Rather, it must be, to use Sosa's language, ""accepted by the civilized world and defined with a specificity comparable to the features of the 18th century paradigm.""

The defendants are not the locators, not the overseers, and not the farm. Instead, they are two U.S. corporations, Nestle USA and Cargill.

Keisler</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The statute establishing the Renewable Fuel Standard exempted all small refineries from its requirements for the first years of the program and authorizes them individually to seek extensions of that exemption at any time based on hardship.

If there's even one year in which it can comply without hardship, it's then disqualified for all future years. Nothing in the statute's text imposes this unique prohibition. Respondents' argument rests on the word ""extension,"" which they contend should be read temporally here to mean an increase in a length of time.

A continuity requirement would also be contrary to this statute's purposes. The statutory design is to impose burdens that escalate dramatically over time.

Mr. Keisler's second argument in his brief, which is his lead argument today, the argument that the extension, the word ""extension"" is temporal but does not have to be continuous, just to set up how I'm thinking about this and then get your response, you know, you -- you admit it's not an unambiguous word. I think Congress uses ""extension"" sometimes even when something's lapsed. We have the examples -- COVID and other examples. You make a big deal about ordinary usage, but I'll give you three instances in my life where ordinary usage goes the other way from what you -- what you say. So sometimes one that you're teaching and you have a 5:00 p.m. due date for a paper, you know, after the due date, you will get an e-mail entitled Extension Request, you grant a paper extension afterwards. Or when a -- you use a sports contract example in your brief, but oftentimes, if the contract ends at the end of the season, in the off-season, the player signs a new contract. That will be described by most people as player extends for two more years. Or, if you let your print newspaper subscription lapse for a time and then you start it up again, you'll tell your family member or friend, oh, I extended the paper subscription. So I -- I think ordinary usage also, like congressional usage, in my experience at least doesn't tell us exactly. So how do we break this? And the two things he emphasizes are ""at any time"" and that that's -- there's no sunset date. So I want to get your responses to that. And then also on the purpose and context, if we get to that, to help break what -- I don't want to say tie, but to figure out what Congress was thinking about with the word or what it was doing with the word ""extension,"" your position is that Congress wanted small fine -- refineries to have no outlet at all, to essentially go out of business, whereas the other side's position is simply that EPA would have authority, as a matter of separation of powers, authority to grant an exemption if a small refinery had -- had a -- had a problem, and it really seems quite implausible to think Congress wanted refineries in that circumstance to go out of business.

That finding, which is overwhelmingly refuted by the evidence, corrupted his entire analysis. The Special Master relied on the supposed absence of harm in concluding that Georgia's consumption was reasonable. He relied on the absence of harm in concluding that Florida would not benefit from a decree.

Those findings alone compel the conclusion that Georgia's unrestrained consumption is unreasonable. Under the balancing called for by this Court, the evidence overwhelmingly establishes that Florida would significantly benefit from a decree and that meaningful relief is available for little or even no cost to Georgia. In fact, hundreds of additional CFS inflows could be generated at zero cost simply by halting illegal irrigation, eliminating overwatering, and scheduling irrigation to maximize its impact. That water in itself could prevent the extreme low flow conditions that decimated the Apalachicola in 2012, a huge benefit.

14669,2020.142-orig-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett,"Good morning, Mr. Garre. I have a question about what showing you're required to make at this stage about the Corps' -- what role the Corps would have in ensuring that extra water went to Florida even assuming that we impose this cap of 1,000 cubic feet per second. I mean, last time around, the Court said that the Special Master had required too much and too soon, essentially, from you with respect to the proof of what the Corps would do. Specifically, what more have you shown this time around? Because now the other findings that Special Master Lancaster did not make have been made. So have you done anything additional to show what the Corps could do to accommodate?","<speaker>Gregory G. Garre</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The last time this case was here, the Court remanded for the Special Master to conduct an equitable balancing inquiry, but, on remand, the Special Master immediately short-circuited that inquiry by finding that Florida has not been harmed at all as a result of Georgia's exploding irrigation use along the Flint River. That finding, which is overwhelmingly refuted by the evidence, corrupted his entire analysis. The Special Master relied on the supposed absence of harm in concluding that Georgia's consumption was reasonable. He relied on the absence of harm in concluding that Florida would not benefit from a decree. And he relied on the absence of harm in refusing even to order Georgia to stop irrigating on permitted acreage. And yet, despite getting off track, even Special Master Kelly found that Georgia's consumption only increases in drought periods, when water matters most, that Georgia has not effectively curbed this use, and that there's no doubt that extreme low flows have occurred much more frequently in recent times. Those findings alone compel the conclusion that Georgia's unrestrained consumption is unreasonable.

I'm -- I'm just not sure how we can ignore the fact that there are measures that would not be costly that would only require that you do something about your grandfathered permits so that there are limits put in and limits that are related to need rather than open-ended. Why should we ignore that those conservation methods would come at no cost?","<speaker>Craig S.
