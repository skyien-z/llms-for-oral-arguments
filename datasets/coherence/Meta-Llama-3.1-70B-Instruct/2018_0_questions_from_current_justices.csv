1962,2018.18-431-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch,"Mr. Feigin, looking at the language of (c)(3), the word ""offense"" is in a prefatory clause before (A) and (B). And as I understand the government's position, (A), we will continue to read ""offense"" to mean the offense charged on the books and look at the elements. But, with respect to (B), you'd like us to look at the facts and treat the word ""offense"" there to mean what did the defendant actually do. We don't normally read prefatory language to mean two different things in two clauses that follow. And, in fact, the government earlier this year in -- I -- I don't know how to pronounce it, Cochise, I think it is, argued precisely this point, that normally a single word is given a single construction, at least throughout the same paragraph.

And I guess I want to do it by comparing it to this bill that's currently pending in Congress which is meant to change this provision in order to make it fact-specific. And so this bill, rather than says -- rather than saying an -- an -- an offense that by its nature involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used, instead says an offense that by -- excuse me, an offense that based on the facts underlying the offense -- so they substitute ""by its nature"" for ""based on the facts underlying the offense"" -- and then they change the tense and they say involved a substantial risk that force may have been used, right? So ""by its nature"" versus ""based on the facts"" and changing the tense to make it clear that what we're looking at is something that has occurred and that we're able, actually, to make a fact-specific determination about it. Now that's the way you would write a provision of the kind that you want. This is not the way you would write a provision of the kind that you want. ""By its nature"" clearly is like, what is this offense ordinarily about? And then the use of the present tense is -- is inconsistent with this notion that the jury in this case is having to look back to determine the particular facts of a particular crime.","<speaker>Eric J.

This is the understanding that controls in takings cases against the United States under the Tucker Act, and there's no reason why we should have a different constitutional interpretation of the Just Compensation Clause simply because the defendant is a local government entity. But, in fact, Williamson County does adopt a conflicting and anomalous and mistaken interpretation of the Just Compensation Clause in holding that an invasion of property is not without compensation and not actionable under the Takings Clause until state remedies are exhausted. A basis for this understanding is this Court's decision -- the initial basis is the Great Falls Manufacturing case. This is 1884. And in that case, this Court said that when a property owner has their property invaded, they are entitled from that moment to go seek compensation on a constitutional basis.

Number two, when we're looking at stare decisis, this is an alternative holding. It isn't well reasoned. It's very briefly provided.

And as many justices have just recognized, at all times, the United States maintains ultimate control over the suit and it is the ultimate beneficiary of the suit. Approximately 70 percent of qui tam suits are initiated by private relators. The Department of Justice intervenes in only about a fifth of those. But, in every case where the result is successful, either by settlement or by judgment, the United States is the ultimate beneficiary. In every case, the United States gets at least 70 percent of the proceeds. And this is in keeping with the entire rational purpose of the statute, which, as a number of the Court members have noted, is the only reason to deviate from the plain language of the statute.</text>",2018,incoherent

Suppose that you manufacture a drug and there's some evidence, whether it's enough, hard to know, but there's some evidence that it causes ovarian cancer, and you, the drug manufacturer, proposes a warning to the FDA, but instead of saying that the drug causes ovarian cancer, you say it causes ovarian cysts.

May not be clearly related to the atypical -- forget that word -- fractures that have been reported in the literature. Discussion of the risk factors for stress fractures is not warranted and is not adequately supported by the available literature. Nowhere did they say that the atypical fractures are not supported by the literature, and nowhere did they say don't change it.

If the FDA told Merck that, then it's impossible. But, if the FDA didn't tell Merck that, whatever is in the FDA's head, if the FDA didn't tell Merck that, then it's not impossible for Merck to change its label, and it has responsibility over its label, and to the extent that it thinks that the literature supports a change, it should change its label.","<speaker>Malcolm L.

The first is that, in October of 2010, when the FDA ultimately decided that an addition to the warnings and precautions section of these labels was warranted, it rejected Merck's proposal that the warning include repeated uses of the term ""stress fracture"". And FDA did express at that time the concern that practitioners, for whom that term usually connoted a relatively minor event, might read it as understating the seriousness of the potential health risk of Fosamax. That potential type of confusion needs to be distinguished from the question, was FDA confused by Merck's submission as a whole? And there's no reason to think that that was so. At page 670 of the Joint Appendix, Merck kind of, in the introductory section of its proposal, summarizes what it's -- the warning that it's proposing to add, and it says at the very top of the page: Merck is proposing to add language to both the precaution and adverse reaction post-marketing experience section of the label to describe low-energy fractures that have been reported, of which some have been stress insufficiency at the subtrochanteric region of the femoral shaft.

It said, in deciding whether counsel is ineffective, first you determine whether a defendant would have appealed. And it said there's two ways to make that determination. A, was there a plea waiver? If yes, then he wouldn't have appealed. Or, second, did he tell the attorney he wanted to appeal? And this is the second of those. But I can't square your position with Flores-Ortega because Flores-Ortega seemed to accept as a working proposition that given that there is even, in a guilty plea, there are waivers of some issues but not others, that the question of whether a defendant would have appealed takes into account the plea waiver at that stage, but once a defendant tells an attorney to appeal, that's his choice.

Second, it's not true that Congress wanted to detain and deport all criminal aliens, as the government claims in its reply brief at page 12. And, three, if Congress really wanted what the executive branch claims here, it would have simply written a statute that says people in these four categories shall be detained without a hearing until removed. That is not what Congress did. Instead, Congress wrote a statute, 1226(c), as an exception to the general detention scheme in 1226(a) which applies except as provided in subsection (c), not as except -- not except as provided in section (c)(2), as the government would have it. Congress wrote section 1226(c) in two paragraphs. The first paragraph says who gets taken into custody and when, and the second paragraph says of those people in paragraph (1) who can be released.

It said except -- as an alien described in paragraph (1), not an alien described in paragraph (1)(A) through (D). And the government's reading, trying to pull section (2), (c)(2), out as that free-standing authorization, leads to three serious anomalies that they struggle to explain, as they did with you, Justice Kagan. The first anomaly is, as you noted, that the transition rules, which were meant to be a ramp-up to the permanent rule, are completely superfluous. If the government really could delay, for whatever reason, picking up people subject to mandatory detention for as long as it needs or wants, then Congress would not need to have that intermediate step. The second anomaly with the government's reading is -- and the government struggled with this in response, again, to your questions, Justice Kagan -- is that if the only qualification to be subject to mandatory detention is that you fall into one of the four categories in A through D, they necessarily read out the prior criminal custody requirement. In -- in addition to the example you gave, Justice Kagan, of a child or a spouse of a terrorist, there's a very typical situation: I'm an immigrant. I show up for my Green Card interview.

Instead, Congress wrote a statute, 1226(c), as an exception to the general detention scheme in 1226(a) which applies except as provided in subsection (c), not as except -- not except as provided in section (c)(2), as the government would have it. Congress wrote section 1226(c) in two paragraphs. The first paragraph says who gets taken into custody and when, and the second paragraph says of those people in paragraph (1) who can be released. Now the government claims instead, in a stretch of a reading, that you focus only on paragraphs (A) through (D) in paragraph (1). In other words, they say, section (c)(2) stands alone as an authorization for mandatory detention. But that's not what Congress said. It said except -- as an alien described in paragraph (1), not an alien described in paragraph (1)(A) through (D). And the government's reading, trying to pull section (2), (c)(2), out as that free-standing authorization, leads to three serious anomalies that they struggle to explain, as they did with you, Justice Kagan. The first anomaly is, as you noted, that the transition rules, which were meant to be a ramp-up to the permanent rule, are completely superfluous. If the government really could delay, for whatever reason, picking up people subject to mandatory detention for as long as it needs or wants, then Congress would not need to have that intermediate step. The second anomaly with the government's reading is -- and the government struggled with this in response, again, to your questions, Justice Kagan -- is that if the only qualification to be subject to mandatory detention is that you fall into one of the four categories in A through D, they necessarily read out the prior criminal custody requirement. In -- in addition to the example you gave, Justice Kagan, of a child or a spouse of a terrorist, there's a very typical situation: I'm an immigrant. I show up for my Green Card interview. And I live in California or Washington, and I confidently say, yes, I use marijuana on a regular basis. I've never been arrested. I've never been convicted of a controlled substance offense. But based on my admission to possession of a controlled substance, I might then be subject to mandatory detention on the spot as I sit there in a CIS office under the government's reading. Now the government acknowledges that eliminating a prior criminal custody requirement would be anomalous, and they do find, they do acknowledge there's a prior criminal custody requirement. But instead of finding that in the natural and obvious place within the four corners of this statute, that is, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, the phrase ""when the alien is released,"" they go hunting around back to the uncodified effective date provision for Section 1226(c), which says it applies to aliens released after October 8, 1998.

Second, it's not true that Congress wanted to detain and deport all criminal aliens, as the government claims in its reply brief at page 12. And, three, if Congress really wanted what the executive branch claims here, it would have simply written a statute that says people in these four categories shall be detained without a hearing until removed. That is not what Congress did. Instead, Congress wrote a statute, 1226(c), as an exception to the general detention scheme in 1226(a) which applies except as provided in subsection (c), not as except -- not except as provided in section (c)(2), as the government would have it. Congress wrote section 1226(c) in two paragraphs. The first paragraph says who gets taken into custody and when, and the second paragraph says of those people in paragraph (1) who can be released. Now the government claims instead, in a stretch of a reading, that you focus only on paragraphs (A) through (D) in paragraph (1). In other words, they say, section (c)(2) stands alone as an authorization for mandatory detention. But that's not what Congress said. It said except -- as an alien described in paragraph (1), not an alien described in paragraph (1)(A) through (D). And the government's reading, trying to pull section (2), (c)(2), out as that free-standing authorization, leads to three serious anomalies that they struggle to explain, as they did with you, Justice Kagan. The first anomaly is, as you noted, that the transition rules, which were meant to be a ramp-up to the permanent rule, are completely superfluous. If the government really could delay, for whatever reason, picking up people subject to mandatory detention for as long as it needs or wants, then Congress would not need to have that intermediate step. The second anomaly with the government's reading is -- and the government struggled with this in response, again, to your questions, Justice Kagan -- is that if the only qualification to be subject to mandatory detention is that you fall into one of the four categories in A through D, they necessarily read out the prior criminal custody requirement. In -- in addition to the example you gave, Justice Kagan, of a child or a spouse of a terrorist, there's a very typical situation: I'm an immigrant. I show up for my Green Card interview. And I live in California or Washington, and I confidently say, yes, I use marijuana on a regular basis. I've never been arrested. I've never been convicted of a controlled substance offense. But based on my admission to possession of a controlled substance, I might then be subject to mandatory detention on the spot as I sit there in a CIS office under the government's reading. Now the government acknowledges that eliminating a prior criminal custody requirement would be anomalous, and they do find, they do acknowledge there's a prior criminal custody requirement. But instead of finding that in the natural and obvious place within the four corners of this statute, that is, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, the phrase ""when the alien is released,"" they go hunting around back to the uncodified effective date provision for Section 1226(c), which says it applies to aliens released after October 8, 1998. That leads to a further anomaly, the third anomaly, which, as Judge Baron explained in his opinion in Castaneda, 810 F.3d at 29, that the transition period rule, again, which was meant to be an intermediate step up, is less broad -- excuse me, is broader than the permanent rule in Section 1226(c).</text>",2018,incoherent
11032,2018.16-1363-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch,"Okay. You've hinged a lot on the language, and you've told us to ignore what's happened after 1996 and, in response to Justice Sotomayor, went back to that language, ""when the alien is released."" But, if we're going to focus really carefully on the language, what do we do about the fact that that is an adverbial phrase? And you're asking us to suggest that it modifies the noun ""alien"" and limits the class of aliens that are involved. ""Alien"" is a noun. Adverbs don't usually modify nouns. They usually modify verbs. And the verb here is ""shall take into custody."" So why isn't it that the duty, ""shall take into custody,"" is modified by the adverb, ""when the alien is released,"" okay, and so the government's obligation begins at that moment. We know that's when the ""shall take into custody"" duty starts. But the class of aliens, the who, the noun, has nothing to do with the adverb.

11039,2018.16-1363-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I can see the equities when the alien has been free for a number of years. But Congress, wisely or not, thought that this class of aliens was dangerous and they should not be trusted. Bail hearings were unreliable. So you would say that this statute requires their detention as soon as they get out. Now why -- if that's the case, and it -- it obviously is, why would Congress think differently about someone who's been out for a week?","<speaker>Cecillia D. Wang</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government's reading is contrary to the text, structure, and purpose of the statute in at least three ways. One, it negates Congress's directive to use finite mandatory detention resources on those who would otherwise be released into the community from criminal custody. Second, it's not true that Congress wanted to detain and deport all criminal aliens, as the government claims in its reply brief at page 12. And, three, if Congress really wanted what the executive branch claims here, it would have simply written a statute that says people in these four categories shall be detained without a hearing until removed. That is not what Congress did. Instead, Congress wrote a statute, 1226(c), as an exception to the general detention scheme in 1226(a) which applies except as provided in subsection (c), not as except -- not except as provided in section (c)(2), as the government would have it. Congress wrote section 1226(c) in two paragraphs. The first paragraph says who gets taken into custody and when, and the second paragraph says of those people in paragraph (1) who can be released. Now the government claims instead, in a stretch of a reading, that you focus only on paragraphs (A) through (D) in paragraph (1). In other words, they say, section (c)(2) stands alone as an authorization for mandatory detention. But that's not what Congress said. It said except -- as an alien described in paragraph (1), not an alien described in paragraph (1)(A) through (D). And the government's reading, trying to pull section (2), (c)(2), out as that free-standing authorization, leads to three serious anomalies that they struggle to explain, as they did with you, Justice Kagan. The first anomaly is, as you noted, that the transition rules, which were meant to be a ramp-up to the permanent rule, are completely superfluous. If the government really could delay, for whatever reason, picking up people subject to mandatory detention for as long as it needs or wants, then Congress would not need to have that intermediate step. The second anomaly with the government's reading is -- and the government struggled with this in response, again, to your questions, Justice Kagan -- is that if the only qualification to be subject to mandatory detention is that you fall into one of the four categories in A through D, they necessarily read out the prior criminal custody requirement. In -- in addition to the example you gave, Justice Kagan, of a child or a spouse of a terrorist, there's a very typical situation: I'm an immigrant. I show up for my Green Card interview. And I live in California or Washington, and I confidently say, yes, I use marijuana on a regular basis. I've never been arrested. I've never been convicted of a controlled substance offense. But based on my admission to possession of a controlled substance, I might then be subject to mandatory detention on the spot as I sit there in a CIS office under the government's reading. Now the government acknowledges that eliminating a prior criminal custody requirement would be anomalous, and they do find, they do acknowledge there's a prior criminal custody requirement. But instead of finding that in the natural and obvious place within the four corners of this statute, that is, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, the phrase ""when the alien is released,"" they go hunting around back to the uncodified effective date provision for Section 1226(c), which says it applies to aliens released after October 8, 1998. That leads to a further anomaly, the third anomaly, which, as Judge Baron explained in his opinion in Castaneda, 810 F.3d at 29, that the transition period rule, again, which was meant to be an intermediate step up, is less broad -- excuse me, is broader than the permanent rule in Section 1226(c).</text>",2018,coherent

That formula helps courts and litigants navigate more than 200 statutes that use the term. It gives Congress a clear baseline against which to legislate and respects history because federal law has always defined by statute the costs that could be shifted between parties in cases at common law. Let's start with the history. Justice Sotomayor, you asked a question about the priority of enactment, the fact that this statute was originally enacted in 1831, even though the current version of Section 1920 is much more recent. What this Court said in Crawford Fitting is that the priority of enactment does not matter. Section 1920 presumptively applies in all civil cases, regardless of when those provisions were adopted. Going back to the original history, what is it that the term ""full costs"" was enacted in order to do? We think that it does a couple things. Five days after setting up the federal judiciary, Congress enacted the Process Act, telling federal courts to look to state fee bills in order to determine which costs could be shifted between litigants. That was the regime that prevailed at the time that this provision was added to the Copyright Act in 1831. There were two general types of state fee bill provisions that would have made the word ""full"" in full costs necessary, and we give a couple examples on page 17 of our brief, Footnote 1. The first type of case are statutes that impose some sort of limitation on costs. So an example would be the first statute, a Kentucky statute providing ""the plaintiff shall recover his full costs although the damages do not exceed 40 shillings."" There were a number of statutes that said, if your damages were not above a certain threshold, you would get no more cost than damages. Forty shillings was a typical amount. So this provision tells you that, even if your damages are below that type of threshold, nevertheless, you get your full costs. The second type of case is a case of a statutory multiplier. So the Mississippi statute, for instance, provided a landlord can recover ""double the value of rent in arrear and distrained for with full costs of the suit."" So you get double damages along with your full costs. And that's actually the sense in which we think the 1831 Copyright Act used the term ""full costs"" because, remember, that for an infringement, half of any forfeiture would go to the government and the other half would go to the plaintiff, along with their full costs. So the word ""full"" in that phrase tells you, even though the plaintiff is only getting half of the recovery, nevertheless, the plaintiff gets their full costs.</text>",2018,coherent

That formula helps courts and litigants navigate more than 200 statutes that use the term. It gives Congress a clear baseline against which to legislate and respects history because federal law has always defined by statute the costs that could be shifted between parties in cases at common law. Let's start with the history. Justice Sotomayor, you asked a question about the priority of enactment, the fact that this statute was originally enacted in 1831, even though the current version of Section 1920 is much more recent. What this Court said in Crawford Fitting is that the priority of enactment does not matter. Section 1920 presumptively applies in all civil cases, regardless of when those provisions were adopted. Going back to the original history, what is it that the term ""full costs"" was enacted in order to do? We think that it does a couple things. Five days after setting up the federal judiciary, Congress enacted the Process Act, telling federal courts to look to state fee bills in order to determine which costs could be shifted between litigants. That was the regime that prevailed at the time that this provision was added to the Copyright Act in 1831. There were two general types of state fee bill provisions that would have made the word ""full"" in full costs necessary, and we give a couple examples on page 17 of our brief, Footnote 1. The first type of case are statutes that impose some sort of limitation on costs. So an example would be the first statute, a Kentucky statute providing ""the plaintiff shall recover his full costs although the damages do not exceed 40 shillings."" There were a number of statutes that said, if your damages were not above a certain threshold, you would get no more cost than damages. Forty shillings was a typical amount. So this provision tells you that, even if your damages are below that type of threshold, nevertheless, you get your full costs. The second type of case is a case of a statutory multiplier. So the Mississippi statute, for instance, provided a landlord can recover ""double the value of rent in arrear and distrained for with full costs of the suit."" So you get double damages along with your full costs. And that's actually the sense in which we think the 1831 Copyright Act used the term ""full costs"" because, remember, that for an infringement, half of any forfeiture would go to the government and the other half would go to the plaintiff, along with their full costs. So the word ""full"" in that phrase tells you, even though the plaintiff is only getting half of the recovery, nevertheless, the plaintiff gets their full costs.</text>",2018,incoherent

14986,2018.17-1307-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Geyser, I -- I find this a difficult question. Going back to something that Justice Alito said, the reason I find it a difficult question is it seems to me that judicial foreclosures, non-judicial foreclosures, fall within both. They -- you know, these people are debt collectors under the language of the statute, and these people are enforcing security interests under the language of the statute. But that can't be right because the grammar of the statute suggests that we now have to kick them out of one or the other. All right? And so the question is, which do we kick them out of? Do we say, notwithstanding that they look like debt collectors, we're not going to treat them like debt collectors, or do we say that, notwithstanding that they enforce security interests, we're going to pretend that they don't? So, when I think about it that way, I kind of think: Well, I don't know, foreclosures are paradigmatic enforcement of security interests. There's nothing that gets more enforcing a security interest than foreclosing on a mortgage. So kicking them out of that one seems a little bit more odd than kicking them out of a very broad definition of debt collectors.","<speaker>Daniel L.
