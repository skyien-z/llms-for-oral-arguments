Not content to rely on the force of her ideas, she abused the coercive power of her office. In February 2018, she told Lloyd's, the insurance underwriter, that she'd go easy on its unrelated insurance viol ations if it aided her campaign to weaken the NRA by halting all business with the group. Lloyd's agreed. Six weeks later, she issued guidance letters and a press release directing the thousands of banks and insurance companies that she directly oversees to cut off their ties with  the NRA not because of any alleged illegality but because they promote guns. In the accompanying press release, Vullo's boss and co-defendant, Governor Andrew Cuomo, said he directed Vullo to issue the  guidance because doing business with the NRA ""sends the wrong message.""  Shortly thereafter,  Vullo extracted legally binding consent orders from the NRA's three principal insurance providers, barring them from ever providing affinity insurance to the group ever again, no matter how lawfully they do so. These actions worked as multiple financial institutions refused to do business with the NRA, citing Vullo's threats. This was not about enforcing insurance law or mere government speech.

The Compact does so by incorporating and protecting the delivery of water by the Rio Grande Project to Mexico and to two irrigation districts, one in New Mexico and the other in Texas.

As New Mexico acknowledges, the Compact imposes on New Mexico a duty not to interfere with the Project's delivery of water. The United States claims that New Mexico is violating that duty by allowing too much groundwater pumping. Six years ago, this Court upheld the United States' right to pursue those Compact claims, recognizing that the United States has distinctively federal interests in protecting the supply and the allocation of Project water. Those distinctively federal interests are why the United States is still here today.

The proposed consent decree in this case, however, would dispose of the United States' claims without its consent. The decree would impose obligations on the United States without its consent. And the decree would bind the United States to an interpretation of the R io Grande Compact that is contrary to the Compact itself. For each of those reasons, the proposed decree should be rejected. I want to emphasize why the United States is here today. The Compact apportions the water below Elephant Butte. The Compact does so by incorporating and protecting the delivery of water by the Rio Grande Project to Mexico and to two irrigation districts, one in New Mexico and the other in Texas. The United States intervened in this case to enforce the Compact's protection of the project. As New Mexico acknowledges, the Compact imposes on New Mexico a duty not to interfere with the Project's delivery of water. The United States claims that New Mexico is violating that duty by allowing too much groundwater pumping. Six years ago, this Court upheld the United States' right to pursue those Compact claims, recognizing that the United States has distinctively federal interests in protecting the supply and the allocation of Project water. Those distinctively federal interests are why the United States is still here today. In the United States' view, the proposed decree fails to address the groundwater pumping that precipitated this suit in the first place. Instead, the proposed decree would allow that pumping to continue at unsustainable levels, and it would not stop that pumping from taking water from the Project's beneficiaries, namely, the two irrigation districts and  -- and -- and Mexico. The proposed decree would thus fail to protect the Project or the Compact's apportionment, and that is why the United States could not give its consent to this proposed decree.

Our narrow submission in this case is that government cannot circumvent the principle of Robinson by making it unlawful for a person to reside in the jurisdiction if he has that status. That is what the ordinances here do. As applied to someone who has nowhere else to  sleep, which is an essential human function, the ordinances are the equivalent of making it a  crime to be homeless while living in Grants Pass. Although  we think the Ninth Circuit was right to recognize that the core principle of Robinson is implicated in this case, the Court was wrong to award broad injunctive relief in the circumstances and manner in which it did. The Robinson principle requires an individualized determination, and the Ninth Circuit's failure to require such a determination and its issuance of much broader injunctive relief has led to the problems at issue that the Petitioner and its amici have raised, not the core principle of Robinson. And, therefore, we urge the Court to adhere to the core principle of Robinson but to emphasize that cities have flexibility to implement these and, in particular, time, p lace, and manner restrictions on where someone can sleep are entirely valid if they are reasonable,  and, indeed, the state law that Justice Jackson referred to establishes a state policy that  time, manner, and place restrictions are the way to go if they are reasonable.

For the past 40 years, the Federal Circuit has recognized the same thing and has repeatedly held that the time limit here is jurisdictional.

Petitioner's contrary arguments fail to offer any plausible alternative reading of the statutory text. His argument that none of Section 7703(b)(1) is jurisdictional is directly contrary to Lindahl and would make Section 1295(a)(9)'s grant of jurisdiction incomplete.

Adopting Petitioner's view would require the Court to read ""pursuant to"" to mean different things for the different sentences of Section 7703(b)(1).

Wall</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In The Bremen and Carnival, this Court held that forum-selection clauses in maritime contracts are enforceable as a matter of federal law, except in the rare circumstances when they violate federal maritime policy. Almost all federal courts, including all of the major maritime courts, have taken the same approach for choice-of-law clauses. This Court should do the same for three reasons. First, logic and consistency. We're here talking about a federal exception to a federal presumption of enforceability. It stands to reason that federal exception would look to federal public policy, not state public policy. Raiders doesn't point to any analogous federal exception. It looks to state public policy. And it doesn't explain why choice of law in maritime should be any different from forum selection in maritime. Second, the consensus approach makes practical sense for the reasons that this Court gave in The Bremen. Judging choice-of-law clauses by reference to a uniform body of federal law accords with ancient concepts of freedom of contract, and it allows parties to gauge and price their risks knowing what law will apply to their contracts. If 50 states may set aside parties' choices based on their own public policies, that would be a reference for uncertainty and forum shopping. Third, the consensus approach is clear and administrable. On our approach, a federal court would ask, does a choice-of-law clause offend federal admiralty policy? The answer to that question will almost always be no.

Like, as a -- so setting aside what -- what Wilburn Boat -- I'm just trying to understand one reason why it would be that the federal exception -- you'd have to have federal interests in the exception is a couple, one is that we have a general rule and we have an exception and unless you actually have sort of the same dynamic working, you could easily see how the exception could swallow the rule. You'd never have the rule, right, because the exception is sort of being established on a different plane. So that's one thing. Another thing is, to the extent we're talking about federal interests overarching this entire dynamic, we know, as Justice Sotomayor says, the federal interests are in uniformity and predictability and all of those sorts of things. So, if we have a single federal spokesperson regarding what is accepted, you're more likely to advance the interests of uniformity and predictability, whereas if you have state interests operating in the exception, you're going to have all of these different exceptions popping up at different times and people aren't going to know what they're doing. So I appreciate that there's a world in which insurance contracts are different and they're ordinarily run by the states and each state has a particular interest, consumer protection, not, or whatever, but if our entire kind of framing is about ensuring predictability and uniformity, why would we have a world in which we would allow different state policy interests to be driving the exception in this way?","<speaker>Howard J.

First, it failed to give any deference to the district court's factual determinations.

20193,2023.22-982-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Perfect. All right. I agree. I -- I think what Justice Kagan is saying is that that standard takes into account for the purpose of its application that all of the mitigating evidence is being presented, that we present this mitigating evidence, we present this aggravating evidence, and would, if all of that had happened, be out -- is there a reasonable probability that the outcome would be different?  I think the problem that's happening here is that the district court, being a district court, is screening the mitigating  evidence upfront. There's sort of like another layer being added to this on the front end where  the district court, as you said in response to Justice Gorsuch, is deciding, well, is this really mitigating evidence?  Is this a fact?  Did this thing happen?  And it's sort of putting that initial screen on it so that when we get to the Strickland weighing, we have a smaller corpus of mitigating evidence because we've already weeded out the stuff that the district court  --I think that's not what's supposed to be happening actually. I think that whether or not this thing is actually a fact is determined ultimately, that at this level right now, the district court is just deciding whether or not that this basically has to go back to the states, whether the person gets habeas and it's got to be  done over again in some sense. And later is where we find out whether or not the thing is really true. But, in the context of Strickland prejudice, we're just saying this fact was never presented at all. And the question is to what  extent was the defendant prejudiced by that omission. So we're not screening upfront for whether or not that fact was true in any sense. We're sort of accepting it and -- and  -- and saying:  Well, in any event, the defendant might  not even be prejudiced because it was such a thing, right, that it doesn't outweigh the aggravators, so we're not going to send it back.

Despite numerous red flags about Jones's mental health and emotional disorders, counsel did not start his mitigation case or  mitigation investigation until after Jones's conviction and all he did was request an Arizona Rule 26.5 evaluator. The result was that the sentencing judge heard only about Jones's complicated birth, abuse by his first step -father up until age 6, some head injuries, and from the Rule 26.5  evaluator, that Jones had some ""possible"" neurological abnormalities, and that was because the evaluator did not have the time and it would be beyond his charge to make actual diagnoses. At the federal evidentiary  hearing in this case, of course, Mr. Jones introduced substantial new mitigation evidence that the  -- that the sentencing judge had never heard. The new mitigating evidence showed that Jones was chronically abused throughout his entire formative years in childhood, well beyond age 6 by not just one but by multiple male family members, he was plied with alc ohol by a step-grandfather who then sexually abused him, and, most critically, the new mitigation evidence actually included diagnoses, evidence about the effects that all the abuse and head injuries had on Jones. These included the opinions of four experts who diagnosed him with, among other things, brain damage, PTSD, bipolar depressive disorder, and a learning disability. All this new evidence would have dramatically changed the sentencing calculus  both in the trial court and before the Arizona Supreme Court on its independent review. But, instead of looking at the sum total of all the evidence and asking whether it established a reasonable probability that the Arizona court system might have imposed a different sentence, the district court serially nit-picked all of Jones's mitigating evidence and then offered its view of what it thought the more persuasive side was.

These included the opinions of four experts who diagnosed him with, among other things, brain damage, PTSD, bipolar depressive disorder, and a learning disability. All this new evidence would have dramatically changed the sentencing calculus  both in the trial court and before the Arizona Supreme Court on its independent review.

There are amici here who tell us that the Founders actually talked about whether to grant immunity to the president. And, in fact, they had state constitutions that granted some criminal  immunity to governors. And yet they didn't take it up. Instead, they -- they passed an impeachment clause that basically says you can't remove the president from office except by a  trial in the Senate, but you can impeach him after. So  -- or you can -- can impose criminal liability. We would be creating a situation in which we would be saying  --this is what you're asking us to say -- which is that a president is entitled not to make a mistake but more than that.

21284,2023.23-939-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett," Mr. Dreeben, I want to pick up with that public authority defense. So I'm looking at the OLC memo that David Barron wrote that you cited in your briefs, and he describes the public authority defense citing the model penal code. There are a few different  definitions, but I'll just highlight this one: Justifying conduct which is required or authorized by the law defining the duties or functions of a public officer, the law governing the armed services or lawful conduct of war, or any other provision of law imposing a public duty. That sounds a lot like dividing a line between official and private conduct. I think it's narrower, and I recognize it's a defense, not an immunity, but when we look at -- when you look at the definition of it, are you acting within the scope of authority conferred by law or discharging a duty conferred by law?

I mean, we have amicus briefs here, from Professor Lederman, for example, who says, you know, a president would not be prohibited by statute from perjuring himself under oath about official matters, from corruptly altering, destroying, or concealing documents to prevent them from being used in an official proceeding, from suborning others to commit perjury, from bribing witnesses or public officials. And he goes on and on and on about the things th at a president in office with the knowledge that they have no criminal accountability would do.

The court of appeals found authority for that release in a catchall provision of Chapter 11. Section 1123(b)(6) says a plan may include any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with the applicable provisions of this title.

It permits the Sacklers to decide how much they're going to contribute.

Let's imagine the bankruptcy wraps up. Then people do go after the Sacklers, and let's say they secure judgments, and the Sacklers want to seek indemnification from Purdue. As I understand it, there's a division of authority in the courts below about whether these would be prepetition or post-petition claims and so whether they would even be allowed. But I also am wondering, what's left to get? So, if they're bringing these indemnification claims, you know, and Purdue has been restructured, where are they going to get money anyway?

Second, this case illustrates how third-party releases can and do directly advance the core objectives of bankruptcy in appropriate and appropriately limited circumstances. Because of the inextricable relationship between Purdue and the Sackler directors and officers of Purdue, victims have filed identical claims against Purdue and the Sacklers for the same injuries based on the same conduct.

How would this agree -- how would it look different from the release?","<speaker>Curtis E. Gannon</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. The court of appeals approved a Chapter 11 reorganization plan that will release claims that Purdue Pharma's creditors have against other nondebtors, principally, the Sackler family members who took billions of dollars from Purdue in the years before Purdue's bankruptcy but have not filed for bankruptcy protection themselves and have made only a portion of their assets available to the estate in Purdue's bankruptcy. The court of appeals found authority for that release in a catchall provision of Chapter 11. Section 1123(b)(6) says a plan may include any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with the applicable provisions of this title. But this release goes beyond what the statute authorizes as construed in its context, and it also conflicts with the basic nuts and bolts of the Bankruptcy Code's comprehensive scheme. It permits the Sacklers to decide how much they're going to contribute. It grants the Sacklers the functional equivalent of a discharge, what they might get if they themselves were in bankruptcy, though even such a discharge would not extend, as this one does, to claims involving fraud and willful misconduct and even though Section 524(e) expressly provides that the discharge of a debtor does not affect the liability of any other entity. This release extinguishes personal property rights, the creditors' state law chosen action, that do not belong to the bankruptcy estate. That result is not supported by any historical analogue in equity, and it raises significant constitutional questions that should be avoided in the absence of a clear command from Congress.

Gannon</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Last fiscal year, the Department of State issued 11 million immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. It also refused 62,000 visa applications on the basis of  one or more of the inadmissibility grounds in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a), including applications from approximately 5400 noncitizens seeking to live with their U.S. citizen spouses or fiances. Under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability, a noncitizen outside the United States cannot obtain judicial review of a consular officer's denial of a visa. Congress has not provided for that form of review in the INA, and when it added new visa-related provisions in 2002, it reaffirmed that it was not providing an end run around that. Nor is an end run available when a U.S. citizen family member -- here, the noncitizen spouse  -- wants the noncitizen to be admitted into the United States. As the Kerry against Din plurality concluded in 2015, that is not a liberty interest protected by the Due  Process Clause, and the U.S. citizen is affected only indirectly by the government's action against the noncitizen. Thus, Respondent Munoz cannot challenge the denial of her husband's visa application any more than she could challenge a decision at the end of a removal proceeding that he will be removed from the United States or at the end of a criminal trial that he would be sent to a prison far across the country. With respect to the second question presented, even assuming that Respondent  Munoz has a sufficient constitutional interest to trigger any judicial review, the Court should at the very least hold that the State Department satisfied the Mandel standard.

23437,2023.23-334 -t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," Counsel, the husband has no right of review, you're correct. And it's a judicially created exception of nonreviewability. So, if we make an exception,  it's us accepting something that's not statutory or constitutionally required. Her point is, whether it's her or her husband, they each should have a right to dispute whatever basis it was that formed your denial. And let's assume it was something as simple or -- as misidentification. You thought he was John Doe, and you had a whole criminal record on John Doe. And he's not John Doe; he's John Smith, John Smith Doe, which is another person. So the reason she's asking for an explanation and one that's required is that she says:  I have a right equal to the Mandel professor's. They had a First Amendment right to invite a professor to come speak to them. I have an equal constitutional right to live with my husband if I can. The second question is, is that a liberty interest?  And you say it's not. So let's take each of your points, okay?  As far back as 1888, this Court said in Maynard that getting married is something more than a mere contract, which is your position in your brief, that it's only statutory rights or benefits. In 1923, this Court described in one breath the right ""to marry, establish a home, and bring up children.""  And that right is one long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men. That's our Meyer case. In Loving versus Virginia, we said marriage is fundamental. In United States versus Windsor, we said marriage is more than a routine classification for purposes of certain statutory benefits. So  --and Obergefell, I'm not going to cite it, but it said something to that effect. So, if I assume that there's a liberty interest that has to be protected by some sort of process, then the question is, what kind of process is enough?  And in Mandel and in Nken, we talked about the statutory -- citing at least a statutory basis for exclusion. Here, you're saying she's entitled to nothing. Why do we have to go that far?

She doesn't have a liberty interest in having the visa granted, but she does have a liberty interest in knowing why and an opportunity to oppose it if there is an opposition that can be had. But the review would be very limited. In Din, we said the process due is just knowing the reason and a statutory citation because he's entitled to know -- she's entitled to know he was a terrorist. In a conviction, the husband has gotten full notice, all the grounds have been told to the wife because there's been a public adjudication of that ground. Similarly, with all the other exa mples you provide, full process has been provided. But what you're saying is I have a right and, judicially created, we're going to say, there is no process whatsoever you're entitled to.

Under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability, a noncitizen outside the United States cannot obtain judicial review of a consular officer's denial of a visa.

23468,2023.23-334 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," No, I understand that, but I'm just trying to see how your argument maps onto what the Court actually did in Mandel. And as I read that case, as I look at it, the first thing they're asking is whether these professors had some sort of right to receive information and ideas as protected under the First Amendment. They weren't saying at the level that you're saying now do they have a right to have this particular person -- or do they have a  liberty interest in having this individual come to the United States as their first question. It looks as though the way this opinion is structured, Justice Blackmun starts off by saying, in a variety of contexts, this Court has referred to a First Amendment right to  receive information and ideas, and he goes on and talks about that. And then he gets to the point that you're talking about when he says, ""Recognition that First Amendment rights are implicated, however, is not dispositive of our inquiry.""  And then he goes on to do the rest of the inquiry. So I think the parallel structure here would be the recognition that there is, as we've said in so many cases, a fundamental right to marriage, to include cohabitation, to raising your family. Those things exist. And that's implicated by the government's decision not to allow a person to come in -- the spouse to come into the United States. And then you go on to determine whether or not, even though you have this right that's implicated, the other aspects of the test. What's -- what's wrong with thinking about it that way?  Because I -- I hear you  shifting the fundamental right at the beginning in answer to  --to the QP.","<speaker>Curtis E.

We do not claim that this interest gives her the right to immigrate her husband regardless of his inadmissibility, but the importance of cohabitation to marriage means  that the government is required to provide procedural protections when it burdens the underlying right. The statute also informs what process is required. There's nothing unusual about this. Wh en government action burdens a substantive right, the Court often relies on procedural protections to balance the implications of that burden against the government's countervailin g interest. The statute likewise here shows why Ms. Munoz was herself deprived of that liberty interest and undermines the government's argument that she was a mere bystander. Under the INA, the citizen petitioner must initiate and advance her spouse's application from start to finish, and the very purpose of the consular process for spouses is to benefit the American citizen spouse. Given this interest, judicial review is required. This Court has repeatedly acknowledged that the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens can be implicated by visa denials, and when they are, that review is necessary. Procedural due process, therefore, requires notice sufficient to allow a meaningful  opportunity to respond. A mere citation to a broad statute that encompasses any other  unlawful activity forced Ms. Munoz to guess at the reason for the denial and provided only a mere gesture at due process, which this Court said was insufficient in Mullane.

We do not claim that this interest gives her the right to immigrate her husband regardless of his inadmissibility, but the importance of cohabitation to marriage means  that the government is required to provide procedural protections when it burdens the underlying right. The statute also informs what process is required. There's nothing unusual about this. Wh en government action burdens a substantive right, the Court often relies on procedural protections to balance the implications of that burden against the government's countervailin g interest. The statute likewise here shows why Ms. Munoz was herself deprived of that liberty interest and undermines the government's argument that she was a mere bystander. Under the INA, the citizen petitioner must initiate and advance her spouse's application from start to finish, and the very purpose of the consular process for spouses is to benefit the American citizen spouse. Given this interest, judicial review is required. This Court has repeatedly acknowledged that the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens can be implicated by visa denials, and when they are, that review is necessary. Procedural due process, therefore, requires notice sufficient to allow a meaningful  opportunity to respond. A mere citation to a broad statute that encompasses any other  unlawful activity forced Ms. Munoz to guess at the reason for the denial and provided only a mere gesture at due process, which this Court said was insufficient in Mullane.

Putting aside the issue of sovereign immunity, wouldn't that suggest that it applies to the -- the U.S. Government? ","<speaker>Benjamin W. Snyder</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The question in this case is whether Congress unambiguously waived the sovereign immunity of the United States when it amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1996 to provide that any person who violates FCRA's requirements is liable for money damages.  The answer to that question is no. To start, there's no basis for claiming that Congress has expressly waived sovereign immunity. For all of Respondent's emphasis on following the literal text of the statute, he ultimately has to concede that nothing in FCRA addresses sovereign immunity directly.  Instead, Respondent is asking this Court to read an unwritten waiver into the statute on the theory that every time Congress creates a cause of action that applies to both sovereign and non-sovereign defendants, it must implicitly intend to eliminate sovereign immunity. But that argument is wrong for two reasons. First, it's fundamentally inconsistent with the nature of sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity is a defense that, by definition, has effect only when there is a cause of action that would otherwise impose liability. So, if every cause of action that covers a sovereign also waived that sovereign's immunity, the defense would never matter. That cannot be right.  This Court has therefore followed a narrower rule under which courts may infer a waiver of sovereign immunity from a cause of action only if Congress has referred to sovereign defendants in the cause of action itself using language that would be effectively negated if sovereign immunity remained available and that therefore shows Congress's intent to displace the presumptively available defense.  But there's nothing like that here. And as the Court's decision in Employees shows, the mere use of a general term defined elsewhere in the statute isn't enough to eliminate the sovereign immunity defense. Second, it's in any event far from clear that these causes of action apply to the United States at all.

But that argument is wrong for two reasons. First, it's fundamentally inconsistent with the nature of sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity is a defense that, by definition, has effect only when there is a cause of action that would otherwise impose liability. So, if every cause of action that covers a sovereign also waived that sovereign's immunity, the defense would never matter. That cannot be right.  This Court has therefore followed a narrower rule under which courts may infer a waiver of sovereign immunity from a cause of action only if Congress has referred to sovereign defendants in the cause of action itself using language that would be effectively negated if sovereign immunity remained available and that therefore shows Congress's intent to displace the presumptively available defense.  But there's nothing like that here. And as the Court's decision in Employees shows, the mere use of a general term defined elsewhere in the statute isn't enough to eliminate the sovereign immunity defense. Second, it's in any event far from clear that these causes of action apply to the United States at all.

Snyder</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The question in this case is whether Congress unambiguously waived the sovereign immunity of the United States when it amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1996 to provide that any person who violates FCRA's requirements is liable for money damages.  The answer to that question is no. To start, there's no basis for claiming that Congress has expressly waived sovereign immunity. For all of Respondent's emphasis on following the literal text of the statute, he ultimately has to concede that nothing in FCRA addresses sovereign immunity directly.  Instead, Respondent is asking this Court to read an unwritten waiver into the statute on the theory that every time Congress creates a cause of action that applies to both sovereign and non-sovereign defendants, it must implicitly intend to eliminate sovereign immunity. But that argument is wrong for two reasons. First, it's fundamentally inconsistent with the nature of sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity is a defense that, by definition, has effect only when there is a cause of action that would otherwise impose liability. So, if every cause of action that covers a sovereign also waived that sovereign's immunity, the defense would never matter. That cannot be right.  This Court has therefore followed a narrower rule under which courts may infer a waiver of sovereign immunity from a cause of action only if Congress has referred to sovereign defendants in the cause of action itself using language that would be effectively negated if sovereign immunity remained available and that therefore shows Congress's intent to displace the presumptively available defense.  But there's nothing like that here. And as the Court's decision in Employees shows, the mere use of a general term defined elsewhere in the statute isn't enough to eliminate the sovereign immunity defense. Second, it's in any event far from clear that these causes of action apply to the United States at all. Even the court of appeals recognized that FCRA's criminal provision uses ""person"" in a sense that does not include federal agencies, and it's plausible to interpret the nearby civil causes of action in the same way.

I mean, it seems to me that what happened in Employees, to the extent that there was some uncertainty about what Congress did, it was because Congress amended the definitions section, right, to include governments, and that definitions section applied to a whole host of things in the statute, the duties, the liabilities, or whatnot, and so there was palpable uncertainty on the Court's part as to whether expanding -- what was it -- employers to include government actually affected a waiver of liability with respect to the liability section. It seems to me here, when we have the amendment to the liability section expanding, as you conceded previously, the liability section to include other entities by use of the term ""person"" that had been previously defined to include government, we're actually accomplishing a different result.

Shanmugam</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  To ensure continuity in their operations, closely held corporations will often agree to redeem the stock of a shareholder upon his death and then obtain a life insurance policy on the shareholder in order to fund the redemption obligation. This case presents the question of how the federal estate tax treats such arrangements. Because the proceeds from a life insurance policy to fulfill a contractual redemption obligation do not increase the corporation's net worth, they do not increase the estate tax owed on the decedent's stock. The court of appeals' contrary conclusion was erroneous. The legal framework governing this case is relatively straightforward. The Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations  provide that where the parties agree on the price to redeem a shareholder's stock, that  price will establish the value of the stock for purposes of the estate tax in certain circumstances. But where, as here, those circumstances have not been met, the value of  the stock is determined by the price at which such stock would change hands between a hypothetical willing buyer and willing seller. Here, a hypothetical buyer would not treat the life insurance proceeds as increasing the value of the stock because that asset is offset by the contractual obligation to redeem shares, a preexisting corporate liability. Now the government argues that a court should attach no weight to the redemption obligation when assessing the value of the company. But the government fails to distinguish between a contractual obligation to redeem stock on the one hand and a voluntary stock redemption on the other. A hypothetical buyer would treat the contractual redemption obligation like any other debt that reduces the net worth and therefore the value of the company. The government's  approach would lead to a grossly inflated valuation of the decedent's shares, and it would effectively lead to double taxation. It would defy common sense to take one side of the transaction into account but to ignore the other for purposes of the estate tax.

25695,2023.23-146 -t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Mr. Shanmugam, can I just ask you  --because I'm trying to follow. So you've said many times that the money is going out, but I guess I'm trying to figure out whether the proceeds of the life insurance are really going out when they're being used to redeem the shares. So what --what is the effect on the value of the remaining shares once the redemption occurs?","<speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  To ensure continuity in their operations, closely held corporations will often agree to redeem the stock of a shareholder upon his death and then obtain a life insurance policy on the shareholder in order to fund the redemption obligation. This case presents the question of how the federal estate tax treats such arrangements. Because the proceeds from a life insurance policy to fulfill a contractual redemption obligation do not increase the corporation's net worth, they do not increase the estate tax owed on the decedent's stock. The court of appeals' contrary conclusion was erroneous. The legal framework governing this case is relatively straightforward. The Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations  provide that where the parties agree on the price to redeem a shareholder's stock, that  price will establish the value of the stock for purposes of the estate tax in certain circumstances. But where, as here, those circumstances have not been met, the value of  the stock is determined by the price at which such stock would change hands between a hypothetical willing buyer and willing seller. Here, a hypothetical buyer would not treat the life insurance proceeds as increasing the value of the stock because that asset is offset by the contractual obligation to redeem shares, a preexisting corporate liability. Now the government argues that a court should attach no weight to the redemption obligation when assessing the value of the company. But the government fails to distinguish between a contractual obligation to redeem stock on the one hand and a voluntary stock redemption on the other. A hypothetical buyer would treat the contractual redemption obligation like any other debt that reduces the net worth and therefore the value of the company. The government's  approach would lead to a grossly inflated valuation of the decedent's shares, and it would effectively lead to double taxation. It would defy common sense to take one side of the transaction into account but to ignore the other for purposes of the estate tax.

According to the estate,  before we can value Michael's shares in Crown, we must first subtract the price that Crown paid for Michael's shares. In other words, the estate's theory is that before you can value something, you must first subtract the price paid for the very thing you are trying to value. That makes no sense.

The estate's contrary view rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of a redemption obligation. A redemption obligation is not a corporate debt that reduces the corporation's net worth or the value of the shares to be redeemed. A debt owed to creditors reduces corporate and shareholder value. A redemption obligation divides the corporate pie  among existing shareholders without changing the value of their interests. And here the corporate pie was worth 6.86  million, not 3.86 million.

That defeats their position because that means that Crown's total net worth before the family divided the company was 6.86 million.

According to the estate,  before we can value Michael's shares in Crown, we must first subtract the price that Crown paid for Michael's shares. In other words, the estate's theory is that before you can value something, you must first subtract the price paid for the very thing you are trying to value. That makes no sense. Using the item you're trying to value as a line item in its own valuation will never give you the correct answer, and it doesn't give the estate the right answer here either. The estate's contrary view rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of a redemption obligation. A redemption obligation is not a corporate debt that reduces the corporation's net worth or the value of the shares to be redeemed. A debt owed to creditors reduces corporate and shareholder value. A redemption obligation divides the corporate pie  among existing shareholders without changing the value of their interests. And here the corporate pie was worth 6.86  million, not 3.86 million. And that's true even if you look only at the statute of limitation estate's own incomes. Walked away from the redemption with approximately $3 million in cash, but Petitioner also admits that Thomas walked away from the redemption with $3.86 million in value. And the estate doesn't dispute the Black Letter valuation principle that the interest of each equity shareholder added together has to equal the company's total value. That defeats their position because that means that Crown's total net worth before the family divided the company was 6.86 million. The value of the two equities licenses put back together and that means the estate evaluation of Michael's 77 percent stake in Crown at $3 million came nowhere close to fair market value.

It should be overruled for three reasons. First, Chevron violates the Constitution. Article III empowers judges to say what the law is. It requires them to interpret federal statutes using their best and independent judgment. Chevron undermines that duty. It reallocates interpretive authority from courts to agencies, and it forces courts to adopt inferior agency constructions that are issued for political or policy reasons. In doing so, Chevron blocks judges from serving as faithful agents of Congress. It mandates judicial bias and encourages agency overreach. And by  removing key checks on executive power, it threatens individual liberty. Chevron also violates the APA. The most straightforward reading of Section 706 requires de novo review of legal questions.

I see Chevron as doing the very important work of helping courts stay away from policymaking, and so I -- I'd like for you to sort of think of it through that lens and help me understand why, if we do away with Chevron's framework, we won't have a problem of courts actually making a policy decision. So Justice Kagan gave you a number of examples, and I think the reason why th ose examples are hard or why they're ambiguous or whatever is because, at bottom, they're not asking legal questions; they're asking policy questions. How is it that, you know, ""stationary source"" is to be defined?  That's  not really a legal question. I mean, there could be several reasonable ways of interpreting  that. And at the end of the day, I think the way I've been thinking about Chevron is Congress has given that policy choice to the agency. And my concern is that if we take away something like Chevron, the court will then suddenly become a policymaker, by majority rule or not, making policy determinations.

I mean, isn't Chevron, step one, even in this very case, asking the question, one, has Congress made that policy determination?  So, for example, here, the  question is whether or not monitors on the boats have to be paid for by the owner of the boat. I see that as a policy question. Congress could have said yes or no. There's nothing about law really inherently in the question of should the monitors on the boats be paid for by the owners or the government. So step one is has Congress in the statute answered that question. When we say no, everybody agrees that's not in the statute, then we say the agency can make that determination so long as they do so in a reasonable way.

And then, just by the nature of things and especially the nature of the subject, there are going to be all kinds of places where,  although there's not an explicit delegation, Congress has, in effect, left a gap. It has  created an ambiguity. And what Congress is thinking is, do we want courts to fill that gap, or do we want an agency to fill that gap?

And what I'm thinking about is what I mentioned previously with your friend on the other side, which is that some scholars have actually identified different kinds of ambiguity. So, in one scenario, we have a statute that uses a broad term, and that term encompasses a range of reasonable meanings. There are three or four different ways that could be reasonably  -- you know, the meaning of ""stationary source,"" for example. But then there's also the kind of ambiguity in which a statute can mean only one thing, either A or B, perhaps because of the way the  -- the -- the language, you know, is put forward in the statute. It's just unclear whether it means A or B. I take these scholars to mean that, really, in -- the former scenario is the one in which we have a situation, you know, where  Chevron deference would be required.

Joshua Rosenkranz</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  When Congress directed courts to stay the trial of a case in deference to arbitration, it meant stop the litigation in court. It did not mean you must retain jurisdiction. It did not mean never dismiss, no matter how clear it is that the case will never come back to court. I get that modern lawyers often think of stays and dismissals as two completely distinct animals, but when Congress passed Section 3 a hundred years ago, Congress would not have drawn that stark a distinction. The drafters would have understood that a dismissal was one way to stay a litigation. When Congress intended that a court retain jurisdiction, it used those words in Section 8. Even if that is not the best understanding, this Court should accept it as long as it's plausible. Courts generally have the discretion to dismiss cases without prejudice when no one is asking them to do anything here and now and when another forum is actively adjudicating the case. If Congress wants to revoke that inherent power, it's got to do it clearly, and as Mr. Geyser said, Congress did nothing clearly in this statute. Congress did not issue such a clear direction. Congress does not even mention requiring ongoing jurisdiction. It does not even prohibit dismissing.

Joshua Rosenkranz</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  When Congress directed courts to stay the trial of a case in deference to arbitration, it meant stop the litigation in court. It did not mean you must retain jurisdiction. It did not mean never dismiss, no matter how clear it is that the case will never come back to court. I get that modern lawyers often think of stays and dismissals as two completely distinct animals, but when Congress passed Section 3 a hundred years ago, Congress would not have drawn that stark a distinction. The drafters would have understood that a dismissal was one way to stay a litigation. When Congress intended that a court retain jurisdiction, it used those words in Section 8. Even if that is not the best understanding, this Court should accept it as long as it's plausible. Courts generally have the discretion to dismiss cases without prejudice when no one is asking them to do anything here and now and when another forum is actively adjudicating the case. If Congress wants to revoke that inherent power, it's got to do it clearly, and as Mr. Geyser said, Congress did nothing clearly in this statute. Congress did not issue such a clear direction. Congress does not even mention requiring ongoing jurisdiction. It does not even prohibit dismissing. Congress passed  Section 3 to enforce contractual obligations to arbitrate and to avoid parallel litigation in court, not to encourage parallel litigation and reward plaintiffs who violate their contracts by suing in court.

26221,2023.22-1218-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Well, sure. If the defendant has won, but let's say we have a situation in which a plaintiff who originally brought this case in court because they thought it was the kind of thing that should be litigated in court, lost the motion for arbitrability, so it's now sent off to an arbitrator, and then, miracle of miracles, they win on the arbitration. My question is, isn't that a situation in which a plaintiff could at least come back to the district court if it had been stayed and asked for confirmation?","<speaker>E.
