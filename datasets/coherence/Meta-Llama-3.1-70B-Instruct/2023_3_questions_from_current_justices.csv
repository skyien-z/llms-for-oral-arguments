Corner Post's clock started when it swiped its first debit card and paid its first fee. That is the right outcome here for three main reasons. First and most importantly, the text.

This Court has said that phrase means the clock starts only once a plaintiff can sue, and this Court has also said that an APA plaintiff can sue only once it's first harmed by regulation. We just want the  Court to apply those settled p rinciples. By contrast, the government wants a special rule that contradicts how accrual statutes have worked since at least the 1830s. That government-only carveout would convert Section 2401 into a repose -based statute like the Hobbs Act. But Congress knows exactly how to craft repose-based statutes when it wants to, and it hasn't done so for APA claims. Second, with no textual foothold, the government resorts to policy arguments. It says that siding with Corner Post will undermine reliance interests because it will let plaintiffs challenge rules that are older than six years. But challenges to those rules already happen all the time in the as-applied context, and the government ad mits that as-applied challenges have no time limit.

You know, in a tort situation, when there's a duty, if there's a breach and injury as a result of the breach, those facts have occurred, the cause of action has arisen, and we say the clock starts running at that point because a claim against the defendant can be sustained in court when those facts exist.

I think the law regarding to -- you know, when a plaintiff can bring a claim is something different, but we have here a cause  of action arising out of the final agency action because that is the point at which a person can sustain a claim against the agency under the APA.

Snyder</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  For decades, the courts of appeals have consistently recognized that the six-year statute of limitations on an APA claim accrues at the time of the challenged agency action, not the time when a particular plaintiff comes within the relevant statute's zone of interests. In asking this Court to reject that settled practice, Corner Post argues that the word ""accrues"" in Section 2401(a) invariably refers to a time at which a specific plaintiff obtains a complete and present cause of action and that every newly formed entity therefore has six years to challenge any prior agency actions that affect its business or other interests, even if those actions occurred decades ago. Nothing in the APA or Section 2401(a) requires that destabilizing result. In Crown Coat Front Company, this Court explicitly rejected Corner Post's one-size-fits-all definition of ""accrues,"" warning of the hazards of attempting to devise a single accrual rule for all purposes. Instead, the Court explained that to apply the general word ""accrues"" a court has to  consider the particular type of claim at issue and how the practical purposes of a statute of limitations apply in that context. In conducting that necessary analysis, courts should give primary weight to evidence about the accrual rule that Congress itself has adopted when it has specifically focused on other claims of the same type. Doing so ensures that courts are not just engaged in their own policy balancing about the respective costs of review and repose but instead are faithfully following Congre ss's lead. Here, Congress's standard practice when it's focused on the time for challenging an agency action has been to run the limitations period for that type of claim from the date of the agency action at issue.

Nothing in the APA or Section 2401(a) requires that destabilizing result. In Crown Coat Front Company, this Court explicitly rejected Corner Post's one-size-fits-all definition of ""accrues,"" warning of the hazards of attempting to devise a single accrual rule for all purposes. Instead, the Court explained that to apply the general word ""accrues"" a court has to  consider the particular type of claim at issue and how the practical purposes of a statute of limitations apply in that context. In conducting that necessary analysis, courts should give primary weight to evidence about the accrual rule that Congress itself has adopted when it has specifically focused on other claims of the same type. Doing so ensures that courts are not just engaged in their own policy balancing about the respective costs of review and repose but instead are faithfully following Congre ss's lead. Here, Congress's standard practice when it's focused on the time for challenging an agency action has been to run the limitations period for that type of claim from the date of the agency action at issue. It would, therefore, reasonably have expected courts to follow the same approach when  applying Section 2401(a)'s catch-all statute of limitations to claims under the APA, and because that's what the court of appeals did here, the decision  below should be affirmed.

In asking this Court to reject that settled practice, Corner Post argues that the word ""accrues"" in Section 2401(a) invariably refers to a time at which a specific plaintiff obtains a complete and present cause of action and that every newly formed entity therefore has six years to challenge any prior agency actions that affect its business or other interests, even if those actions occurred decades ago. Nothing in the APA or Section 2401(a) requires that destabilizing result. In Crown Coat Front Company, this Court explicitly rejected Corner Post's one-size-fits-all definition of ""accrues,"" warning of the hazards of attempting to devise a single accrual rule for all purposes. Instead, the Court explained that to apply the general word ""accrues"" a court has to  consider the particular type of claim at issue and how the practical purposes of a statute of limitations apply in that context. In conducting that necessary analysis, courts should give primary weight to evidence about the accrual rule that Congress itself has adopted when it has specifically focused on other claims of the same type. Doing so ensures that courts are not just engaged in their own policy balancing about the respective costs of review and repose but instead are faithfully following Congre ss's lead. Here, Congress's standard practice when it's focused on the time for challenging an agency action has been to run the limitations period for that type of claim from the date of the agency action at issue.

Snyder</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  For decades, the courts of appeals have consistently recognized that the six-year statute of limitations on an APA claim accrues at the time of the challenged agency action, not the time when a particular plaintiff comes within the relevant statute's zone of interests. In asking this Court to reject that settled practice, Corner Post argues that the word ""accrues"" in Section 2401(a) invariably refers to a time at which a specific plaintiff obtains a complete and present cause of action and that every newly formed entity therefore has six years to challenge any prior agency actions that affect its business or other interests, even if those actions occurred decades ago. Nothing in the APA or Section 2401(a) requires that destabilizing result. In Crown Coat Front Company, this Court explicitly rejected Corner Post's one-size-fits-all definition of ""accrues,"" warning of the hazards of attempting to devise a single accrual rule for all purposes. Instead, the Court explained that to apply the general word ""accrues"" a court has to  consider the particular type of claim at issue and how the practical purposes of a statute of limitations apply in that context. In conducting that necessary analysis, courts should give primary weight to evidence about the accrual rule that Congress itself has adopted when it has specifically focused on other claims of the same type. Doing so ensures that courts are not just engaged in their own policy balancing about the respective costs of review and repose but instead are faithfully following Congre ss's lead. Here, Congress's standard practice when it's focused on the time for challenging an agency action has been to run the limitations period for that type of claim from the date of the agency action at issue.

27412,2023.22-1074-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"User fees in my mind, the essence of them is, I'm using something, I should pay for that use. You're using public roads that are going to have to be built because you build this kind of project, you're going to have to use public roads. When I pay a toll, generally, I pay a toll, it's now in New York $10, I can go a block or I can go one exit or I can go 10 exits, I'm paying the same $10. No one's looking at my individual project -- trip and saying you're only using it for a fraction of a moment. You're going to say that comes under the rough proportionality. But it doesn't. What's being judged is the project as a whole. And this is what the government's doing. So I said to you this hasn't really been fleshed out below, but the concept that has to be addressed is what's the essence of a user fee. I personally don't see that as very different in impact. And -- but the question is, when a court is reviewing that, is it reviewing it for reasonableness, proportionality, or is it reviewing it for impact on an individual property? And I don't see how it can be that. So this may be a hybrid, and we may have to look at it someday, but it is not pure one side or the other.","<speaker>Paul J.

If you win on the precise -- on the question on which we granted cert, which is whether there is a total exemption for legislative enactment -- so let's assume for the sake of argument that the Court were to agree with you on that, and so there has to be an application of whatever the test is to legislative enactments. And then there are legislative enactments and there are legislative enactments, and they -- some apply to a very broad category of -- of property, and some apply -- some could apply to a very narrow category of property. And -- and my question is whether you think that the test that applies to a legislative enactment that applies to a category of property should be the same as the one that applies in the permitting process, where there is an individualized determination. So let me give you two examples. You have a law like this that imposes a fee, a -- a -- a particular fee, a set fee, on anybody who builds a tiny house, like 500 square feet. I don't know how many square feet a tiny house has, but a tiny house, okay? Everybody -- they do a study and they figure out that people on average who have these tiny houses have X number of cars and they calculate that.

And I found your reply brief -- well, first of all, the amicus briefs of the states and of the American Planning Association, for example, say in essence, paraphrasing, it would be a total disaster to try to do that on a parcel-specific basis and would really destroy the concept of imposing impact fees for new development. And in your reply brief, I thought you came back on page 16 and said: ""While a fee based on classes of development can survive Nollan/Dolan, a fee schedule premised on a range of fees for different development classes will not necessarily run afoul of Nollan/Dolan.""

Beard II</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The county refused to give George Sheetz a permit to build a home unless he paid a substantial fee to finance public road improvements. He was faced with an impossible choice: the taking of over $23,000 or the ability to use his land. Though the fee went beyond mitigation, he did submit to the fee and paid under protest. After all, the permit was worth far more than the fee. That's the same improper leveraging that led to this Court's rule in Nollan, Dolan, and Koontz that all permit exactions should be subject to heightened scrutiny. Such review is needed to ensure that the government is not committing a taking in the guise of the police power to mitigate for land use impacts. Yet, the lower court refused to apply Nollan/Dolan simply because the fee came from a legislative, preset, generally applicable schedule that the county had adopted. The decision below is as wrong as it is dangerous. First, nothing in the Court's exactions precedents, the Takings Clause, or the unconstitutional conditions doctrine justifies that broad exception. Second, it's a perversion of Nollan and Dolan to say that because an exaction is generally applicable, therefore, it requires no heightened review. The exact opposite is true. Such an exaction only amplifies the risk that the government hasn't tailored its exaction to a project's impacts, and that cries out for Nollan/Dolan review. Finally, upholding the lower court's decision would just invite the government to monetize across the country all of their permit exactions and to preset legislative fees in order to escape heightened review. The exception would swallow the rule. All permit exactions, whether monetary or otherwise, generally applicable or ad hoc, should be subject to Nollan and Dolan to ensure the government doesn't take more than it is entitled to under its police power to mitigate for land use impacts. The Court should reverse and remand with instructions to apply heightened review to the court -- to the county's fee. I look forward to the Court's questions.</text>",2023,coherent

So Justice Kavanaugh has been discussing the sort of core practical problem of how do we figure out when the county has overstepped and gone too far and there must be a limit. And all of that is true, but I guess I'm concerned about the core legal problem that is the threshold question of which test should apply when given the claims that are being made by Mr. Sheetz in this case. And so that takes me back to wondering whether the most straightforward way to win in this case from your perspective is not necessarily to prove that this is a tax or prove that this is, you know, a user fee but to say this is not a taking. We have very clear, very well-established legal principles as to what qualifies as a taking. And whatever this is, I think we can say that since it isn't the kind of dedicated property appropriation that occurs in Nollan, Dolan, and Koontz, that it's not a taking, so this particular formula doesn't apply. Isn't -- isn't that the most straightforward? Like, Justice Gorsuch was -- was starting to investigate your position that this qualifies as a tax.

As the findings below make clear, the programmatic fee in this case does not pay for road improvements generally. It pays for only those improvements necessary to alleviate increased traffic from new development. Neither precedent nor principle supports, much less compels, applying Nollan/Dolan's individualized test to those programmatic fees. In centuries' worth of precedent, this Court has reiterated that governments can charge fees to property owners, such as special assessments to fund public improvements and user fees to fund government services. This Court has always held that those fees, which are indistinguishable from the fee at issue, are not takings. Without that predicate for application of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, Nollan/Dolan cannot apply. More fundamentally, the county's impact fee shares all of the key features with the other property taxes, user fees, and similar property-based charges that this Court has cordoned off from Nollan/Dolan review. It is imposed by the legislature subject to an array of state law requirements and applies to all similar new development in the county based on the legislature's finding that new development creates the need for and will benefit from the road improvements the fee will fund. And, critically, it does not attempt to obtain any dedication of real property. Petitioner would disregard those limiting features and expand Nollan/Dolan to commonplace impact fees. But doing so would have dire consequences for land use planning. Forcing local governments to justify a programmatic fee on a parcel-by-parcel basis would disrupt, if not destroy, their ability to fund capital-intensive infrastructure necessary to serve new development, bringing such development to a grinding halt.

27465,2023.22-1074-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"So I just want to clarify. In your exchange with Justice Gorsuch, who very clearly isolated the question presented, as I read it, the question presented at least as the Petitioner put it forward is whether a permit exaction is exempt from the unconstitutional conditions doctrine simply because it's authorized by legislation. So it seems to me that there is a threshold assumption that the permit exaction would otherwise trigger the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, and the question is, is it exempt from that just because of legislation. So, because there is disagreement about whether it would trigger it to begin with, I would think that to isolate the question presented as -- at a minimum, we would have to expressly preserve the assumption, right? I mean, our -- our holding or our opinion would have to say assuming that a permit exaction of the nature of this one triggers the unconstitutional, that we couldn't not say that, right, in order to just isolate the question presented?","<speaker>Aileen M.

The question in this case is how claims that an employer acted with retaliatory intent are to be proven. The plain text of the statute answers that question. District court actions shall be governed by the burdens of proof in AIR21. AIR21, in turn, places exactly one burden of proof on plaintiff, to show that his protected conduct was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action. The burden then shifts to the defendant to prove that it would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of the protected conduct, in essence, that it did not act with retaliatory intent. The Second Circuit held that the contributing factor element required a showing of retaliatory intent. UBS does not defend that holding, nor could it. UBS instead contends that in addition to showing the contributing factor element, a plaintiff must separately show retaliatory intent. But UBS never grappled with the plain text of the statute, which says that an action shall be governed by the burdens in AIR21. And having now disclaimed any requirement that a plaintiff show animus, UBS never explains what its proposed retaliatory intent element would amount to, other than the second step of the burden-shifting framework, a showing that the employer would not have taken the adverse action in the absence of the protected conduct.

You -- you've reduced it all down to ""discriminate because of,"" what you say is the heart of the statute. But, before the word ""discriminate,"" we have the company may not or ""no company may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in any other manner discriminate."" And the reason why I think that might be important is that if you are right that there is some sort of mens rea that relates to retaliation, I guess I at least would have thought that Congress would write this differently, right? That you would have a statute that would say one may not, comma, you know, purposefully or with retaliatory intent harass, demote, suspend, et cetera. But that's not the way this is written.

But, unlike Bantam and the case that you'll hear next, this is not a typical suit where a speaker challenges government actions affecting its own speech. Instead, two states and five individuals are trying to use the Article III courts to audit all of the executive branch's communications with and about social media platforms. That problem has infected every step of this case. Respondents don't have standing at all because they have not shown an imminent threat that the government will cause a platform to moderate their posts in particular. But the lower courts still reviewed a vast range of speech by different officials to different platforms about different topics at different  times without asking whether it had anything to do with Respondents. And the courts then entered a universal injunction restricting speech about any content posted on any platform by anyone and binding thousands of officials, including presidential advisors speaking to the public and FBI agents trying to protect the nation from foreign threats. Even apart from the Article III problem, that injunction rests on two fundamental legal errors. First, the Fifth Circuit radically expanded the state action doctrine by holding that even concededly non-coercive communications, like the CDC's public health advice, can transform private platforms' editorial choices into state action. And, second, the Fifth Circuit mistook persuasion for coercion. It held that the FBI's communications are inherently coercive because  the FBI is a law enforcement agency, a theory that even Respondents don't defend in this  Court, and it held that White House officials engaged in coercion because they used strong language or referred in a general way to legal reforms in response to press questions.

But, unlike Bantam and the case that you'll hear next, this is not a typical suit where a speaker challenges government actions affecting its own speech. Instead, two states and five individuals are trying to use the Article III courts to audit all of the executive branch's communications with and about social media platforms. That problem has infected every step of this case. Respondents don't have standing at all because they have not shown an imminent threat that the government will cause a platform to moderate their posts in particular. But the lower courts still reviewed a vast range of speech by different officials to different platforms about different topics at different  times without asking whether it had anything to do with Respondents. And the courts then entered a universal injunction restricting speech about any content posted on any platform by anyone and binding thousands of officials, including presidential advisors speaking to the public and FBI agents trying to protect the nation from foreign threats. Even apart from the Article III problem, that injunction rests on two fundamental legal errors. First, the Fifth Circuit radically expanded the state action doctrine by holding that even concededly non-coercive communications, like the CDC's public health advice, can transform private platforms' editorial choices into state action. And, second, the Fifth Circuit mistook persuasion for coercion. It held that the FBI's communications are inherently coercive because  the FBI is a law enforcement agency, a theory that even Respondents don't defend in this  Court, and it held that White House officials engaged in coercion because they used strong language or referred in a general way to legal reforms in response to press questions.

I just want to make sure that that's right because I'm thinking about things you talked about with  -- I think it was Justice Alito, the interchange with the expletives, you  know, we're getting mad, we want answers now, you know, are you, whatever, serious?","<speaker>Brian H. Fletcher</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The government may not use coercive threats to suppress speech, but it is entitled to speak for itself by informing, persuading, or criticizing private speakers. Like Bantam Books, this case should be about that fundamental distinction between persuasion and coercion. But, unlike Bantam and the case that you'll hear next, this is not a typical suit where a speaker challenges government actions affecting its own speech. Instead, two states and five individuals are trying to use the Article III courts to audit all of the executive branch's communications with and about social media platforms. That problem has infected every step of this case. Respondents don't have standing at all because they have not shown an imminent threat that the government will cause a platform to moderate their posts in particular. But the lower courts still reviewed a vast range of speech by different officials to different platforms about different topics at different  times without asking whether it had anything to do with Respondents. And the courts then entered a universal injunction restricting speech about any content posted on any platform by anyone and binding thousands of officials, including presidential advisors speaking to the public and FBI agents trying to protect the nation from foreign threats. Even apart from the Article III problem, that injunction rests on two fundamental legal errors. First, the Fifth Circuit radically expanded the state action doctrine by holding that even concededly non-coercive communications, like the CDC's public health advice, can transform private platforms' editorial choices into state action. And, second, the Fifth Circuit mistook persuasion for coercion. It held that the FBI's communications are inherently coercive because  the FBI is a law enforcement agency, a theory that even Respondents don't defend in this  Court, and it held that White House officials engaged in coercion because they used strong language or referred in a general way to legal reforms in response to press questions. If this Court reaches the merits, it should reaffirm that government speech crosses the line into coercion only if, viewed objectively, it conveys a threat of adverse government action.

The government seems to be arguing here that Bantam Books is the way to go, that Blum is not the right test.

It sounded  like you were articulating different standards depending on  --a different legal standard depending on different factual circumstances. For example, when Justice Kagan gave you the hypothetical of pressure being placed on The New York Times or The Washington Post not to run a particular op-ed, it seemed like you backed off and said, well, significant encouragement wouldn't be enough there because the person who wrote the op-ed can go to another news outlet. You also made the point that this is just different because social media is such a concentrated industry, which is a point that Justice Gorsuch was asking Mr. Fletcher about. So can you clarify?

Does that make sense?","<speaker>J. Benjamin Aguinaga</speaker><text> Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Government censorship has no place in our democracy. That is why this 20,000 -page record is stunning. As the Fifth Circuit put it, the record reveals unrelenting pressure by the government to coerce social media platforms to suppress the speech of millions of Americans. The district court, which analyzed this record for a year, described it as arguably the most massive attack against free speech in American history, including the censorship of renowned scientists opining in their areas of expertise. And the government's levers of pressure are anathema to the First Amendment. Behind closed doors, the government badgers the platforms 24/7, it abuses them with profanity, it warns that the highest levels of the White House are concerned, it ominously says that the White House is considering its options, and it accuses platforms both of playing total Calvinball and of hiding the ball, all to get the platforms to censor more speech. Under this  onslaught, the platforms routinely cave. Now, last month, in the NetChoice cases, the platforms told you that it's  incredibly important that they create their own content moderation policies. But this record shows that they continually depart from those  policies because of unrelenting government pressure. Indeed, as Facebook recently disclosed in an internal email to former UK Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, the reason Facebook did that was ""because we were under pressure by the administration. We shouldn't have done it.""  Now my friend says all this is constitutional because the government has the right to persuade using the bully pulpit. But the government has no right to persuade platforms to violate Americans' constitutional rights, and pressuring platforms in back rooms shielded from public view is not using the bully pulpit at all. That's just being a bully. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2023,coherent

Flynn</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Indian Self-Determination Act requires the Indian Health Service to enter into contracts with tribes to transfer federal health programs that IHS previously carried out for the tribes' benefit. ISDA's basic design is simple. IHS takes the appropriated funds it would have otherwise spent on the federal program and transfers those funds to the tribe in exchange for the tribe's promise to use them to provide the same level of services, and ISDA obligates IHS to add to that core secretarial amount contract support costs to plug specific gaps the secretarial amount does not cover. What the tribes are arguing here is that ISDA also obligates IHS to subsidize the tribes' expenditures of funds that they don't receive from IHS under the contract but, rather, collect from third parties as supplemental revenue. The statutory text and context refute that theory, which would upend how the statute has been administered for 35 years. ISDA's provisions addressing contract support costs say nothing about third-party revenue a tribe may earn. ISDA deals with that separate income stream in other provisions, including one instructing that such income shall be treated as supplemental funding to that in the contract. The tribes' argument that Congress actually intended for such income to determine what IHS pays under the contract would work a sea change in ISDA's scheme by potentially tripling the federal government's contract support cost obligation and eventually transforming what the statute designates as mere support costs into the primary component of contract funding.

And -- and I'm interested in the other side's response to the series of questions that are going on now about that limitation. But I understand that in terms of tribal healthcare, it's about one -third of what is spent by the average American on their own healthcare. So it's not as if al l of this money is bringing us a luxury healthcare spa. It's actually bringing us to a fairly minimal level of healthcare for tribal members. I still don't understand how your interpretation makes any contract support system costs, or many of them, recoverable at all because you seem to be saying that if you're providing services with a -- you have services with a third party like Medicare or Medicaid, why would that then include contracts with a consultant who comes in to do the other services that the contract requires for the government?  There's always third -party contract -- contract supports that are reimbursed by the government. Why is this any different?  They're not providing the service because of Medicaid or Medicare. They're providing the service because of their agreement with the government. This is only a reimbursement. It's not a required service agreement.","<speaker>Caroline A.

What is your principle for limiting that, if there is one?","<speaker>Caroline A. Flynn</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Indian Self-Determination Act requires the Indian Health Service to enter into contracts with tribes to transfer federal health programs that IHS previously carried out for the tribes' benefit. ISDA's basic design is simple. IHS takes the appropriated funds it would have otherwise spent on the federal program and transfers those funds to the tribe in exchange for the tribe's promise to use them to provide the same level of services, and ISDA obligates IHS to add to that core secretarial amount contract support costs to plug specific gaps the secretarial amount does not cover. What the tribes are arguing here is that ISDA also obligates IHS to subsidize the tribes' expenditures of funds that they don't receive from IHS under the contract but, rather, collect from third parties as supplemental revenue. The statutory text and context refute that theory, which would upend how the statute has been administered for 35 years. ISDA's provisions addressing contract support costs say nothing about third-party revenue a tribe may earn. ISDA deals with that separate income stream in other provisions, including one instructing that such income shall be treated as supplemental funding to that in the contract. The tribes' argument that Congress actually intended for such income to determine what IHS pays under the contract would work a sea change in ISDA's scheme by potentially tripling the federal government's contract support cost obligation and eventually transforming what the statute designates as mere support costs into the primary component of contract funding. But there is an even more straightforward reason why the tribes' theory here is wrong. It violates Congress's express command that IHS only reimburse costs that are directly attributable to the tribes' ISDA contract. That prohibition applies notwithstanding any other provision of law and  would independently bar the agency from paying the costs at issue here even if they might otherwise qualify.

IHS takes the appropriated funds it would have otherwise spent on the federal program and transfers those funds to the tribe in exchange for the tribe's promise to use them to provide the same level of services, and ISDA obligates IHS to add to that core secretarial amount contract support costs to plug specific gaps the secretarial amount does not cover. What the tribes are arguing here is that ISDA also obligates IHS to subsidize the tribes' expenditures of funds that they don't receive from IHS under the contract but, rather, collect from third parties as supplemental revenue. The statutory text and context refute that theory, which would upend how the statute has been administered for 35 years. ISDA's provisions addressing contract support costs say nothing about third-party revenue a tribe may earn. ISDA deals with that separate income stream in other provisions, including one instructing that such income shall be treated as supplemental funding to that in the contract. The tribes' argument that Congress actually intended for such income to determine what IHS pays under the contract would work a sea change in ISDA's scheme by potentially tripling the federal government's contract support cost obligation and eventually transforming what the statute designates as mere support costs into the primary component of contract funding. But there is an even more straightforward reason why the tribes' theory here is wrong. It violates Congress's express command that IHS only reimburse costs that are directly attributable to the tribes' ISDA contract. That prohibition applies notwithstanding any other provision of law and  would independently bar the agency from paying the costs at issue here even if they might otherwise qualify.

Nor need the Court establish the exact contours of the discovery rule here. Instead,  it need only hold that Respondents in this case are not entitled to damages for acts that took place more than a decade before they filed suit. And on that basis, this Court should reverse the court of appeals' judgment. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2023,coherent

Those issues were never raised or decided below, and reaching them is not necessary to resolve the circuit split targeted by the Court's actual question presented. Assuming Respondents' claims are timely under the discovery rule, Respondents are entitled to seek damages as a remedy for those claims. Section 507(b) makes no distinction between claims seeking the remedy of damages and claims seeking other forms of rel ief. Section 504 is entitled ""Remedies for Infringement,  Damages, and Profits,"" and it expressly says that a copyright owner is entitled to recover the actual damages suffered by him, any profits of the infringer, or statutory damages for all infringements involved in the action. There is  no damages bar for copyright claims in Title 17. Now Congress has enacted three-year lookback damages bars as narrow exceptions elsewhere in Title 17, but Congress needed to add those as narrow exceptions precisely because there is no damages bar in Title 17 as a general rule. Nor would a judicially created damages bar be permissible. In Petrella, this Court held that if a copyright claim is timely under the statute of limitations, again, as is assumed here, courts are not at liberty to impose equitable-based time limits on the recovery of damages for those claims. Now, to be sure, in Petrella, recovery was limited to infringements committed during the three years before the complaint was filed. But that was because, under a laches case like that one and any other laches case, earlier claims which separately accrue were and will become time-barred under the statute of limitations when the plaintiff doesn't sue on them. That is how the statute of limitations takes account of delay. It bars claims if  they're not brought within three years of when they accrue. But, if a copyright claim is brought within three years of when it accrues and, thus, is timely under the statute of limitations, damages must be available as a remedy.

Is that  the gist of it?,"<speaker>Joe Wesley Earnhardt</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Court reformulated the question presented to set aside debates about the discovery rule. Those issues were never raised or decided below, and reaching them is not necessary to resolve the circuit split targeted by the Court's actual question presented. Assuming Respondents' claims are timely under the discovery rule, Respondents are entitled to seek damages as a remedy for those claims. Section 507(b) makes no distinction between claims seeking the remedy of damages and claims seeking other forms of rel ief. Section 504 is entitled ""Remedies for Infringement,  Damages, and Profits,"" and it expressly says that a copyright owner is entitled to recover the actual damages suffered by him, any profits of the infringer, or statutory damages for all infringements involved in the action. There is  no damages bar for copyright claims in Title 17. Now Congress has enacted three-year lookback damages bars as narrow exceptions elsewhere in Title 17, but Congress needed to add those as narrow exceptions precisely because there is no damages bar in Title 17 as a general rule. Nor would a judicially created damages bar be permissible. In Petrella, this Court held that if a copyright claim is timely under the statute of limitations, again, as is assumed here, courts are not at liberty to impose equitable-based time limits on the recovery of damages for those claims. Now, to be sure, in Petrella, recovery was limited to infringements committed during the three years before the complaint was filed. But that was because, under a laches case like that one and any other laches case, earlier claims which separately accrue were and will become time-barred under the statute of limitations when the plaintiff doesn't sue on them. That is how the statute of limitations takes account of delay. It bars claims if  they're not brought within three years of when they accrue. But, if a copyright claim is brought within three years of when it accrues and, thus, is timely under the statute of limitations, damages must be available as a remedy.

Shanmugam</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  This case presents the question whether a copyright plaintiff can recover damages for acts that allegedly occurred more than three years before the filing of suit. As a straightforward matter of statutory interpretation, the answer to that question here is no. Under the applicable statute of limitations, a civil action must be brought within three years after the claim accrued. A claim accrues when the plaintiff has a complete cause of action. Accordingly, as this Court repeatedly stated in Petrella, a plaintiff can obtain damages for acts of infringement only within three years of filing. And under this Court's understanding of the background discovery rule, a plaintiff is entitled to extend that period only in cases involving fraud. Now faced with those points, Respondents seek to use the rephrased question presented to clear the board of Petitioners' strongest arguments. But that question directs  the parties to address the statute, and statutory construction begins with the text. Respondents eventually joined issue on the text, but the inferences from the other provisions they cite cannot overcome the pl ain meaning of the term ""accrues.""  And even if the statutory text were somehow off the table here, Respondents offer no valid explanation for this Court's statements in Petrella,  and they assume the existence of a broad discovery rule, even in the face of disagreement among the lower courts about the discovery rule's scope. And Respondents do not dispute that if the discovery rule applies only in cases involving fraud, they are not entitled to invoke it. There is no precedent for this Court's resolving a question of statutory interpretation by assuming away the relevant statutory text. At most, the rephrased question p resented assumes the existence of some version of the discovery rule. It does not take sides on the scope of that rule.

Yet, the Fourth Circuit's rule denies that insurer a voice. That rule, which my friends barely defend, violates the text, context, and history of 1109(b). It also defies the practical reality that Chapter 11 cases are, as this Court has recognized, collaborative, working best when all stakeholders come together at the outset to hash things out.

31480,2023.22-976-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas," Mr. Fletcher, how does a machinegun  -- what would I have to do to fire a machinegun?","<speaker>Brian H. Fletcher</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. To fire a rifle fitted with a bump stock, the shooter simply places his trigger finger on the built-in finger ledge and uses his other hand to press the front of the rifle forward. As long as the shooter maintains that steady forward pressure, the rifle will fire continuously until it runs out of bullets, and it will empty a 100-round magazine like the ones used in the Las Vegas shooting in about 10 seconds. Those weapons do exactly what Congress meant to prohibit when it enacted the prohibition on machineguns, and those weapons are machineguns because they satisfy both disputed parts of the statutory definition. First, a rifle with a bump stock fires more than one shot by a single function of the trigger. In common usage today as in 1934, a  function of the trigger happens when some act by the shooter, usually a pull, starts a firing sequence. With a semiautomatic rifle, it fires  one shot for each function of the trigger because the shooter has to manually pull and release the trigger for every shot. But a bump stock eliminates those manual movements and  allows the shooter to fire many shots with one act, a forward push. Now Respondent says that a separate function of the trigger happens every time the trigger on a traditional rifle moves backwards and releases the hammer, even if it moves without any further manipulation by the shooter. But that is inconsistent with contemporaneous usage, does not account for guns with other kinds of triggers, and would make it trivially easy to evade the ban on mach ineguns just by automating the back-and-forth movement of the trigger after the shooter's initial pull. Second, a rifle with a bump stock fires more than one shot automatically, that is, through a self -regulating mechanism. Once the shooter presses forward to fire  the first shot, the bump stock uses the gun's recoil energy to create a continuous back-and-forth cycle that fires hundreds of shots per minute. Now Respondent says that  that cycle is not automatic because the shooter has to keep up  the forward pressure to keep the cycle going. But many traditional machineguns likewise  require the shooter to maintain backward pressure on the trigger to maintain continuous fire. Either way, a single motion both initiates and maintains a multi-shot sequence, and either way, the weapon is a machinegun. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2023,coherent

With a semiautomatic rifle, it fires  one shot for each function of the trigger because the shooter has to manually pull and release the trigger for every shot. But a bump stock eliminates those manual movements and  allows the shooter to fire many shots with one act, a forward push. Now Respondent says that a separate function of the trigger happens every time the trigger on a traditional rifle moves backwards and releases the hammer, even if it moves without any further manipulation by the shooter. But that is inconsistent with contemporaneous usage, does not account for guns with other kinds of triggers, and would make it trivially easy to evade the ban on mach ineguns just by automating the back-and-forth movement of the trigger after the shooter's initial pull. Second, a rifle with a bump stock fires more than one shot automatically, that is, through a self -regulating mechanism. Once the shooter presses forward to fire  the first shot, the bump stock uses the gun's recoil energy to create a continuous back-and-forth cycle that fires hundreds of shots per minute. Now Respondent says that  that cycle is not automatic because the shooter has to keep up  the forward pressure to keep the cycle going. But many traditional machineguns likewise  require the shooter to maintain backward pressure on the trigger to maintain continuous fire. Either way, a single motion both initiates and maintains a multi-shot sequence, and either way, the weapon is a machinegun. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2023,Incoherent

But a bump stock eliminates those manual movements and  allows the shooter to fire many shots with one act, a forward push. Now Respondent says that a separate function of the trigger happens every time the trigger on a traditional rifle moves backwards and releases the hammer, even if it moves without any further manipulation by the shooter. But that is inconsistent with contemporaneous usage, does not account for guns with other kinds of triggers, and would make it trivially easy to evade the ban on mach ineguns just by automating the back-and-forth movement of the trigger after the shooter's initial pull. Second, a rifle with a bump stock fires more than one shot automatically, that is, through a self -regulating mechanism. Once the shooter presses forward to fire  the first shot, the bump stock uses the gun's recoil energy to create a continuous back-and-forth cycle that fires hundreds of shots per minute. Now Respondent says that  that cycle is not automatic because the shooter has to keep up  the forward pressure to keep the cycle going. But many traditional machineguns likewise  require the shooter to maintain backward pressure on the trigger to maintain continuous fire. Either way, a single motion both initiates and maintains a multi-shot sequence, and either way, the weapon is a machinegun. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2023,coherent

The trigger is the device that initiates the firing of the weapon, and the function of the trigger is what that trigge ring device must do to cause the weapon to fire. The phrase ""function of the trigger"" can refer only to the trigger's function. It  has nothing to do with the shooter or what the shooter does to the trigger because the shooter does not have a function. The statute is concerned only with what the trigger does and whether a single function of that trigger produces more than one shot. Second, a bump stock equipped rifle does not and cannot fire more than one shot automatically by a  single function of the trigger because the shooter, in addition to causing the trigger to function, must also undertake additional manual actions to ensure a successful round of bump firing. Everything about the bump firing process is manual. And there is no automating device, such as a spring or a motor, in any of Mr. Cargill's non- mechanical bump stocks. The process depends entirely on human effort and exertion as the shooter must continually and repeatedly thrust the forestock of the rifle forward with his non -shooting hand while simultaneously maintaining backward  pressure on the weapon with his shooting ha nd.

It matter -- what matters is what the trigger or the triggers do inside the gun. A -- an M6 -- back in the day when it was possible to fire the standard military issue rifle, M16, from the 1970s on automatic, my understanding is that the military doesn't even  -- you can't even do that anymore. All you can fire at most is a burst of three shots. But there are two buttons on -- on the -- on the old- time M16. You have to flip the -- well, there are three.

First, a bump stock equipped rifle can fire only one shot per function of the trigger because the trigger must reset after every shot and must function again before another shot can be fired.

Second, a bump stock equipped rifle does not and cannot fire more than one shot automatically by a  single function of the trigger because the shooter, in addition to causing the trigger to function, must also undertake additional manual actions to ensure a successful round of bump firing.

I mean, this is why I said context matters in my view and that we're in the context of a statute in which Congress has given the Board the ability to determine the merits and  -- at least in the first instance, and the ability to make the investigation, to find the facts. And in this context, that body has made a preliminary determination in these 14 cases that an injunction is warranted.

31968,2023.23-367-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Counsel, you mentioned that it's a small number of  --I forget exactly your framing -- that -- that, what, reached the question in court about the  application of the factors?","<speaker>Austin L. Raynor</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  I think the question in this case has narrowed considerably, so I'll just walk through the factors. First, on irreparable harm, in its opening brief, Petitioner fought the idea that the irreparable harm inquiry s hould focus on whether the Board is going to be able to remedy the harm at the end of its proceedings. At page 2 of its reply, it now concedes the focus is on the Board's remedial power. And I understood my friend to further concede that point in her argument this morning. Second, on harm, the question is not whether there is a certainty of harm. The question is whether there's a likelihood of harm. The test used by the Sixth Circuit is reasonably necessary. That's the Ahearn case. We think that's fully consistent with this Court's precedents. And as to whether all discharges count, we agree that not all unlawful discharges necessarily show irreparable harm. The question  that the Board looks at and the question that we think the Court should look at is whether that extinguishes the momentum of the union drive or  impairs it in such a serious way that an order from the Board a year or two down the road won't be able to restart the drive. Second, on public interest and the equities, our basic point here is that when Congress makes a judgment about what is in the public interest, the court cannot override that judgment in weighing the equities at that stage. This is the Oakland Cannabis case. The Court says, if Congress has made a judgment that something is unlawful, you can't basically make that thing lawful at the equities stage by refusing to enforce Congress's judgment. That doesn't mean that in some cases at the preliminary stage, if there's extremely compelling interests on the other side or public interests on the other side, that an injunction will automatically be necessary. But we think that in a case like this one, where Congress has made a judgment in  -- in a run-of -the-mine case, there's only going to be purely private profit -- profit motive interests on the other side, injunctive relief is typically going to be warranted. Again, I think Petitioner concedes  this basic point at page 13 of its reply. It says that courts are not entitled to revise Congress's judgment. Third, that leaves the merits, which I think has been the subject of a lot of discussion this morning. We think that the Court should take into account all relevant context. One piece of context is the statistics that Justice Jackson mentioned. The Board receives 20,000 unfair labor charges every year. It issues 750 complaints. Last year it authorized 14 petitions and filed seven. That's seven out of 20,000. We think that a court can properly take account of that in trying to make a predictive judgment about how the Board is going to come out. This ultimately is a predictive judgment. How is the Board going to come out? What is the likelihood of success before the Board?  And it's relevant that there is  substantial winnowing that goes on before the complaint is filed in district court. I think it's also relevant to note that the Board has approved the Section 10(j) petition. And just to clarify the separation of functions within the agency here, the general counsel is the prosecutorial arm to the Board. The Board members themselves are the adjudicative authority. But the statute, Section 10(j) itself, vests in the Board the power to approve a Section 10(j) petition. So before a 10(j) petition is filed in court, the Board itself has approved it. And that's relevant in making the predictive judgment about how this claim is likely to come out before the Board. The adjudicator has already preliminarily signalled its view of the merits. That doesn't mean the Board has made up its mind. It hasn't seen all the evidence, but that's a relevant consideration for the district court to think about in determining whether there is a likelihood of success on the merits.</text>",2023,coherent

But we think that in a case like this one, where Congress has made a judgment in  -- in a run-of -the-mine case, there's only going to be purely private profit -- profit motive interests on the other side, injunctive relief is typically going to be warranted. Again, I think Petitioner concedes  this basic point at page 13 of its reply. It says that courts are not entitled to revise Congress's judgment. Third, that leaves the merits, which I think has been the subject of a lot of discussion this morning. We think that the Court should take into account all relevant context. One piece of context is the statistics that Justice Jackson mentioned. The Board receives 20,000 unfair labor charges every year. It issues 750 complaints. Last year it authorized 14 petitions and filed seven. That's seven out of 20,000. We think that a court can properly take account of that in trying to make a predictive judgment about how the Board is going to come out. This ultimately is a predictive judgment. How is the Board going to come out? What is the likelihood of success before the Board?  And it's relevant that there is  substantial winnowing that goes on before the complaint is filed in district court. I think it's also relevant to note that the Board has approved the Section 10(j) petition. And just to clarify the separation of functions within the agency here, the general counsel is the prosecutorial arm to the Board. The Board members themselves are the adjudicative authority. But the statute, Section 10(j) itself, vests in the Board the power to approve a Section 10(j) petition. So before a 10(j) petition is filed in court, the Board itself has approved it. And that's relevant in making the predictive judgment about how this claim is likely to come out before the Board. The adjudicator has already preliminarily signalled its view of the merits. That doesn't mean the Board has made up its mind. It hasn't seen all the evidence, but that's a relevant consideration for the district court to think about in determining whether there is a likelihood of success on the merits.</text>",2023,incoherent
31981,2023.23-367-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch," Let me  -- let me see if I can put it this way:  So the district court is supposed to ask likelihood of success on the merits. Is it supposed to ask what I think are the likelihood of success on the merits,  objectively as best I can come up with, as neutral judgment as I can muster?  Or is it  supposed to ask, well, I don't think you're likely to succeed but I think the Board will?  Is that what -- is that -- is that -- that seems to me the delta between the positions here. And, you know, I  -- I --gosh, it's clear to me that your -- you know, your friend's going to win, but the Board's going to rule otherwise.

Raynor</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  I think the question in this case has narrowed considerably, so I'll just walk through the factors. First, on irreparable harm, in its opening brief, Petitioner fought the idea that the irreparable harm inquiry s hould focus on whether the Board is going to be able to remedy the harm at the end of its proceedings. At page 2 of its reply, it now concedes the focus is on the Board's remedial power. And I understood my friend to further concede that point in her argument this morning. Second, on harm, the question is not whether there is a certainty of harm. The question is whether there's a likelihood of harm. The test used by the Sixth Circuit is reasonably necessary. That's the Ahearn case. We think that's fully consistent with this Court's precedents. And as to whether all discharges count, we agree that not all unlawful discharges necessarily show irreparable harm. The question  that the Board looks at and the question that we think the Court should look at is whether that extinguishes the momentum of the union drive or  impairs it in such a serious way that an order from the Board a year or two down the road won't be able to restart the drive. Second, on public interest and the equities, our basic point here is that when Congress makes a judgment about what is in the public interest, the court cannot override that judgment in weighing the equities at that stage.

You know, I mean, where -- where does it end?

Second, on public interest and the equities, our basic point here is that when Congress makes a judgment about what is in the public interest, the court cannot override that judgment in weighing the equities at that stage. This is the Oakland Cannabis case. The Court says, if Congress has made a judgment that something is unlawful, you can't basically make that thing lawful at the equities stage by refusing to enforce Congress's judgment. That doesn't mean that in some cases at the preliminary stage, if there's extremely compelling interests on the other side or public interests on the other side, that an injunction will automatically be necessary. But we think that in a case like this one, where Congress has made a judgment in  -- in a run-of -the-mine case, there's only going to be purely private profit -- profit motive interests on the other side, injunctive relief is typically going to be warranted. Again, I think Petitioner concedes  this basic point at page 13 of its reply. It says that courts are not entitled to revise Congress's judgment. Third, that leaves the merits, which I think has been the subject of a lot of discussion this morning. We think that the Court should take into account all relevant context. One piece of context is the statistics that Justice Jackson mentioned. The Board receives 20,000 unfair labor charges every year. It issues 750 complaints. Last year it authorized 14 petitions and filed seven. That's seven out of 20,000. We think that a court can properly take account of that in trying to make a predictive judgment about how the Board is going to come out. This ultimately is a predictive judgment. How is the Board going to come out? What is the likelihood of success before the Board?  And it's relevant that there is  substantial winnowing that goes on before the complaint is filed in district court. I think it's also relevant to note that the Board has approved the Section 10(j) petition. And just to clarify the separation of functions within the agency here, the general counsel is the prosecutorial arm to the Board. The Board members themselves are the adjudicative authority. But the statute, Section 10(j) itself, vests in the Board the power to approve a Section 10(j) petition. So before a 10(j) petition is filed in court, the Board itself has approved it. And that's relevant in making the predictive judgment about how this claim is likely to come out before the Board. The adjudicator has already preliminarily signalled its view of the merits. That doesn't mean the Board has made up its mind. It hasn't seen all the evidence, but that's a relevant consideration for the district court to think about in determining whether there is a likelihood of success on the merits.</text>",2023,incoherent

Second, on public interest and the equities, our basic point here is that when Congress makes a judgment about what is in the public interest, the court cannot override that judgment in weighing the equities at that stage. This is the Oakland Cannabis case. The Court says, if Congress has made a judgment that something is unlawful, you can't basically make that thing lawful at the equities stage by refusing to enforce Congress's judgment. That doesn't mean that in some cases at the preliminary stage, if there's extremely compelling interests on the other side or public interests on the other side, that an injunction will automatically be necessary. But we think that in a case like this one, where Congress has made a judgment in  -- in a run-of -the-mine case, there's only going to be purely private profit -- profit motive interests on the other side, injunctive relief is typically going to be warranted. Again, I think Petitioner concedes  this basic point at page 13 of its reply. It says that courts are not entitled to revise Congress's judgment. Third, that leaves the merits, which I think has been the subject of a lot of discussion this morning. We think that the Court should take into account all relevant context. One piece of context is the statistics that Justice Jackson mentioned. The Board receives 20,000 unfair labor charges every year. It issues 750 complaints. Last year it authorized 14 petitions and filed seven. That's seven out of 20,000. We think that a court can properly take account of that in trying to make a predictive judgment about how the Board is going to come out. This ultimately is a predictive judgment. How is the Board going to come out? What is the likelihood of success before the Board?  And it's relevant that there is  substantial winnowing that goes on before the complaint is filed in district court. I think it's also relevant to note that the Board has approved the Section 10(j) petition. And just to clarify the separation of functions within the agency here, the general counsel is the prosecutorial arm to the Board. The Board members themselves are the adjudicative authority. But the statute, Section 10(j) itself, vests in the Board the power to approve a Section 10(j) petition. So before a 10(j) petition is filed in court, the Board itself has approved it. And that's relevant in making the predictive judgment about how this claim is likely to come out before the Board. The adjudicator has already preliminarily signalled its view of the merits. That doesn't mean the Board has made up its mind.

I didn't understand how it was work in some -- worked -- how it would work in some of the earlier cases.

The government argues that Guerrero-Lasprilla's holding applies only to common law standards and offers a different test for statutory standards. And while jurisdictional tests are supposed to be simple, the government's fashioned an elaborate and amorphous framework that won't provide clear answers. First, courts should see whether the standard has a common law origin. If so, the government suggests it's probably reviewable but doesn't commit either way. Next, courts should scour current and prior versions of the statute for any hint that Congress wanted the agency to have discretion, even if it later deleted the discretion-conferring language. If that doesn't somehow answer the question, courts should ask whether the standard requires evaluation and fact-weighing. They should then traipse through any version of the U.S. Code that -- that has ever existed looking for similarly worded standards and see if courts have ever labeled those discretionary. Taking these factors together, courts can then deem the standard a discretionary one -- a reviewable mixed question or an unreviewable discretionary one.

32193,2023.22-666-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"-- can I just ask, though, whether Guerrero-Lasprilla is helping us with a particular nuance that I see happening, right? We've said in other scenarios that not all mixed questions are the same. So, even if we assume that Guerrero, as I'll call it, says mixed questions count for questions of law, is it possible that there are certain kinds of mixed questions that Congress intended to include here and other kinds that it didn't? So my example is a scenario in which the defendant or the -- the petitioner is challenging the BIA's own rules with respect to how it applies this extreme and unusual hardship. So you say in your brief the BIA has looked at the statute and it has come up with factors that it says the IJs should be applying when it does this. If someone makes the claim that the BIA's factors are inconsistent with the statute insofar as they're applying it in this way in this case, I guess you could say that's a mixed question perhaps. Maybe it's closer to the question -- a pure question of law, but at least you're -- you're challenging the BIA's interpretation of the statute with respect to the factors that it has created. Justice Barrett has come up with a different kind of scenario where we agree on the facts of this case and we agree on the standards, the factors, that everybody's saying, hooray, BA -- BIA, you have it right with respect to what the IJ is supposed to be looking at, but the claim is that the IJ has not weighed these factors appropriately, that it has put more stock in a certain, you know, segment of it than another, and, Court, we really think you should reweigh it differently. Now that might be a mixed question too, but it seems to me that it's of a different variety. And if we could interpret Guerrera -- Guerrero to be talking about the former and not the latter, maybe it doesn't have to be overruled.","<speaker>Jaime A.

The INA limits review of denials of discretionary relief, but it permits review of questions of law.

The government argues that Guerrero-Lasprilla's holding applies only to common law standards and offers a different test for statutory standards. And while jurisdictional tests are supposed to be simple, the government's fashioned an elaborate and amorphous framework that won't provide clear answers. First, courts should see whether the standard has a common law origin. If so, the government suggests it's probably reviewable but doesn't commit either way. Next, courts should scour current and prior versions of the statute for any hint that Congress wanted the agency to have discretion, even if it later deleted the discretion-conferring language. If that doesn't somehow answer the question, courts should ask whether the standard requires evaluation and fact-weighing. They should then traipse through any version of the U.S. Code that -- that has ever existed looking for similarly worded standards and see if courts have ever labeled those discretionary.

Some of the questions that have been asked this morning are -- seem to be requiring you to establish whether or not Congress can do certain things, can -- you know, what if Congress, you know, delegated the authority to -- to determine a trillion dollars worth of funding and how the agency was going to do it? What if Congress set it up in this way or that way, et cetera? But I sort of thought that the burden was on them to show that Congress can't set up the agency in this way, and the reason I think that is because of the language of the Appropriations Clause and the way in which it seems to give the legislature the prerogative of the purse.

32472,2023.22-448-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson,-- I'm sorry -- where do you get that from? So you said the definition is what now?,"<speaker>Noel J. Francisco</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about checks and balances. One of Congress's most important checks on executive power is its power of the purse. That's why Alexander Hamilton said that the unification of sword and purse was the very definition of tyranny. This case reflects precisely that feared unification. The government agrees that Congress couldn't just authorize the executive branch to spend whatever it wants. But that's effectively what Congress did here, where it authorized the CFPB to spend whatever it deems reasonably necessary in perpetuity, subject only to a cap so high it's almost never relevant, all for the very purpose of making this the most independent agency in American history. If it can do that, then it can authorize the President to spend whatever he deems reasonably necessary as long as he doesn't exceed $10 trillion, and that would work a sea change in the separation of powers. The government makes two basic arguments in response. First, it argues that that hypothetical would be unprecedented. But the CFPB is also unprecedented. Congress has never authorized an agency to pick its own perpetual appropriation, and if it can do that for the CFPB, it can do it for every other agency too. Second, the government points to founding-era fee-for-services agencies like the Post Office and their modern analogues. But none of those can demand whatever they want. Instead, they're limited to what they can collect from the people that they serve and regulate. That's why Congress rejected that model for the CFPB. They thought it made the agency too politically accountable. And if you jump the shark from those to this, then you have blessed a regime in which Congress can authorize the executive branch to spend whatever it wants to fund the entire government. In short, the Court should hold the line where it stands. Otherwise, it will have countenanced the very unification of sword and purse that the Constitution was designed to prevent.

So long as that there's any law that does that, that's consistent with the Appropriations Clause. Now the Solicitor General on rebuttal can clarify whether she thinks that's the correct test that we should apply or whether it's the one that I had previously thought she was advocating, which looks to whether something falls far outside Congress's historical practices.

That's why Alexander Hamilton said that the unification of sword and purse was the very definition of tyranny. This case reflects precisely that feared unification. The government agrees that Congress couldn't just authorize the executive branch to spend whatever it wants. But that's effectively what Congress did here, where it authorized the CFPB to spend whatever it deems reasonably necessary in perpetuity, subject only to a cap so high it's almost never relevant, all for the very purpose of making this the most independent agency in American history. If it can do that, then it can authorize the President to spend whatever he deems reasonably necessary as long as he doesn't exceed $10 trillion, and that would work a sea change in the separation of powers. The government makes two basic arguments in response. First, it argues that that hypothetical would be unprecedented. But the CFPB is also unprecedented. Congress has never authorized an agency to pick its own perpetual appropriation, and if it can do that for the CFPB, it can do it for every other agency too. Second, the government points to founding-era fee-for-services agencies like the Post Office and their modern analogues. But none of those can demand whatever they want. Instead, they're limited to what they can collect from the people that they serve and regulate. That's why Congress rejected that model for the CFPB. They thought it made the agency too politically accountable. And if you jump the shark from those to this, then you have blessed a regime in which Congress can authorize the executive branch to spend whatever it wants to fund the entire government. In short, the Court should hold the line where it stands. Otherwise, it will have countenanced the very unification of sword and purse that the Constitution was designed to prevent.

Petitioner wrongly advocates for an inherently subjective test that divorces the state action inquiry from state law. Petitioner's test will result in uncertainty and self-censorship for this country's government employees despite this Court repeatedly finding that government employees do not lose their rights merely by virtue of public employment. James Freed's Facebook account is the perfect example of the danger of Petitioner's test. Mr. Freed opened a personal Facebook count in -- account in 2008 as a college student at Indiana Wesleyan University. For 12 years, he built up the account to interact with friends, family members, and colleagues to talk about his passions and interests, including his wife, daughter, his dog, his work, and his favorite Bible passages. As he had done for over a decade while operating the account, in 2020, Mr. Freed made a private choice like any other Facebook user could do to block Petitioner and delete Petitioner's comments from the page. After being sued, Mr. Freed deactivated the page and stopped speaking to his family and friends and the public on Facebook because he did not want to lose control over his own speech by the threat of state action. Such self-censorship for government employees will not only have a negative impact on society -- on government employees themselves but as society -- in addition to society as a whole as the voices that may advance knowledge and the search for the truth will be silenced.

Am I thinking about that correctly?","<speaker>Brian Wolfman</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Jatonya Muldrow maintains she was transferred from the Intelligence Division to a different job in the Fifth District because she's a woman. That's sex discrimination, and it's unlawful under the plain terms of Title VII. Title VII bars an employer from discriminating against an employee with respect to the terms, conditions, or privileges of her employment because of the employee's sex. Respondent now concedes that a lateral transfer changes the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. After all, a transferred employee cannot show up the next day and do her old job. Her job tasks have changed, and that's the most basic term of employment. So the only question left is whether transferring an employee because of sex is discrimination against that person. It is. ""Discrimination against"" by its ordinary meaning and under this Court's precedent means worse treatment because of a protected characteristic. With that, statutory analysis is complete, which brings us to what 703(a)(1) does not do. It doesn't require that an employer's conduct cause significant disadvantage, objective material harm, objective tangible harm, or the like. And contrary to the Eighth Circuit's understanding, as this Court observed in Teamsters, Title VII provides for equal opportunity to compete for any job, whether it is thought better or worse than another. The statute prohibits discrimination, period. If an employer transfers an employee because of a protected characteristic, that's discrimination, and it's prohibited by Title VII.

34834,2023.23-108 -t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh," I'm going to press on this. What is innocuous and what is not? And, just as important, how is the official supposed to know ahead of time, oh, the $100 gift certificate's okay, but the larger one's not, or the set of books or the framed photo --","<speaker>Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The federal government needs to ensure the money it appropriates to local governments for public benefits is allocated in a way that maximizes the benefits to its citizens, not the rewards for local officials. Congress, therefore, enacted Section 666 to bar officials from corruptly accepting payments with the intent to be influenced or rewarded in connection with their official duties. Petitioner asks this Court to weaken Section 666's protection for the public fisc by holding that a person does not violate Section 666 when he corruptly solicits a payment with the intent to be rewarded unless he has also agreed to accept the reward beforehand. But that requirement of a beforehand- agreement finds no basis in the statutory text. The plain meaning of ""reward"" readily covers a payment given in return for an official action or decision that is already complete. So a police chief who sends his officers to foil a burglary at a store and then demands the store owner pay him $10,000 for his officers' work, he acts with the intent to be rewarded. A safety inspector who issues a building permit for a dangerous project and then solicits a $30,000 payment acts with the intent to be rewarded. And a mayor who steers a contract for a particular business and then asks that business to pay him $13,000 for the contract acts with the intent to be rewarded, whether or not the contractor agreed to give him the reward before the contract closed. Petitioner's argument to the contrary ignores both the plain meaning of the term ""rewarded"" and the statutory history. In 1984, Congress enacted a flat bar on the acceptance of bribes and gratuities. It was modeled dire ctly on the one in Section 201(c) that applies to federal employees. In 1986, Congress narrowed that bar to carve out a subset of only the most culpable gratuities by adding a corruptly mens rea and an express exception for bona fide salary and benefits paid in the ordinary course of business.
