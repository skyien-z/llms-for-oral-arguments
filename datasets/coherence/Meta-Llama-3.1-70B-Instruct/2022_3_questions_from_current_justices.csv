Blatt</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves a dog toy that copies Jack Daniel's trademark and trade dress and associates its whiskey with dog poop. After a four-day trial, the district court found both infringement and dilution. The Ninth Circuit erroneously reversed both holdings. As to infringement, the Ninth Circuit did not disturb the trial court's finding of likelihood of confusion. It instead reversed by applying an exception to the Lanham Act that the Second Circuit in Rogers versus Grimaldi invented for movie titles. Under Rogers, an expressive work is allowed to confuse as long as the use of a mark is artistically relevant and not explicitly misleading. But the Lanham Act has no exceptions for expressive works. It bars using marks for any goods when likely to cause confusion as to origin, sponsorship, or approval. Artistic relevance has nothing to do with confusion, and both implicit and explicit uses can confuse. Nor does constitutional avoidance justify Rogers. Rogers doesn't plausibly construe any text, and there are no First Amendment issues to avoid. Trademarks are ancient property rights that necessarily restrict speech to protect investment in goodwill and prevent consumer confusion, and parodies can be confusing. Now, as a practical matter, parodies won't confuse when differences in marks, markets, or message, typically ridicule, signal that the brand company didn't make the joke. But absent these features, pervasive copying and trading off a brand's goodwill tends to confuse. And survey results showing consumer confusion indicate that the parodist did too much copying and not enough distinguishing. As to dilution, the Ninth Circuit held that the exclusions for noncommercial use mean noncommercial speech. That holding renders neighboring exclusions superfluous, and it nullifies Congress's decision to limit the parody exclusion to uses other than as a designation of source.

As to infringement, the Ninth Circuit did not disturb the trial court's finding of likelihood of confusion. It instead reversed by applying an exception to the Lanham Act that the Second Circuit in Rogers versus Grimaldi invented for movie titles. Under Rogers, an expressive work is allowed to confuse as long as the use of a mark is artistically relevant and not explicitly misleading. But the Lanham Act has no exceptions for expressive works. It bars using marks for any goods when likely to cause confusion as to origin, sponsorship, or approval. Artistic relevance has nothing to do with confusion, and both implicit and explicit uses can confuse. Nor does constitutional avoidance justify Rogers. Rogers doesn't plausibly construe any text, and there are no First Amendment issues to avoid. Trademarks are ancient property rights that necessarily restrict speech to protect investment in goodwill and prevent consumer confusion, and parodies can be confusing. Now, as a practical matter, parodies won't confuse when differences in marks, markets, or message, typically ridicule, signal that the brand company didn't make the joke. But absent these features, pervasive copying and trading off a brand's goodwill tends to confuse. And survey results showing consumer confusion indicate that the parodist did too much copying and not enough distinguishing. As to dilution, the Ninth Circuit held that the exclusions for noncommercial use mean noncommercial speech. That holding renders neighboring exclusions superfluous, and it nullifies Congress's decision to limit the parody exclusion to uses other than as a designation of source. This Court should give noncommercial use its ordinary meaning, a use not involving the buying and selling of goods. I welcome your questions.</text>",2022,incoherent

Shah</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question presented is whether Congress abrogated sovereign immunity with respect to damages actions against Indian tribes in the Bankruptcy Code. The code provision specifying the governmental units whose immunity is abrogated, Section 101(27), names individually the United States, states, and foreign states, as well as the department's agencies and instrumentalities thereof, followed by a residual clause, ""or other foreign or domestic government."" That definition, like the Bankruptcy Code more broadly, does not refer to Indian tribes specifically, the most obvious and natural means of including them, as Congress has done in every other statute abrogating tribal sovereign immunity. Accordingly, the best construction is that tribes are not included. But this Court need not decide the best construction. All parties agree that the clear statement rule governs, and because of that, the question is whether Congress has unequivocally included tribes so as to abrogate their sovereign immunity.

Shah</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question presented is whether Congress abrogated sovereign immunity with respect to damages actions against Indian tribes in the Bankruptcy Code. The code provision specifying the governmental units whose immunity is abrogated, Section 101(27), names individually the United States, states, and foreign states, as well as the department's agencies and instrumentalities thereof, followed by a residual clause, ""or other foreign or domestic government."" That definition, like the Bankruptcy Code more broadly, does not refer to Indian tribes specifically, the most obvious and natural means of including them, as Congress has done in every other statute abrogating tribal sovereign immunity. Accordingly, the best construction is that tribes are not included. But this Court need not decide the best construction. All parties agree that the clear statement rule governs, and because of that, the question is whether Congress has unequivocally included tribes so as to abrogate their sovereign immunity. In other words, as this Court has framed the inquiry, is there any plausible way to read the provision as omitting tribes? Petitioners easily surmount that bar. The First Circuit majority's reliance on the generic phrase ""other domestic government"" to sweep in tribes and apparently only tribes rests on a syllogistic interpretation of the terms ""domestic"" and ""government"" in isolation. Even if ""other domestic government"" could reasonably be construed to refer to tribes, despite their sui generis nature, the provision as a whole doesn't come close to providing the perfect confidence that this Court requires for abrogation. Indeed, Congress has long treated tribes differently than the governmental entities enumerated in Section 101(27), including under the federal bankruptcy statute preceding the code.

Your argument seems to be saying that any due process claim counts. What about the claim in the companion case, Cochran, that there has been -- that has been abandoned, that the SEC violated her due process rights by failing to follow its own rules and procedures? That's a classic due process claim that, I think, in almost every other agency action we wait until the end of the review process for the Court to look at. So it seems to be that you're saying this is unfair because I have to go through the process. But going through the process is what due process is all about.

23019,2022.21-86-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas,"Would you at least give us your clearest textual argument? As Justice Gorsuch mentioned, you have the FTC Act and you have 1331. Could you make -- could you at least argue textually why there is no jurisdiction as between those two statutes?","<speaker>Malcolm L. Stewart</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It is a longstanding principle of administrative law that courts will not intervene in an ongoing agency proceeding until that proceeding culminates in a rule or order that imposes sanctions or determines legal rights or obligations. Consistent with that principle, the FTC Act review provisions governing adjudications authorize court of appeals review only of the final Commission orders that terminate the proceedings. The APA confirms that this review mechanism is exclusive and further confirms that antecedent steps taken during the adjudications are subject to review on the review of the final agency action. Those provisions, taken together, make clear that district courts have no authority to entertain constitutional challenges to the Commission's conduct of agency adjudications. Axon argues that review of final Commission orders will provide inadequate relief because it will not protect it from the burdens associated with the administrative proceedings themselves.

23051,2022.21-86-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett,"So I have a question about meaningful review, although it -- it overlaps a little bit with the collateral point. So, on page 36 of his brief, Mr. Clement points out that Axon's beef is not that it must pay an invalid fine or should not lose a job on an unconstitutional basis, like the claims in Thunder Basin and Elgin, that the relief that it's seeking, you know, isn't going to get it off the hook from liability altogether for either a constitutional reason or some reason related to the application of the statute to its facts. Now Justice Sotomayor pointed out earlier that even a -- a structural challenge to the agency is a means of escaping from an ultimate order. It's -- it's a challenge that you can make to get out from under it. But I take Mr. Clement's point to be that, listen, the most we get is a do-over. So this isn't just about having to endure the expense and the inconvenience of proceedings before we can ultimately challenge them and get relief. It's that the relief that we get in the end isn't an ultimate out from liability, but it's simply saying, if you want to come after us again, you have to do it in a properly constituted agency.

Robbins</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The key to Spending Clause statutes, this Court said in Arlington Central School District, ""is what the states are clearly told regarding the conditions that go along with the acceptance of federal funds."" Among the most costly conditions that may go along with the acceptance of federal funds is exposure to private litigation under Section 1983. This Court made that precise point in Barnes against Gorman, in which it said with respect to a school that ""without doubt, the scope of potential damages liability is one of the most significant factors a school"" -- or, as in this case, a nursing facility -- ""would consider in deciding whether to receive federal funds."" States are therefore entitled, in our view, to clear notice that they will be subject to such private lawsuits if they expect -- if they accept Spending Clause money. Such a clear notice rule comports with the federalism and separation-of-powers principles at stake in these cases, and it accords as well with the common law treatment of third-party beneficiary claims at the time Section 1983 was enacted. At common law, third parties generally could not sue to enforce government contract rights unless the contract clearly specified that the breaching party would be liable to injured third parties. Because the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act contains no such clear statement, it should not give rise to Section 1983 liability. But, even if a clear notice rule is not required, the two purported rights that Respondent invokes under FNHRA do not give rise to Section 1983 claims. First, FNHRA and its implementing regulations provide a comprehensive suite of remedies, including a more restrictive private remedy that forecloses Section 1983 relief under Rancho Palos Verdes. And on this dispositive point, the U.S. Solicitor General agrees with us. Second, the two rights Respondent invokes are not unambiguously phrased in terms of the persons benefited.

26443,2022.21-806-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas,"Well, I think the problem is that it's one thing to have the contract analogy as a basis. And then, as you play it out, you say: Well, if you -- if you continue that, you say, well, who is this contract between? And that's been the basis. It's the state is receiving the money, for example, under these conditions, so the national government can require them to do certain things. Then the next step would be: Does it also give a right to a third-party beneficiary to vindicate some of those rights? That's the way we have done it. Now you're saying it's okay to have the contract analogy at the formation stage, but you can drop it along the way if it becomes inconvenient on the back end, that is, on the rights vindication stage -- at the rights vindication stage.

Harris</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 2016, Congress established the oversight board and assigned it the critical task of leading Puerto Rico back to fiscal health. Congress enacted a number of protections for the Board. One of them is Section 2126(a) of PROMESA, which gives the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over any and all suits against the Board. But the First Circuit below held that 2126(a) abrogated the Board's immunity, in fact, that it did so for every type of suit, federal and territorial. That decision was wrong and should be reversed. In order to abrogate, a statute must be clear and unmistakable on its face. There is nothing in Section 2126(a) that even comes close. This Court has held many times that jurisdictional provisions do not abrogate because the power to hear a case says nothing about the availability of a defense, and mere textual inferences do not qualify.

But the First Circuit below held that 2126(a) abrogated the Board's immunity, in fact, that it did so for every type of suit, federal and territorial. That decision was wrong and should be reversed. In order to abrogate, a statute must be clear and unmistakable on its face. There is nothing in Section 2126(a) that even comes close. This Court has held many times that jurisdictional provisions do not abrogate because the power to hear a case says nothing about the availability of a defense, and mere textual inferences do not qualify. Separately, CPI has raised the issue of whether Puerto Rico and, therefore, the Board is entitled to sovereign immunity. The Board believes the Court need not reach that issue, but, if it does, the Court has repeatedly held for more than a hundred years that Puerto Rico has immunity. It held that way before Puerto Rico's constitutional assembly in the 1950s, and, since then, it has said that Puerto Rico has a degree of sovereignty -- excuse me, autonomy comparable to a state. CPI's theory that Puerto Rico has immunity only in its own courts would mean that Puerto Rico or its governor or other officials could be sued under Puerto Rico's own law in federal court.

But the government comes back and says, well, but the statute has a reasonable cause provision that, in essence, takes care of people who have reasonable cause for not knowing of the obligation or failing to file the report with the accounts listed.

So the -- the thing that I'm trying to get my mind around is the fact that in 5314 I don't even see the word ""account."" It -- it says -- you know, it refers to persons who make a transaction or maintain a relation. So, first of all, we have no account word in this statute, and then, when I look at the history of it, it appears to me, and you might correct me if I'm wrong, that Section 5314 originally directed the Secretary to require any resident or citizen who engages in any transaction or maintains any relationship to file this record. And, when they amended the statute, they said -- they changed it to the language that exists here but said this is really not a material change. So, if that's kind of how we're looking at it, then I think maybe we're not even being directed by the statute to care so much about the accounts because what Congress was trying to do is give the Secretary information about who was engaged in these kinds of activities, and then the Secretary could go afterwards and ask them for more information. There's that provision about the 25 accounts or whatever, you don't even have to give the information.

I think the essence as set forth in the plain language of the statute is, if you have a relationship, an account, tell me about it.

In other words, you -- you know if a person has one account that they have a relationship for foreign purposes, and there's nothing in the statute that makes clear that Congress intended this statutory provision to be the mechanism by which the United States would get all of the information about the full extent of that person's relationship with any bank. And let me just while I have a moment tell you what really concerns me about your position. You said it's a matter of distinct concern that the United States has with respect to any particular transaction. But it's not illegal, as far as I can understand, for people to have foreign bank accounts. It's not an independent legal problem. And they can structure those accounts in any way they want. So they can put their million dollars in a single account, they can have 10 accounts with, right, however much, you know, $100,000 apiece or whatever, but you're extracting different penalties from them for this purpose based on this totally lawful behavior. It seems to me to make more sense that Congress was talking about wanting to just know who was doing this kind of thing for the purpose of this statute.","<speaker>Matthew Guarnieri</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Bank Secrecy Act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to assess a separate civil penalty for each foreign financial account that a U.S. person fails to report.

Petitioner's reliance on the Dictionary Act is therefore misplaced. The background rules in that Act don't apply if the context of a particular statute indicates otherwise.

The government now agrees. It concedes that the right-to-control doctrine ""could lead to overbroad results that would expand property fraud beyond the definition at common law and as Congress would have understood it."" Instead, the government offers a new and even broader theory of fraud, fraudulent inducement of a transaction. Yet, in the 150 years since the mail fraud statute was enacted, no case of this Court has embraced that theory. This Court should not do so now. First, the Court should not entertain the theory at all. The theory was not the basis for the jury verdict. This Court has held that it can ""not affirm a criminal conviction on the basis of a theory not presented to the jury."" Second, the government not only forfeited but intentionally abandoned a fraud theory treating the contract funds as property. The government superseded the indictment to drop that theory. It proceeded solely on the right to control. And it used that theory to exclude critical defense evidence. Third, the new theory is wrong. The theory dispenses with a quintessential requirement of common law fraud, harm to a traditional property interest if the scheme succeeds. It would radically expand federal law, violate federalism principles, and end-run limits on honest services fraud. And the theory's breadth requires ad hoc patches that contradict black letter law and that even the government does not fully endorse. Instead of wading into those issues, the Court should resolve the question presented, reject the right-to-control theory, and reverse. And because the government has offered no other theory of property fraud below, the Court should direct entry of an acquittal. I welcome the Court's questions. To begin with the right-to-control theory, which is the question presented, the Second Circuit crafted that theory based on non-traditional ideas drawn from a set of cases that did not examine fundamental questions of what property means under the property fraud statutes.

Dreeben</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For decades, the Second Circuit has applied an invalid theory of wire fraud called the right-to-control doctrine. The government now agrees. It concedes that the right-to-control doctrine ""could lead to overbroad results that would expand property fraud beyond the definition at common law and as Congress would have understood it."" Instead, the government offers a new and even broader theory of fraud, fraudulent inducement of a transaction. Yet, in the 150 years since the mail fraud statute was enacted, no case of this Court has embraced that theory. This Court should not do so now. First, the Court should not entertain the theory at all. The theory was not the basis for the jury verdict. This Court has held that it can ""not affirm a criminal conviction on the basis of a theory not presented to the jury."" Second, the government not only forfeited but intentionally abandoned a fraud theory treating the contract funds as property. The government superseded the indictment to drop that theory. It proceeded solely on the right to control. And it used that theory to exclude critical defense evidence. Third, the new theory is wrong. The theory dispenses with a quintessential requirement of common law fraud, harm to a traditional property interest if the scheme succeeds. It would radically expand federal law, violate federalism principles, and end-run limits on honest services fraud. And the theory's breadth requires ad hoc patches that contradict black letter law and that even the government does not fully endorse. Instead of wading into those issues, the Court should resolve the question presented, reject the right-to-control theory, and reverse. And because the government has offered no other theory of property fraud below, the Court should direct entry of an acquittal. I welcome the Court's questions. To begin with the right-to-control theory, which is the question presented, the Second Circuit crafted that theory based on non-traditional ideas drawn from a set of cases that did not examine fundamental questions of what property means under the property fraud statutes.

Feigin</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I could just start with two main points, one about the scope of property fraud generally and the other about how the right-to-control doctrine fits into that. It's always been property fraud to have fraudulent inducement like in this case, where the victim is tricked into paying for something fundamentally different from what he bargained for. Both in their reply brief at Footnote 2 and just now, Petitioner acknowledges that receiving specific property different from what the victim expected, like a horse with a different name, even if it has equal value, can be fraud. To the extent there's daylight between the parties about the substance of what property fraud covers, I think it goes to cases of what I might call pedigree fraud, where there's a lie about the certification of property or important to us would be a case where, for example, someone lies about their eligibility for a veterans preference in contracting. And we would say that that's fraud, and it's always been fraud at common law. And that's exactly the paradigm that this case in which Petitioner and the other defendants schemed to obtain $750 million in Fort Schuyler's funds by rigging the bidding process and lying about it fits. In maintaining that it fits, we're not abandoning the jury's findings under the right-to-control theory. We're explaining how they map on to the more straightforward and traditional elements of property fraud as they have always been understood. And that's, I think, sufficient to confirm -- affirm, I'm sorry -- to confirm that the conviction should be affirmed because I don't really understand on the facts of this case and on the indictment that was submitted and went to the jury how the jury found any difference between the right to control the $750 million and the $750 million itself.

When a reservation is established, that reservation isn't just the land. It's also a right to the timber on the land, a right to the minerals below the surface, and, under Winters, a right to water for the reservation. Each of those rights is a stick in the bundle that makes up the reservation, and when the Navajo Reservation was originally established and later expanded, the Navajo Nation got all of those sticks, and it still possesses them today. There's no dispute about that. The dispute here is about something different, whether the United States owes the Navajo Nation a judicially enforceable affirmative duty to assess the tribe's water needs, develop a plan to meet them, and then carry out that plan by building water supply infrastructure on the reservation. The answer to that question is no. Just as the 1868 treaty didn't impose on the United States a duty to build roads or bridges or to harvest timber or to mine coal, the 1868 treaty didn't impose on the United States a duty to construct pipelines, pumps, or wells to deliver water.

This is not to say that the United States doesn't have a moral and political responsibility to address the Navajo Nation's water needs. As part of the general trust relationship, Congress and the executive have secured for the Navajo Nation hundreds of thousands of acre feet of water and over a billion of -- billions of dollars for infrastructure on the reservation.

Each of those rights is a stick in the bundle that makes up the reservation, and when the Navajo Reservation was originally established and later expanded, the Navajo Nation got all of those sticks, and it still possesses them today. There's no dispute about that. The dispute here is about something different, whether the United States owes the Navajo Nation a judicially enforceable affirmative duty to assess the tribe's water needs, develop a plan to meet them, and then carry out that plan by building water supply infrastructure on the reservation. The answer to that question is no. Just as the 1868 treaty didn't impose on the United States a duty to build roads or bridges or to harvest timber or to mine coal, the 1868 treaty didn't impose on the United States a duty to construct pipelines, pumps, or wells to deliver water. Those affirmative duties aren't part of the treaty. And because the government has never expressly accepted those duties, the Navajo Nation's breach-of-trust claim can't proceed. This is not to say that the United States doesn't have a moral and political responsibility to address the Navajo Nation's water needs. As part of the general trust relationship, Congress and the executive have secured for the Navajo Nation hundreds of thousands of acre feet of water and over a billion of -- billions of dollars for infrastructure on the reservation. And in -- in exercising its own sovereignty, the Navajo Nation is free to develop its own infrastructure projects, including by drilling water to access the cheapest source of water on the reservation, groundwater.

The question today is whether two products, MoneyGram agent checks and MoneyGram teller's checks, fall within that exemption. For many years, the defendant states answered that question ""no."" However, after engaging some creative consultants, they changed their mind. They were right the first time for four separate reasons. First, when Congress adopted that language in 1974, the term ""money order"" referred to specific commercial products labeled ""money order"" and typically sold to unbanked consumers to pay small debts. Neither of those apply to the two disputed instruments here. They're not labeled ""money order,"" and they are sold to consumers with bank accounts who are transferring larger sums of money. Second, the FDA was a surgical fix to this Court's 1972 decision with a key purpose behind it, to prevent the price of small-dollar instruments from increasing due to address collection requirements that states might adopt in reaction to this Court's 1972 decision. That rationale does not apply here, and the two instruments are outside of the FDA altogether. Third, even if you thought these products were within the FDA, the two instruments here fall within the third-party bank check exception.

Neither of those apply to the two disputed instruments here. They're not labeled ""money order,"" and they are sold to consumers with bank accounts who are transferring larger sums of money. Second, the FDA was a surgical fix to this Court's 1972 decision with a key purpose behind it, to prevent the price of small-dollar instruments from increasing due to address collection requirements that states might adopt in reaction to this Court's 1972 decision. That rationale does not apply here, and the two instruments are outside of the FDA altogether. Third, even if you thought these products were within the FDA, the two instruments here fall within the third-party bank check exception. Like all bank checks, they are signed by bank employees, not purchasers. And, fourth, while we believe that our reading is the best reading of the FDA's text, structure, and purpose, we don't deny one could read the statute differently, but importantly, if you found things in equipoise, two things would independently break any tie for us. One is the doctrine of reading statutes to avoid derogation of the common law, and the other is this Court's repeated emphasis on the need for bright-line rules and predictability in this space.

The signature merely indicates that the bank is liable?,"<speaker>Neal Kumar Katyal</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns a piece of statutory text from 1974 in Section 2503, which is found in the blue brief appendix at page 2a.

The question today is whether two products, MoneyGram agent checks and MoneyGram teller's checks, fall within that exemption. For many years, the defendant states answered that question ""no."" However, after engaging some creative consultants, they changed their mind. They were right the first time for four separate reasons. First, when Congress adopted that language in 1974, the term ""money order"" referred to specific commercial products labeled ""money order"" and typically sold to unbanked consumers to pay small debts. Neither of those apply to the two disputed instruments here. They're not labeled ""money order,"" and they are sold to consumers with bank accounts who are transferring larger sums of money. Second, the FDA was a surgical fix to this Court's 1972 decision with a key purpose behind it, to prevent the price of small-dollar instruments from increasing due to address collection requirements that states might adopt in reaction to this Court's 1972 decision. That rationale does not apply here, and the two instruments are outside of the FDA altogether. Third, even if you thought these products were within the FDA, the two instruments here fall within the third-party bank check exception. Like all bank checks, they are signed by bank employees, not purchasers. And, fourth, while we believe that our reading is the best reading of the FDA's text, structure, and purpose, we don't deny one could read the statute differently, but importantly, if you found things in equipoise, two things would independently break any tie for us.

Bronni</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents the problem the FDA was enacted to solve. In Pennsylvania versus New York, this Court concluded that unclaimed financial instruments escheat to a purchaser's state of residence or, if that's unknown, to an issuer's state of incorporation. Because issuers of certain financial instruments rarely kept purchaser addresses, that meant a windfall for an issuer's state of incorporation at the expense of its fellow states. Just two years later, Congress responded to that inequity by enacting the FDA. That statute says that where addresses aren't typically kept for a class of instruments, those instruments escheat to the state of purchase. Now, 50 years later, Delaware claims that it's entitled to the exact same sort of windfall that led to the enactment of the FDA. To justify that, it argues that the FDA doesn't cover instruments that function precisely like other money orders but are marketed differently. But marketing strategies do not define commercial instruments and they don't justify $250 million windfalls. Recognizing the weakness of that argument, Delaware alternatively claims that MoneyGram official checks are excluded from the FDA as third-party bank checks. That argument fares no better because MoneyGram is not a third party as that term was used in 1974, and MoneyGram's official checks are absolutely not bank checks. Nor, for that matter, does Delaware explain why Congress would have chosen to exclude instruments that present precisely the windfall problem that the FDA targeted.

Now, 50 years later, Delaware claims that it's entitled to the exact same sort of windfall that led to the enactment of the FDA. To justify that, it argues that the FDA doesn't cover instruments that function precisely like other money orders but are marketed differently. But marketing strategies do not define commercial instruments and they don't justify $250 million windfalls. Recognizing the weakness of that argument, Delaware alternatively claims that MoneyGram official checks are excluded from the FDA as third-party bank checks. That argument fares no better because MoneyGram is not a third party as that term was used in 1974, and MoneyGram's official checks are absolutely not bank checks. Nor, for that matter, does Delaware explain why Congress would have chosen to exclude instruments that present precisely the windfall problem that the FDA targeted. So it's hardly surprising that all three payment systems experts in this case, including Delaware's own expert, agreed that under any ordinary understanding of the phrase ""third-party bank check,"" MoneyGram official checks are not third-party bank checks.

30648,2022.22O145-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"Just one final question. So Justice Kagan pointed out that Congress might have been intending to cover the field with this statute. And I guess my question is, so what -- what is the field? It seems as though your friend says that really Congress was worried about no addresses, and, as a result, large-money instruments wouldn't fit in the statute because there was an incentive to have addresses. And I understood you to be focusing on Congress's concern about inequitable escheatment, in which case these instruments would be covered. So can you just, as a final word here, talk about what the purpose of this statute is?","<speaker>Nicholas J. Bronni</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents the problem the FDA was enacted to solve. In Pennsylvania versus New York, this Court concluded that unclaimed financial instruments escheat to a purchaser's state of residence or, if that's unknown, to an issuer's state of incorporation. Because issuers of certain financial instruments rarely kept purchaser addresses, that meant a windfall for an issuer's state of incorporation at the expense of its fellow states. Just two years later, Congress responded to that inequity by enacting the FDA. That statute says that where addresses aren't typically kept for a class of instruments, those instruments escheat to the state of purchase. Now, 50 years later, Delaware claims that it's entitled to the exact same sort of windfall that led to the enactment of the FDA.

Martin</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When the government takes property to satisfy a debt and takes more than what is owed, it has a constitutional duty to return or pay for the excess. Here, Geraldine Tyler owed $15,000, which included nearly $13,000 in penalties, interest, and related costs. To satisfy that debt, Hennepin County took Ms. Tyler's former home, which was worth much more than that, and later sold it for $40,000. The county kept all $40,000 for public uses. By taking absolute title to Ms. Tyler's property, including the value that exceeded the debt, the county has taken private property without just compensation. The county could have collected the debt without violating the Constitution by following the traditional common law rule still followed in most states and still followed in Minnesota in nearly every other debt collection circumstance. Under that rule, the county should have taken the property, sold it, paid the debts from the proceeds, and refunded the remainder to Ms. Tyler. Instead, the county took everything. The county apparently does not dispute that Ms. Tyler had a property interest in her former home or in its value. Instead, it asserts that the government may redefine private property by statute. The consequence of that would be an unlimited power to define away private property and to confiscate it to pay debts, no matter how valuable the property or how small the debt. But this Court's takings decisions and hundreds of years of common law, Minnesota's own treatment of debts in nearly every other debt collection circumstance confirm that the county has taken private property for which it must pay just compensation. If not remedied with just compensation, then the confiscation acts as a fine punishing Ms. Tyler for the public offense of failing to timely pay her property taxes.

To satisfy that debt, Hennepin County took Ms. Tyler's former home, which was worth much more than that, and later sold it for $40,000. The county kept all $40,000 for public uses. By taking absolute title to Ms. Tyler's property, including the value that exceeded the debt, the county has taken private property without just compensation. The county could have collected the debt without violating the Constitution by following the traditional common law rule still followed in most states and still followed in Minnesota in nearly every other debt collection circumstance. Under that rule, the county should have taken the property, sold it, paid the debts from the proceeds, and refunded the remainder to Ms. Tyler. Instead, the county took everything. The county apparently does not dispute that Ms. Tyler had a property interest in her former home or in its value. Instead, it asserts that the government may redefine private property by statute. The consequence of that would be an unlimited power to define away private property and to confiscate it to pay debts, no matter how valuable the property or how small the debt. But this Court's takings decisions and hundreds of years of common law, Minnesota's own treatment of debts in nearly every other debt collection circumstance confirm that the county has taken private property for which it must pay just compensation. If not remedied with just compensation, then the confiscation acts as a fine punishing Ms. Tyler for the public offense of failing to timely pay her property taxes. The confiscation of her property should therefore be subject to scrutiny under the Excessive Fines Clause because it goes well beyond compensating the government for any loss. This Court has repeatedly held that an economic sanction that serves in part to punish is a fine within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2022,incoherent

Here, Geraldine Tyler owed $15,000, which included nearly $13,000 in penalties, interest, and related costs. To satisfy that debt, Hennepin County took Ms. Tyler's former home, which was worth much more than that, and later sold it for $40,000. The county kept all $40,000 for public uses. By taking absolute title to Ms. Tyler's property, including the value that exceeded the debt, the county has taken private property without just compensation. The county could have collected the debt without violating the Constitution by following the traditional common law rule still followed in most states and still followed in Minnesota in nearly every other debt collection circumstance. Under that rule, the county should have taken the property, sold it, paid the debts from the proceeds, and refunded the remainder to Ms. Tyler. Instead, the county took everything. The county apparently does not dispute that Ms. Tyler had a property interest in her former home or in its value. Instead, it asserts that the government may redefine private property by statute.

Tripp</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether the fraud exception to discharge includes an additional unwritten requirement that the debtor personally intend or know of the fraud above and beyond whatever it takes to hold her liable for the fraud in the first place. And the answer is no. The words just aren't there. And I'll start with the text. It says that the bankruptcy discharge ""does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt for money to the extent obtained by actual fraud."" So, as this Court put it in Cohen versus de la Cruz, once it is established that specific money is obtained by fraud, then ""any debt arising therefrom is not discharged."" Full stop. The text stops there. There are no more words. And it's -- I think it's undisputed that Petitioner is -- that this case fits the bill. Petitioner obtained my client's money by means of an actual fraud, and she's fully liable for the fraud. It is her fraud under bedrock principles of partnership law. Second, Strang, back at the time when the statute actually said that it needed to be the fraud ""of the bankrupt,"" this Court held that it was the fraud of the bankrupt by relying on the same principles of partnership law that still apply today. So even if those words were added back to the statute, I think we would still win, but without them, this case should be easy. Third, novelty. Petitioner contends that the -- that the debtor must actually intend the fraud without reliance on agency law, vicarious liability, or imputation, and on that rule, the debtor could know, she could know that her -- her -- her partner is a fraudster, profit off the fraud and then turn around and discharge the debt to the victim. No court has ever read the statute that way. Petitioner herself didn't read it that way until after cert was granted, and this Court should not be the first.

But the Reform Act says that the Authority can issue orders to agencies. It gives it no power to issue orders to non-agencies simply because they serve as the representatives or agents or designees of an agency. Indeed, a serious sign of the problem with the Authority's position is that even now, 40 years after the Reform Act was enacted, no one can quite give a consensus justification for the Authority -- for the power the Authority wields. The Authority's arguments have continued to evolve while the union and amici advance novel arguments of their own.

But the amici on the other side say: Well, to do that, to pull back now from the interpretation that's been in place would create a lot of economic dislocation, would really crash the digital economy with all sorts of effects on workers and consumers, retirement plans and what have you, and those are serious concerns and concerns that Congress, if it were to take a look at this and try to fashion something along the lines of what you're saying, could account for.

33974,2022.21-1333-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"So I guess -- I guess I'm thoroughly confused, but let me -- let me try to -- let me try to understand what your argument is. I think that the confusion that I'm feeling is arising from the possibility that we're talking about two different concepts and conflating them in a way. I thought that Section 230 and the questions that we were asking in this case today was about whether there was immunity and whether Google could claim the defense of immunity and that that's actually different than the question of whether whatever it does gives rise to liability. That is, is there liability for aiding and abetting? That's tomorrow's question. And to the extent that you keep coming back to this notion of creating content or whatnot, I feel like we're conflating the two in a way that I'd like to just see if I can clear up from my perspective. Your brief says that the immunity question, Section 230(c)(1)'s text is most naturally read to prohibit courts from holding a website liable for failing to block or remove third-party content. And I read the arguments in your brief and I read what you said about Stratton Oakmont and the sort of background, and so I thought your argument was that the -- that you can only claim immunity, Google, if the claim that's being made against you is about your failing to block or remove third-party content. To the extent we are making a claim about recommendations or doing anything else, any of the, you know, hypotheticals that people have brought up, that's outside of the scope of the statute because, really, the statute is narrowly tailored in a way to protect Internet platforms from claims about failing to block or remove, right? I mean, that's what I thought was happening. All right. So, if that's true, then all the hypotheticals and the questions about are you aiding and abetting if Google, you know, has a priority list or if there's recommendations, maybe, but that's not in the statute because we're just talking about immunity. We're just talking about whether or not you've made a claim for failing to block or remove in this case today related to Section 230.

I mean, part of me -- part of this is all the confusion, I think, that has developed over time about the meaning of the statement in the statute, right? I don't see three elements. I see literally a sentence, and the sentence in my view reads as though they're trying to actually direct courts to not impose publisher liability, strict publisher liability, against the backdrop of Stat -- of Stratton Oakmont.

That's at 34a of the -- of the petition. And your argument is that this neutral tools test isn't in the statute. What is in the statute is a distinction on the one hand between interactive computer service and access software providers and on the other hand content providers. And when we look at that, the access software provider is protected for picking, choosing, analyzing, or even digesting content. So 230 protects an access software provider, an interactive computer service provider, who does any of those things, whether using a neutral tool or not. They -- they can order, they can pick, they can choose, they can analyze, they can digest however they wish and they're protected, even those -- even though those editorial functions we might well think of as some form of content in our First Amendment jurisprudence, but, here, they're shielded by 230. And then your argument, I think, goes that none of that means that they're protected for content generated beyond those functions. And it doesn't matter whether that content is generated by neutral rules or not. That content is actionable whether the -- and one could think of content generated by neutral rules, for example, by artificial intelligence. And another problem also is that it begs the question what a neutral rule is. Is an algorithm always neutral? Don't many of them seek to profit-maximize or promote their own products? Some might even prefer one point of view over another. And because the Ninth Circuit applied the wrong test, this neutral tools test, rather than the content test, we should remand the case for reconsideration under the appropriate standard.

That distinction is drawn in each of the three sections of the statute. First, Section 230(c)(1) is limited to claims that would treat the defendant as a publisher of third-party content. The statute uses ""publish"" in the common law sense. The Fourth Circuit decision in Henderson correctly interprets the statute in that manner and concludes that it involves two elements: the claim must be based on the action of the defendant in disseminating third-party content, and the harm must arise from the content itself. Second, Section 231 -- 230(c)(1) is limited to publication of information provided by another content provider, which is often referred to as third-party content. The statutory defense doesn't apply insofar as a claim is based on words written by the defendant or other content created by the defendant. In some circumstances, the manner in which third-party content is organized or presented could convey other information from the defendant itself, as the government notes. Third, Section 230(c)(1) only applies insofar as a defendant was acting as an Internet computer service. Most entities that are Internet computer services do other things as well. This Court technically is an interactive computer service because of its website. It does other things, as it is doing today. Conduct that falls outside that line of activity is outside the scope of this statute. A number of the briefs in this case urge the Court to adopt a general rule that things that might be referred to as a recommendation are inherently protected by the statute, a decision which would require the Court to then fashion some judicial definition of ""recommendation.""

What would you use as a comparator if -- even if you thought that there might be some vote dilution problems with your plan?,"<speaker>Edmund G. Lacour, Jr.</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Alabama conducted its 2021 redistricting in a lawful, race-neutral manner. The state largely retained its existing districts and made changes needed to equalize population. But that wasn't good enough for the plaintiffs. They argue that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act requires Alabama to replace its map with a racially gerrymandered plan maximizing the number of majority-minority districts. But Section 2 requires an electoral process equally open to all, not one that guarantees maximum political success for some over others. Section 2 does not and cannot obligate Alabama to abandon district lines enveloping the undisputed longstanding community of interest in the Gulf to be replaced by district lines dividing black and white with such racial precision that Alabama could never have constitutionally drawn those lines in the first place. Yet, that is what Alabama has been commanded to do here: redraw its districts to subordinate traditional districting principles to race. The only way to add a second majority-minority district to Alabama's plan is to make race the non-negotiable criterion. Plaintiffs' illustrative plans prove the point. They offer only one way to get that second majority-black district: split Mobile County and divide the Gulf by race. Their new versions of Districts 1 and 2 then stretch the width of the state to group together black voters from disparate areas as far west as Mobile and as far east as the Georgia border. The District Court relied on these outlier plans to invalidate the state's neutrally drawn map, and that was legal error.

34167,2022.21-1086-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan,"Okay. Well, I think what Section 2 is trying to get at is it's trying to ensure equal political opportunities. That's what -- so let me just use that as a segue to my last question, which is that, you know, this is an important statute. It's one of the great achievements of American democracy to achieve equal political opportunities regardless of race, to ensure that African Americans could have as much political power as -- as -- as white Americans could. That's a pretty big deal. And it was strengthened, this statute, in 1982 when this Court interpreted it too narrowly for Congress's taste, and Congress said no, we didn't mean that at all and made this into a results test. Now, in recent years, this statute has fared not well in this Court. Shelby County looks at Section 5 and it says no, Section 5, we don't need that anymore, and one of the things it says is we have Section 2. And then Brnovich comes along, and that's a Section 2 case, and the Court says: You know what, Section 2, they're really dilution claims. You know, this is a denial claim, and -- and so we can construe that very narrowly. But, of course, there's just all these cases that are dilution claims. That's really what Section 2 is about. And now here we are, Section 2 is a dilution claim, this -- you know, the classic Section 2 dilution claim.

I am so, so glad for Justice Barrett's clarification because I had the same thought about what you were arguing, and I'm glad that you clarified that your core point is that the Gingles test has to have a race-neutral baseline or that the -- the first step has to be race-neutral. And -- and what I guess I'm a little confused about in light of that argument is why, given our normal assessment of the Constitution, why is it that you think that there's a Fourteenth Amendment problem? And let me just clarify what I mean by that. I don't think we can assume that just because race is taken into account that that necessarily creates an equal protection problem, because I understood that we looked at the history and traditions of the Constitution at what the framers and the founders thought about and when I drilled down to that level of analysis, it became clear to me that the framers themselves adopted the equal protection clause, the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment, in a race conscious way. That they were, in fact, trying to ensure that people who had been discriminated against, the freedmen in -- during the reconstructive -- reconstruction period were actually brought equal to everyone else in the society. So I looked at the report that was submitted by the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the Fourteenth Amendment, and that report says that the entire point of the amendment was to secure rights of the freed former slaves. The legislator who introduced that amendment said that ""unless the Constitution should restrain them, those states will all, I fear, keep up this discrimination and crush to death the hated freedmen."" That's not -- that's not a race-neutral or race-blind idea in terms of the remedy. And -- and even more than that, I don't think that the historical record establishes that the founders believed that race neutrality or race blindness was required, right? They drafted the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which specifically stated that citizens would have the same civil rights as enjoyed by white citizens. That's the point of that Act, to make sure that the other citizens, the black citizens, would have the same as the white citizens. So they recognized that there was unequal treatment, that people, based on their race, were being treated unequally. And, importantly, when there was a concern that the Civil Rights Act wouldn't have a constitutional foundation, that's when the Fourteenth Amendment came into play. It was drafted to give a foundational -- a constitutional foundation for a piece of legislation that was designed to make people who had less opportunity and less rights equal to white citizens. So with that as the framing and the background, I'm trying to understand your position that Section 2, which by its plain text is doing that same thing, is saying you need to identify people in this community who have less opportunity and less ability to participate and ensure that that's remedied, right? It's a race-conscious effort, as you have indicated.

Lacour, Jr.</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Alabama conducted its 2021 redistricting in a lawful, race-neutral manner. The state largely retained its existing districts and made changes needed to equalize population. But that wasn't good enough for the plaintiffs. They argue that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act requires Alabama to replace its map with a racially gerrymandered plan maximizing the number of majority-minority districts. But Section 2 requires an electoral process equally open to all, not one that guarantees maximum political success for some over others. Section 2 does not and cannot obligate Alabama to abandon district lines enveloping the undisputed longstanding community of interest in the Gulf to be replaced by district lines dividing black and white with such racial precision that Alabama could never have constitutionally drawn those lines in the first place. Yet, that is what Alabama has been commanded to do here: redraw its districts to subordinate traditional districting principles to race. The only way to add a second majority-minority district to Alabama's plan is to make race the non-negotiable criterion. Plaintiffs' illustrative plans prove the point. They offer only one way to get that second majority-black district: split Mobile County and divide the Gulf by race. Their new versions of Districts 1 and 2 then stretch the width of the state to group together black voters from disparate areas as far west as Mobile and as far east as the Georgia border. The District Court relied on these outlier plans to invalidate the state's neutrally drawn map, and that was legal error. Requiring states to scrap neutral plans in favor of plans drawn on account of race set Section 2 at war with itself and with the Constitution.

The district court's unanimous and thorough intensely local analysis did not err in finding that the Black Belt is a historic and extremely poor community of substantial significance. Yet, Alabama's map cracks that community and allows white block voting to deny black voters the opportunity to elect representation responsive to their needs. Rather than argue clear error, Alabama asks us to ignore statutory stare decisis and to rewrite Section 2's text. But the Voting Rights Act is a remedial statute that Congress has twice reenacted since Gingles, and its application here raises no constitutional concerns. That is because Plaintiffs' maps show, consistent with Bartlett, that it is possible to draw maps that look very similar to Alabama's own Board of Education map and that increase opportunities for minority voters, while satisfying traditional and state redistricting criteria at least as well as Alabama's map.

So following up on Justice Barrett's question, setting aside the practicalities of the map-making process, which is basically what you've been focusing on, I think the question is, why should we make the Gingles 1 challengers do that?

And I actually think the question is, why should we require at Gingles Step 1 that a map be drawn in a race-neutral way? And there are two possibilities, right? It's -- one possibility is because that's what Congress would have wanted, but when I read Section 2, I don't see that Congress is requiring race neutrality. In fact, the language beyond equally open is equally open by participation of members in a particular class of citizens in that its members have less opportunity than other members. So it seems as though Congress is authorizing the consideration of race. And then the second question is, all right, why should we do this? Because the Constitution requires some sort of race neutrality, and based on my colloquy with -- with -- with your friend on the other side, I think that the Constitution doesn't require it.

34264,2022.21-1449-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Francisco, I thought that reasonable precautions was fairly clear. The one items that the Board has said are not covered are those where an individual, a union member, is acting in a way that any citizen in the same position would have been held responsible for. So, if you libel somebody -- somebody, it's not just you but any other citizen with no legal obligation to you would be liable. Similarly, no person who -- who's on strike or not can impose intentionally emotional distress, all right? Those are things that categorically we say can't be arguably protected. But, when it comes to destruction of property, I always thought you needed a duty that you're breaching. If an employee goes on strike, their duty to you has ended. I can walk by your plant and the parking lot and see those trucks running. I have no obligation to tell you there's cement in there. I have no obligation to move the truck. I have no obligation to do anything. That's what the employees at that moment, they went on strike. What the government is saying, however, is intentional destruction of property means that I'm taking an affirmative act, not just merely the -- the property perishing on its own.
