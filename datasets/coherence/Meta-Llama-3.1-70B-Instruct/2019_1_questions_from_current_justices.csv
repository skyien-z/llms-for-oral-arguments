Do you have any -- any -- is there any reason for us to assume the opposite of what I gather is a common personal experience?","<speaker>Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1113(2) of ERISA requires that claims for breach of fiduciary duty be brought within three years of when the plaintiff first had actual knowledge of the breach. In 2015, the Respondent, Sulyma, sued, claiming that his retirement plans imprudently overinvested in hedge funds and commodities. But more than three years before that suit was filed, Sulyma received plan disclosures that apprised him of the precise investment allocations he later claimed were imprudent. The Ninth Circuit held that those disclosures would not trigger the three-year bar because Sulyma testified that he had not read them and Intel, therefore, had not established that he had subjective awareness of what was disclosed. The Ninth Circuit was wrong to read the statute to require proof of subjective awareness. Under Section 1113(2), plan participants have actual knowledge of facts that are actually given to them in mandatory ERISA disclosures. That reading respects ERISA's text and the statutory emphasis on -- the structural emphasis in the statute on robust disclosure by plan fiduciaries and private policing by plan participants. The Ninth Circuit's reading upends that balance. It effectively doubles from three to six years the period in which plaintiffs can exploit hindsight bias to second-guess investments, even when plans have fully disclosed the basis for those investments, and it introduces arbitrariness and intractable proof problems. Now one way to bring the correct interpretation of Section 1 -- 1113(2) into focus is by considering the provision as it was originally enacted in 1974, and that's reproduced at pages 38 and 39 of the Blue Brief. The original statute provided that the three-year limitations period would be triggered either when a plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or when the plan filed with the Department of Labor a report that included facts from which a participant could reasonably learn of the facts of the breach. Now, if you read the statute in the way that the Ninth Circuit read it, it doesn't make any sense as it was originally enacted because the three-year period would be triggered in a situation in which the plan disclosed to the Department of Labor the facts that establish the breach but not when the -- when the plan disclosed to the plan participants themselves in mandatory disclosures the very same facts that would trigger it if provided to the Department of Labor. That just doesn't make any sense of the statute. Our reading, in contrast, makes perfect sense of the statute. And if I could, I -- I will start with the text and -- and, I think, try to take a minute and explain why we've got a perfectly reasonable linguistic understanding of Section 1113(2). And it's this: A plaintiff has actual knowledge of facts actually provided to him in mandatory disclosures because, when the plaintiff receives the disclosure, he has, in the word of the statute's past tense ""had,"" but he has in his possession a body -- the body of knowledge contained in the disclosures.

Congress chose to require actual knowledge, not constructive knowledge, before the general six-year limitations period for breach of fiduciary duty claims will be cut in half, and that deliberate decision must be honored. Now a common-sense distinction I think is all that's necessary to resolve this case, but there are important reasons, as I think I heard just -- just now, for why Congress would have made the choice to require actual knowledge here. Setting the bar high before the six-year limitations period will be cut in half reflects what I think is a basic real-world fact. Most people don't read these complicated financial disclosures cover to cover. If you open the Joint Appendix to almost any page, you can see why. These documents are chock-a-block full of dense financial market projections, asset allocations, and other jargon. People with busy lives and with little or no financial investment experience or training are not poring over these disclosures line by line to splice back every statement on the possibility that it might contain the -- the kernel of breach under ERISA. I think it's actually just to the contrary. Because fiduciaries owe an unyielding duty to act in participants' best interests, most people trust that their fiduciaries are not breaching their obligations. Given that real-world understanding, I think it's perfectly sensible that Congress decided not to start the three-year clock running the moment a participant receives these disclosures. And -- and I want to emphasize this, I think it's all the more true because a general six-year period does provide a concrete cutoff for most breach of fiduciary duty claims, and that six-year cutoff is among the shortest general limitations period in ERISA. With Section 1113, Congress set an important balance. Although there's a high bar to trigger the three-year exception, fiduciaries can count on six years being the outside limit. And there's almost no other limitations provision in ERISA that provides this level of protection for defendants.</text>",2019,incoherent

Congress chose to require actual knowledge, not constructive knowledge, before the general six-year limitations period for breach of fiduciary duty claims will be cut in half, and that deliberate decision must be honored. Now a common-sense distinction I think is all that's necessary to resolve this case, but there are important reasons, as I think I heard just -- just now, for why Congress would have made the choice to require actual knowledge here. Setting the bar high before the six-year limitations period will be cut in half reflects what I think is a basic real-world fact. Most people don't read these complicated financial disclosures cover to cover. If you open the Joint Appendix to almost any page, you can see why. These documents are chock-a-block full of dense financial market projections, asset allocations, and other jargon. People with busy lives and with little or no financial investment experience or training are not poring over these disclosures line by line to splice back every statement on the possibility that it might contain the -- the kernel of breach under ERISA. I think it's actually just to the contrary. Because fiduciaries owe an unyielding duty to act in participants' best interests, most people trust that their fiduciaries are not breaching their obligations. Given that real-world understanding, I think it's perfectly sensible that Congress decided not to start the three-year clock running the moment a participant receives these disclosures. And -- and I want to emphasize this, I think it's all the more true because a general six-year period does provide a concrete cutoff for most breach of fiduciary duty claims, and that six-year cutoff is among the shortest general limitations period in ERISA. With Section 1113, Congress set an important balance. Although there's a high bar to trigger the three-year exception, fiduciaries can count on six years being the outside limit. And there's almost no other limitations provision in ERISA that provides this level of protection for defendants.</text>",2019,incoherent

The question that was asked earlier, do you have to understand what the words mean? Or --","<speaker>Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1113(2) of ERISA requires that claims for breach of fiduciary duty be brought within three years of when the plaintiff first had actual knowledge of the breach. In 2015, the Respondent, Sulyma, sued, claiming that his retirement plans imprudently overinvested in hedge funds and commodities. But more than three years before that suit was filed, Sulyma received plan disclosures that apprised him of the precise investment allocations he later claimed were imprudent. The Ninth Circuit held that those disclosures would not trigger the three-year bar because Sulyma testified that he had not read them and Intel, therefore, had not established that he had subjective awareness of what was disclosed. The Ninth Circuit was wrong to read the statute to require proof of subjective awareness. Under Section 1113(2), plan participants have actual knowledge of facts that are actually given to them in mandatory ERISA disclosures. That reading respects ERISA's text and the statutory emphasis on -- the structural emphasis in the statute on robust disclosure by plan fiduciaries and private policing by plan participants. The Ninth Circuit's reading upends that balance. It effectively doubles from three to six years the period in which plaintiffs can exploit hindsight bias to second-guess investments, even when plans have fully disclosed the basis for those investments, and it introduces arbitrariness and intractable proof problems. Now one way to bring the correct interpretation of Section 1 -- 1113(2) into focus is by considering the provision as it was originally enacted in 1974, and that's reproduced at pages 38 and 39 of the Blue Brief. The original statute provided that the three-year limitations period would be triggered either when a plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or when the plan filed with the Department of Labor a report that included facts from which a participant could reasonably learn of the facts of the breach. Now, if you read the statute in the way that the Ninth Circuit read it, it doesn't make any sense as it was originally enacted because the three-year period would be triggered in a situation in which the plan disclosed to the Department of Labor the facts that establish the breach but not when the -- when the plan disclosed to the plan participants themselves in mandatory disclosures the very same facts that would trigger it if provided to the Department of Labor. That just doesn't make any sense of the statute. Our reading, in contrast, makes perfect sense of the statute. And if I could, I -- I will start with the text and -- and, I think, try to take a minute and explain why we've got a perfectly reasonable linguistic understanding of Section 1113(2). And it's this: A plaintiff has actual knowledge of facts actually provided to him in mandatory disclosures because, when the plaintiff receives the disclosure, he has, in the word of the statute's past tense ""had,"" but he has in his possession a body -- the body of knowledge contained in the disclosures.

Alito, Jr.","If the officer in this case had been a state officer and everything else was the same, would the victim have a claim in federal court?","<speaker>Stephen I. Vladeck</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When this case was first argued to this Court two years ago, counsel for Respondent and counsel for the United States were both asked whether Petitioners would have a Bivens remedy if Sergio Hernandez had been standing on U.S. soil when he was shot and killed by Respondent. Both said yes. The question before this Court today is, therefore, whether a Bivens action is nevertheless foreclosed because, in this case, Sergio was standing a few feet to the Mexican side of the border at the time he was shot. For two reasons, we believe that it isn't. First, the fortuity of where a victim is standing does not, in fact, trigger any of the special factors counseling hesitation identified by Respondent or the United States. Most importantly, it is difficult to see how foreign relations could be a special factor precluding a Bivens suit here if it wouldn't have precluded a Bivens claim had Sergio been standing just a few feet away. Moreover, the government's assertion that permitting Petitioners' suit would dramatically undermine U.S. foreign relations and diplomacy is belied by the long history of successful tort claims against federal law enforcement officers, including, as in the Apollon, cases in which the victim was a foreigner harmed on foreign soil, the Court awarded damages, and the diplomatic sky did not fall. Nor does extraterritoriality cut against a Bivens remedy here. Not only was Respondent standing on U.S. soil when he pulled the trigger, but he could not have known in that instant where the bullet would even land, let alone the nationality of anyone it might hit. Second and as importantly, for Petitioners here, it is Bivens or nothing. Neither Respondent nor the United States seriously disputes that the Westfall Act preempts the Texas tort remedy Petitioners could otherwise have pursued, and neither has identified any other alternative remedy for the Petitioners here as opposed to other parties in other cases. All of this goes to why this Court was right in Abbasi when it explained that there are powerful reasons to retain Bivens as a remedy for individual instances of law enforcement overreach. And it goes to why, even though Sergio was standing on Mexican soil when he was shot and killed, this case presents the exact kind of law enforcement overreach that Abbasi had in mind. I think Abbasi is a useful place to begin our analysis because, in that case, not only did this Court suggest that there were still important reasons to retain Bivens in law enforcement contexts, but this Court itself actually preserved and retained one of the plaintiffs' Bivens claims. This Court returned to the district court, rather than dismissing, the prisoner abuse claim against the warden of the MDC. And we think that reflects four of the reasons why retaining Bivens in the law enforcement sphere makes sense. First, as this Court said in Abbasi, it is difficult to contemplate other remedies when individual instances of law enforcement overreach are at play. In those contexts, a damages action after the fact will usually be the only possible legal recourse. It's going to be difficult to bring a claim in advance. Second, the deterrence effect, what this Court has called the core purpose of Bivens, which is to deter individual officers, could quite easily be lost in the absence of remedies in the law enforcement context, unlike in Abbasi, where, as this Court stressed, there were alternative remedies available to the plaintiffs. Third, the historical tradition that we note in our brief, where federal courts and state courts, going all the way back to the founding, routinely imposed tort damages against federal officers acting ultra vires, without suggesting there were separation-of-powers obstacles to doing so, without suggesting that there was anything wrong with the federal courts providing a cause of action in those cases. As opposed to, I think, where the inquiry historically has focused, immunity.

Moreover, the government's assertion that permitting Petitioners' suit would dramatically undermine U.S. foreign relations and diplomacy is belied by the long history of successful tort claims against federal law enforcement officers, including, as in the Apollon, cases in which the victim was a foreigner harmed on foreign soil, the Court awarded damages, and the diplomatic sky did not fall. Nor does extraterritoriality cut against a Bivens remedy here. Not only was Respondent standing on U.S. soil when he pulled the trigger, but he could not have known in that instant where the bullet would even land, let alone the nationality of anyone it might hit. Second and as importantly, for Petitioners here, it is Bivens or nothing. Neither Respondent nor the United States seriously disputes that the Westfall Act preempts the Texas tort remedy Petitioners could otherwise have pursued, and neither has identified any other alternative remedy for the Petitioners here as opposed to other parties in other cases. All of this goes to why this Court was right in Abbasi when it explained that there are powerful reasons to retain Bivens as a remedy for individual instances of law enforcement overreach. And it goes to why, even though Sergio was standing on Mexican soil when he was shot and killed, this case presents the exact kind of law enforcement overreach that Abbasi had in mind. I think Abbasi is a useful place to begin our analysis because, in that case, not only did this Court suggest that there were still important reasons to retain Bivens in law enforcement contexts, but this Court itself actually preserved and retained one of the plaintiffs' Bivens claims. This Court returned to the district court, rather than dismissing, the prisoner abuse claim against the warden of the MDC. And we think that reflects four of the reasons why retaining Bivens in the law enforcement sphere makes sense. First, as this Court said in Abbasi, it is difficult to contemplate other remedies when individual instances of law enforcement overreach are at play. In those contexts, a damages action after the fact will usually be the only possible legal recourse. It's going to be difficult to bring a claim in advance. Second, the deterrence effect, what this Court has called the core purpose of Bivens, which is to deter individual officers, could quite easily be lost in the absence of remedies in the law enforcement context, unlike in Abbasi, where, as this Court stressed, there were alternative remedies available to the plaintiffs. Third, the historical tradition that we note in our brief, where federal courts and state courts, going all the way back to the founding, routinely imposed tort damages against federal officers acting ultra vires, without suggesting there were separation-of-powers obstacles to doing so, without suggesting that there was anything wrong with the federal courts providing a cause of action in those cases. As opposed to, I think, where the inquiry historically has focused, immunity.

Not only was Respondent standing on U.S. soil when he pulled the trigger, but he could not have known in that instant where the bullet would even land, let alone the nationality of anyone it might hit. Second and as importantly, for Petitioners here, it is Bivens or nothing. Neither Respondent nor the United States seriously disputes that the Westfall Act preempts the Texas tort remedy Petitioners could otherwise have pursued, and neither has identified any other alternative remedy for the Petitioners here as opposed to other parties in other cases. All of this goes to why this Court was right in Abbasi when it explained that there are powerful reasons to retain Bivens as a remedy for individual instances of law enforcement overreach. And it goes to why, even though Sergio was standing on Mexican soil when he was shot and killed, this case presents the exact kind of law enforcement overreach that Abbasi had in mind. I think Abbasi is a useful place to begin our analysis because, in that case, not only did this Court suggest that there were still important reasons to retain Bivens in law enforcement contexts, but this Court itself actually preserved and retained one of the plaintiffs' Bivens claims. This Court returned to the district court, rather than dismissing, the prisoner abuse claim against the warden of the MDC. And we think that reflects four of the reasons why retaining Bivens in the law enforcement sphere makes sense. First, as this Court said in Abbasi, it is difficult to contemplate other remedies when individual instances of law enforcement overreach are at play. In those contexts, a damages action after the fact will usually be the only possible legal recourse. It's going to be difficult to bring a claim in advance. Second, the deterrence effect, what this Court has called the core purpose of Bivens, which is to deter individual officers, could quite easily be lost in the absence of remedies in the law enforcement context, unlike in Abbasi, where, as this Court stressed, there were alternative remedies available to the plaintiffs. Third, the historical tradition that we note in our brief, where federal courts and state courts, going all the way back to the founding, routinely imposed tort damages against federal officers acting ultra vires, without suggesting there were separation-of-powers obstacles to doing so, without suggesting that there was anything wrong with the federal courts providing a cause of action in those cases. As opposed to, I think, where the inquiry historically has focused, immunity. Are there reasons in these cases to actually hold the -- the defendant officer harmless, not because there's no cause of action but because he was acting in good faith or, under the modern standard, because he did not violate clearly established rights of which a reasonable officer in his position would have been aware.</text>",2019,coherent
22234,2019.17-1678-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Vladeck, there is one part of the Chief's question you didn't answer. The government's speaking with one voice, and you said the government should. But he's posited a big difference here. The government -- the executive has said this was not a rogue action. This security guard. They've concluded on -- based on what, we don't know -- that this officer was being attacked and that's why he shot. The allegations of this complaint are to the contrary.

Vladeck</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When this case was first argued to this Court two years ago, counsel for Respondent and counsel for the United States were both asked whether Petitioners would have a Bivens remedy if Sergio Hernandez had been standing on U.S. soil when he was shot and killed by Respondent. Both said yes. The question before this Court today is, therefore, whether a Bivens action is nevertheless foreclosed because, in this case, Sergio was standing a few feet to the Mexican side of the border at the time he was shot. For two reasons, we believe that it isn't. First, the fortuity of where a victim is standing does not, in fact, trigger any of the special factors counseling hesitation identified by Respondent or the United States. Most importantly, it is difficult to see how foreign relations could be a special factor precluding a Bivens suit here if it wouldn't have precluded a Bivens claim had Sergio been standing just a few feet away.

Vladeck</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When this case was first argued to this Court two years ago, counsel for Respondent and counsel for the United States were both asked whether Petitioners would have a Bivens remedy if Sergio Hernandez had been standing on U.S. soil when he was shot and killed by Respondent. Both said yes. The question before this Court today is, therefore, whether a Bivens action is nevertheless foreclosed because, in this case, Sergio was standing a few feet to the Mexican side of the border at the time he was shot. For two reasons, we believe that it isn't. First, the fortuity of where a victim is standing does not, in fact, trigger any of the special factors counseling hesitation identified by Respondent or the United States. Most importantly, it is difficult to see how foreign relations could be a special factor precluding a Bivens suit here if it wouldn't have precluded a Bivens claim had Sergio been standing just a few feet away. Moreover, the government's assertion that permitting Petitioners' suit would dramatically undermine U.S. foreign relations and diplomacy is belied by the long history of successful tort claims against federal law enforcement officers, including, as in the Apollon, cases in which the victim was a foreigner harmed on foreign soil, the Court awarded damages, and the diplomatic sky did not fall. Nor does extraterritoriality cut against a Bivens remedy here. Not only was Respondent standing on U.S. soil when he pulled the trigger, but he could not have known in that instant where the bullet would even land, let alone the nationality of anyone it might hit. Second and as importantly, for Petitioners here, it is Bivens or nothing. Neither Respondent nor the United States seriously disputes that the Westfall Act preempts the Texas tort remedy Petitioners could otherwise have pursued, and neither has identified any other alternative remedy for the Petitioners here as opposed to other parties in other cases. All of this goes to why this Court was right in Abbasi when it explained that there are powerful reasons to retain Bivens as a remedy for individual instances of law enforcement overreach. And it goes to why, even though Sergio was standing on Mexican soil when he was shot and killed, this case presents the exact kind of law enforcement overreach that Abbasi had in mind. I think Abbasi is a useful place to begin our analysis because, in that case, not only did this Court suggest that there were still important reasons to retain Bivens in law enforcement contexts, but this Court itself actually preserved and retained one of the plaintiffs' Bivens claims. This Court returned to the district court, rather than dismissing, the prisoner abuse claim against the warden of the MDC. And we think that reflects four of the reasons why retaining Bivens in the law enforcement sphere makes sense. First, as this Court said in Abbasi, it is difficult to contemplate other remedies when individual instances of law enforcement overreach are at play. In those contexts, a damages action after the fact will usually be the only possible legal recourse. It's going to be difficult to bring a claim in advance. Second, the deterrence effect, what this Court has called the core purpose of Bivens, which is to deter individual officers, could quite easily be lost in the absence of remedies in the law enforcement context, unlike in Abbasi, where, as this Court stressed, there were alternative remedies available to the plaintiffs. Third, the historical tradition that we note in our brief, where federal courts and state courts, going all the way back to the founding, routinely imposed tort damages against federal officers acting ultra vires, without suggesting there were separation-of-powers obstacles to doing so, without suggesting that there was anything wrong with the federal courts providing a cause of action in those cases.

So what is your answer to that?","<speaker>Lee Gelernt</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The statute here eliminates any meaningful role for the courts, even to ensure that the statutes and regulations were followed. During the 60-year finality period, Congress also tried to exclude the courts, leaving only that review that was ""required"" by the Constitution. This Court, nonetheless, continued to review legal claims in habeas. It did so while expressly rejecting the government's argument that deportation was not the type of restraint that triggers habeas. It did so critically in cases to review statutory and regulatory limits, even where the Court expressly held that those particular non-citizens lacked constitutional procedural due process rights. It did so where the non-citizen was seeking initial entry, where the non-citizen was in the country illegally, and, most critically in response to what the government said, in cases where the non-citizen was removable and seeking only to challenge the denial of relief from removal. The finality era cases are consistent with the common law and answer each of the government's arguments. The government has cited no common law support. Moreover, the government's undefined meaningful ties test is unworkable. It would also mean that asylum seekers and potentially millions of other unknowns, non-citizens, inside the country could be summarily expelled without any judicial review or without even any administrative review. The Suspension Clause is a check on the political branches. This Court has never before allowed the elimination of judicial review over the legality of deportations. The Court once again should preserve habeas review as it did during the Chinese exclusion era, the finality era, and throughout the country's history. The political branches undoubtedly have enormous power in the immigration area, but the one thing it cannot do, and this Court has never allowed them to do, is remove a check on themselves. So I want to address what I -- what I see as the government's fundamental point now. Their opening brief made very broad arguments about having no habeas at all.

And let me just give the Court two cases. One is Accardi, decided the year after Heikkila v. Barber said the only review under this regime is that which is required by the Constitution. Accardi came into court and said, yes, I'm in the country illegally, but I'd like to apply for a discretionary form of relief that will allow me to stay in the country, suspension of deportation. The Court reviewed it in habeas, found a regulatory violation, and sent the case back for a new hearing. Let me give you one other that involves refugees, Tod v. Waldman. They came to this country seeking initial entry. The general admissibility rule was you had to be literate. The Jewish refugees in that case said: But I'm -- we are refugees; therefore, we can stay, notwithstanding being illiterate. The Court found that that was true on the merits and sent the case back for a new hearing. The critical conceptual point and the reason those cases are right -- and I think the government will concede this when they get up on reply -- is that the predicate for removing someone is both you have to find that they are removable and you have to find that the CFI process was conducted legally and they were legally denied the forms of relief to which they were applying in the CFI process.

This Court, nonetheless, continued to review legal claims in habeas. It did so while expressly rejecting the government's argument that deportation was not the type of restraint that triggers habeas. It did so critically in cases to review statutory and regulatory limits, even where the Court expressly held that those particular non-citizens lacked constitutional procedural due process rights. It did so where the non-citizen was seeking initial entry, where the non-citizen was in the country illegally, and, most critically in response to what the government said, in cases where the non-citizen was removable and seeking only to challenge the denial of relief from removal. The finality era cases are consistent with the common law and answer each of the government's arguments. The government has cited no common law support. Moreover, the government's undefined meaningful ties test is unworkable. It would also mean that asylum seekers and potentially millions of other unknowns, non-citizens, inside the country could be summarily expelled without any judicial review or without even any administrative review. The Suspension Clause is a check on the political branches. This Court has never before allowed the elimination of judicial review over the legality of deportations. The Court once again should preserve habeas review as it did during the Chinese exclusion era, the finality era, and throughout the country's history. The political branches undoubtedly have enormous power in the immigration area, but the one thing it cannot do, and this Court has never allowed them to do, is remove a check on themselves. So I want to address what I -- what I see as the government's fundamental point now. Their opening brief made very broad arguments about having no habeas at all. What they've retreated to now is, well, you were found inadmissible, you're in the country illegally, and you're only challenging relief, and no finality era addresses that. That's absolutely wrong. And let me just give the Court two cases. One is Accardi, decided the year after Heikkila v. Barber said the only review under this regime is that which is required by the Constitution. Accardi came into court and said, yes, I'm in the country illegally, but I'd like to apply for a discretionary form of relief that will allow me to stay in the country, suspension of deportation. The Court reviewed it in habeas, found a regulatory violation, and sent the case back for a new hearing. Let me give you one other that involves refugees, Tod v. Waldman. They came to this country seeking initial entry. The general admissibility rule was you had to be literate. The Jewish refugees in that case said: But I'm -- we are refugees; therefore, we can stay, notwithstanding being illiterate. The Court found that that was true on the merits and sent the case back for a new hearing. The critical conceptual point and the reason those cases are right -- and I think the government will concede this when they get up on reply -- is that the predicate for removing someone is both you have to find that they are removable and you have to find that the CFI process was conducted legally and they were legally denied the forms of relief to which they were applying in the CFI process. You may not remove a person until the CFI process is concluded. The government will -- I think, has never disputed and will concede again that Mr. Thuraissigiam could not be removed based just on the inadmissibility.

Congress was also concerned, however, for -- about the possibility for delay and abuse of the asylum system if every time such a clearly inadmissible alien sought asylum. What it did then was to provide for a three-tiered administrative screening system to first determine whether the alien had a credible fear -- fear of persecution. Respondent contends that the Suspension Clause requires a fact-laden judicial review of the negative fear -- credible-fear determination made in that screening process. Congress, however, while it preserved habeas corpus, tailored it to the special circumstances of expedited removal by limiting it to whether the alien is eligible for expedited removal and whether such an order was entered. Congress's judgment that that approach was necessary for the control of immigration and control of the borders is entitled to great weight and it is consistent with the Suspension Clause. First, Congress has repeatedly said that an alien seeking admission is entitled only to the procedures Congress has provided. And it has held for more than 100 years that Congress may vest the determination of whether an individual alien is excludable in an executive officer. Indeed, it said that a determination by such an officer acting within his jurisdiction is due process for purposes of the Constitution. And when such an order is issued under this system, that expedited removal order establishes the government's right to detain him. A fortiori, that is true when what -- when you have a situation involving an inadmissible alien who seeks review of a negative screening determination for possible relief from removal, notwithstanding his inadmissibility.</text>",2019,coherent

This Court rejected that idea over a hundred years ago in Cromwell and Davis, and as this Court unanimously made clear more recently in Taylor v. Sturgell, the preclusive effect of a judgment is determined by two doctrine: Issue preclusion, which forecloses relitigation of issues actually litigated and resolved, and claim preclusion, which forecloses successive litigation of the very same claim. Applying these long-established principles, the proper rule is a defendant is free to argue any previously unresolved defense it may have to new claims. This rule is right for three reasons: First, it follows from this Court's precedent, including Cromwell, Davis, and Taylor. Second, the rule is easy to administer as courts and litigants are accustomed to applying these bedrock principles of issue and claim preclusion. Third, it's fair and protects due process interests. To be clear, we are not arguing that defenses may never be barred under existing law. Issue preclusion could bar a previously resolved defense. And previously unresolved defenses cannot be raised in the context of a judgment enforcement action or as a claim in an action collaterally attacking a prior judgment.

This Court rejected that idea over a hundred years ago in Cromwell and Davis, and as this Court unanimously made clear more recently in Taylor v. Sturgell, the preclusive effect of a judgment is determined by two doctrine: Issue preclusion, which forecloses relitigation of issues actually litigated and resolved, and claim preclusion, which forecloses successive litigation of the very same claim. Applying these long-established principles, the proper rule is a defendant is free to argue any previously unresolved defense it may have to new claims. This rule is right for three reasons: First, it follows from this Court's precedent, including Cromwell, Davis, and Taylor. Second, the rule is easy to administer as courts and litigants are accustomed to applying these bedrock principles of issue and claim preclusion. Third, it's fair and protects due process interests. To be clear, we are not arguing that defenses may never be barred under existing law. Issue preclusion could bar a previously resolved defense. And previously unresolved defenses cannot be raised in the context of a judgment enforcement action or as a claim in an action collaterally attacking a prior judgment. But none of these circumstances are present here. As the Second Circuit held in the first appeal in this case, Marcel I, Marcel is pursuing new claims as it seeks relief for alleged subsequent infringement.

That decision did not violate the APA for two reasons. First, it's not subject to judicial review. The rescission simply ended a previous non-enforcement policy whereby the Department agreed to not enforce the INA against hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens. But the decision whether or not to enforce the law is committed to the agency's unreviewable discretion, unless a statute restricts it. And nothing in the INA requires the Department, a law enforcement agency, to not enforce the law. Second, the decision to end this non-enforcement policy was eminently reasonable.

Further, Section 314 itself instructs the director to look beyond that section in making the institution determination in at least two ways. First, subsection (b) instructs the director to ""determine whether to institute an inter partes review under this chapter."" And more expressly, subsection (a) tells the director to consider the patent owner's response in determining whether to institute review. And Section 313 says the patent owner in that response can present reasons explaining why the petition fails to meet any requirements of the chapter. In other words, the text of the statute makes clear that the institution determination occurs under Section 314 based on the prerequisites in the entire chapter. And because subsection (d) provides the institution determination cannot be judicially reviewed, the agency's application of those prerequisites located elsewhere in the chapter cannot be appealed, including Section 315(b).

But if the land goes with the -- the assignment of the management authority for the trail, then you have the circumstance that a lot of western national parks: Sequoia, Yosemite, others, there are now ribbons throughout those national parks that belong to the Forest Service and that would be at least open to pipeline development. So while you might thwart a pipeline here, you -- it's not a costless -- it's not a zero-sum gain. You're going to invite pipelines elsewhere. Now, you might tell me nobody is seeking a pipeline there, but that's not a very good answer, is it? So on what account, I guess I'm asking, would a rational Congress have opened up western national parks to development like this?","<speaker>Anthony A.

There may be all sorts of very good environmental reasons why this pipeline shouldn't be built. And those, I take it, are involved in the other issues in the case, but do you have more than a ""gotcha"" argument? Do you -- I mean, and -- and sometimes they work, but if you fit these statutes together, this is what they say, and you can't get out of it, but do you really have an argument that this is what Congress intended when it adopted the statutes on which you rely?","<speaker>Anthony A. Yang</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether the Trails Act converts all federal, state, and private lands traversed by the Appalachian Trail into lands administered by the Park Service. It does not. The Act simply charges the Secretary of the Interior with overall administration of a trail. It repeatedly distinguishes between the agency administering the trail and the land managing agencies administering the land. The Park Service thus coordinates -- or -- agencies and organizations responsible for their own segments of the trail, and informs certain trail-wide responsibilities, but the land managing agencies ultimately -- ultimately take care of the trail on their lands. If a tree falls on Forest lands over the trail, it's the Forest Service that's responsible for it. You don't call the nine Park Service employees at Harpers Ferry and ask them to come out and fix the tree. Respondents' theory is inconsistent with the Act and would dramatically change the national trail system. Respondents, for instance, argue that the trail is land and it's administered by the Park Service. So their position is that the entire trail is federally administered -- a federally administered area of land. But if you look at page 14a, this is Section 1246(h)(1), it requires that the Secretary shall encourage states to operate, develop, and maintain portions of such trails -- and this is scenic trails -- located outside the boundaries of federally-administrated areas. If they're right, there is no thing, nothing, outside the -- the trail outside the federally-administrated areas because the trail is a federally-administered area. Their reading cannot be right. Second -- it would also dramatically increase -- dramatically change the trail system by transferring vast amounts of land into the National Park Service, which the Park -- the Park System, which the Park Service administers and regulates to conserve the natural environment. Not only would TVA's two hydroelectric dams be put in the system; nearly a thousand miles of the Forest Service lands, more than a dozen towns, including Hanover, New Hampshire and Dartmouth College, which crosses straight through, numerous bridges over rivers, including the bridge over the Hudson near West Point, over 600 roads, a hundred interstates and other highways.

That attempt is futile because when a man is discriminated against for being gay, he is discriminated against for not conforming to an expectation about how men should behave. Finally, the possibility that some employers, but not the employers here, may have policies of denying employment opportunities both to gay men and to lesbians does not change the unlawfulness of what was alleged by the employees here. Labeling those policies under an umbrella phrase like ""sexual orientation discrimination"" cannot hide the fact that such an employer is a double discriminator.

25663,2019.17-1618-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch,What is your response to the two-comparator problem we've been discussing and the fact that at least one contributing cause appears to be sex?,"<speaker>Pamela S. Karlan</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a employer fires a male employee for dating men but does not fire female employees who date men, he violates Title VII. The employer has, in the words of Section 703(a), discriminated against the man because he treats that man worse than women who want to do the same thing. And that discrimination is because of sex, again in the words of Section 703(a), because the adverse employment action is based on the male employee's failure to conform to a particular expectation about how men should behave; namely, that men should be attracted only to women and not to men. There is no analytic difference between this kind of discrimination and forms of discrimination that have been already recognized by every court to have addressed them. For example, discrimination against men who are effeminate rather than macho. Like the discrimination here, that discrimination is because of non-conformity with an expectation about how men should behave. The attempt to carve out discrimination against men for being gay from Title VII cannot be administered with either consistency or integrity.

The Sixth Circuit's decision upholding A.M.T.'s return to Italy rests on an erroneous definition of habitual residence. The Sixth Circuit held that A.M.T.'s parents could share an intent to raise A.M.T. in Italy even if they had no meeting of the minds.

Tellingly, neither Taglieri nor the United States defends the Sixth Circuit's habitual residence standard. They instead urge this Court to adopt an amorphous, all relevant circumstances inquiry.

Florida's law is an aberration. The question here is whether Congress intended convictions under such an aberrational law to support the extreme sentencing enhancement of up to life in prison under ACCA. The answer is no for a variety of reasons. First, the state offense provision presents a list of generic crimes which all include a mens rea element. Second, the text of the state offense provision itself implies a mens rea element irrespective of any generic offense analysis. Third, Congress described the qualifying state offenses by tracking almost verbatim the language of the federal drug trafficking statute. Congress used the same terms and even in the same order as the federal statute. We know that when Congress transplants language from one legal source to another, the language carries the old soil with it. And here the old soil includes a mens rea element. While tracking the federal statute, Congress used the term ""involving"" to sweep in similar crimes described with different terminology, such as promoting, producing, or furnishing a controlled substance. And Florida uses the term ""sale,"" which we agree comes under the umbrella of the term -- the federal term, ""distribution."" Finally, since Congress legislates against the background of the common law even in the sentencing context, the requirement for prior convictions for felony offenses itself carries a presumption of mens rea for all the serious drug offenses, federal and state, and shows moreover that the state predicate provision is offense-driven and not based upon discrete conduct or activities.

First, what is your understanding of how the affirmative defense works under Florida law?

And, Number 2, related to what Justice Sotomayor was asking you, forget about Florida law for a moment. The word ""involves"" I think we would both agree is a pretty broad word. Right? Everything in the world pretty much involves everything else, at some level of connection. And what do we do about the fact that this statute would, at least possibly, capture a state law that had a draconian penalty for delivering a drug without knowing what it is?

Petitioner's contrary approach would require courts to construct a complete generic version of each offense based on a 50-state survey of laws from three decades ago and then compare that generic analogue to a particular state's offense at a particular moment in time to see if they match in every respect. That approach has proven challenging enough for the enumerated offenses in (B)(ii) like burglary, which were well established and relatively consistent in 1986. It would be even more challenging for state drug trafficking crimes, which in 1986 were comparatively new and varied in multiple material ways. And it would increase the risk of arbitrary sentencing disparities arising from variation in ancillary aspects of state law, like which bore the burden of persuasion on the knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance. In clause (A)(ii), Congress chose a much simpler approach that asked just two questions. Did the state offense involve one of these activities and, for possession, a specified intent? And did it carry a maximum sentence of at least ten years? And that mirrors the federal provision in (A)(i). Under that straight-forward approach, Petitioner's convictions clearly qualify. And that approach cuts through the variation and uncertainty in state law, like the questions that have arisen this morning about Florida law, and instead uses a broad range of conduct, plus this ten-year maximum penalty threshold to filter out and screen out low-level state offenses.

Alito, Jr.","If Congress had before it when it drafted this provision of ACCA these two models, the federal model where the prosecution has to prove that guilty knowledge of the nature of the substance, and the Florida model, which differs only in that the defendant has to raise this as a -- an affirmative defense, has to say I didn't know that it was an illegal substance, Congress would think there's enough difference between those two models to say that only the former is included and not the latter?","<speaker>Richard M. Summa</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mr. Shular has prior convictions for drug offenses lacking the mens rea element necessary to distinguish between blameworthy and otherwise innocent conduct. In 1986, one state, North Dakota, had dispensed with the element of guilty knowledge for its drug trafficking crimes. Today, Florida is the only state lacking a guilty knowledge element. Florida's law is an aberration. The question here is whether Congress intended convictions under such an aberrational law to support the extreme sentencing enhancement of up to life in prison under ACCA. The answer is no for a variety of reasons. First, the state offense provision presents a list of generic crimes which all include a mens rea element. Second, the text of the state offense provision itself implies a mens rea element irrespective of any generic offense analysis. Third, Congress described the qualifying state offenses by tracking almost verbatim the language of the federal drug trafficking statute. Congress used the same terms and even in the same order as the federal statute. We know that when Congress transplants language from one legal source to another, the language carries the old soil with it. And here the old soil includes a mens rea element. While tracking the federal statute, Congress used the term ""involving"" to sweep in similar crimes described with different terminology, such as promoting, producing, or furnishing a controlled substance. And Florida uses the term ""sale,"" which we agree comes under the umbrella of the term -- the federal term, ""distribution."" Finally, since Congress legislates against the background of the common law even in the sentencing context, the requirement for prior convictions for felony offenses itself carries a presumption of mens rea for all the serious drug offenses, federal and state, and shows moreover that the state predicate provision is offense-driven and not based upon discrete conduct or activities. That's a summary of our argument, but I can be more specific. Here we have a phrase ""manufacturing, distribution, possession with intent to manufacture or distribute a controlled substance."" This phrase incorporates well-known drug trafficking crimes under the federal code. And virtually identical language is used to describe the -- the -- the drug trafficking crime -- crimes under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act.

He calls up the one person he thinks is his friend and he says, I'm thinking of killing myself.

It doesn't mention aiding and abetting. Congress knows how to use those words when it wants to. The words it did use are much broader. ""Encourage"" or ""induce,"" used together, cover every form of influence and persuasion, as this Court said in the Electrical Workers case.

So, if the statute is read as written, which we think it should be, it is substantially overbroad. The second point, however -- and I think this was pointed up effectively in Justice Gorsuch's question -- is that even were this Court to rewrite this law as a solicitation provision -- and we don't think it can -- it would still be overbroad. And that is because there is no historical tradition, going back to 1791 or since, supporting a categorical exclusion from the First Amendment for solicitation of non-criminal conduct. All of the government's common law examples, going back to Sir Edward Coke and Sir Matthew Hale, all involve solicitation of crime, per Justice Breyer's question. Professor Volokh explains this, and he explains why that's the case, because solicitation offenses fall within the traditional exception of speech integral to a crime. There is no dispute, however, that nothing my client did encouraged or even solicited anyone to commit a crime. So, Justice Breyer, were the Court to read the statute in the way that Your Honor suggested -- although I don't think that's a fair reading of what Congress did -- but, if the Court were to rewrite it that way, the judgment of acquittal would still have to be affirmed because there is no suggestion that any of my client's -- the people that she encouraged were ever encouraged to commit a crime or did commit a crime.</text>",2019,coherent

29520,2019.19-67-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"-- what in reading this statute would give an average person notice of all of the limitations you're suggesting to us? Because I read ""encourage or induce an alien to come, enter, or reside in the U.S., knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such coming to, entry, or residence is or will be in violation of law,"" seems to me that all of the examples that were raised earlier, the hospital that's treating a child with -- an illegally present child with a disease, the church who provides worship to illegal aliens, all of the other examples that were given on their face to the common reader of those words would be a violation of the statute.","<speaker>Eric J. Feigin</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent acknowledges that in the context of a criminal law, the terms ""encourage"" and ""induce"" can refer solely to acts that facilitate or solicit unlawful activity. That's the meaning that they have in the context of this criminal law. There's no reason to reach out and give them a vastly more expansive interpretation simply to strike the statute down. Prohibitions on facilitating or soliciting unlawful activity have existed since before the founding and are perfectly constitutional. Interpreting this law to be unconstitutionally overbroad would deviate from that tradition and directly contradict the canon of constitutional avoidance. Historical understanding and practice confirm that Congress didn't use these familiar criminal law terms to enact a novel and broad ban on speech. Predecessors to this statute have been on the books since the late 19th Century, and this provision has existed in substantially its current form for decades. Yet, Respondent and her amici have identified no actual instances in which the statute has been applied to protected First Amendment activity or any concrete documented instances of chilling speech. The absence of such evidence isn't just happenstance, and it doesn't just reflect long-standing executive self-restraint. It's because the statute isn't aimed at speech, and it certainly doesn't encompass substantial amounts of it. To the extent that it could be applied to protected speech, that can be handled through the normal mechanism of as-applied First Amendment challenges in those cases. This isn't such a case because Respondent's own activity of fraudulently inducing aliens to pay her for a false path to lawful permanent residence isn't protected by the First Amendment, and she is not entitled to the last resort remedy of overbreadth invalidation that the Ninth Circuit on its own initiative reached out to impose. That's particularly so because she was convicted of an offense that required the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that she acted for the purpose of financial gain.

The FDIC takes a different approach, although exactly what that approach is has changed somewhat over the course of this litigation.

But, in this Court, the government has abandoned any defense of the Bob Richards rule, and as our opening brief explains, that rule fails every test this Court has established for the creation of federal common law and contravenes the tax laws themselves. Instead, the government advocates a brand-new rule, one that it's never pressed in the lower courts, and that, to our knowledge, no court has ever adopted. But this rule suffers from an even more basic flaw than Bob Richards itself. It simply assumes the answer to the very ownership question at issue. The government's argument starts from the premise that where a parent has agreed to pay its subsidiary the amount of a tax refund, the subsidiary has been vested with ""ultimate entitlement to the refund itself."" That assumption serves as the load-bearing pillar of the government's entire argument. Yet, it has no basis in state law. The government disclaims any argument it's grounded in federal law, and it can't even find footing in the -- in the Ninth Circuit's 1973 Bob Richards decision. Starting with state law, it's simply not the case that where a parent agrees to pay its subsidiary the amount of a refund, the subsidiary necessarily has any property rights in the refund itself.

Second, the parties here agree that, under the express terms of their contract, when the IRS paid the $4 million tax refund at issue in this case, the bank was entitled to receive that amount within 10 business days. So given those two undisputed facts, the refund is headed within 10 days to the bank and the bank is the taxpayer that generated the refund in the first place, ask yourself: Why would these parties have intended to make UWBI the equitable owner of the tax refund and left the bank as nothing more than an unsecured creditor? Especially when, if the parties had made that type of arrangement, they would very likely have violated the Federal Reserve Act. The answer is they didn't. Every relevant provision of the contract shows that the parties intended to make the bank the owner of the refund and to make UWBI an agent. First, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, the parties specified that UWBI would act as an agent on behalf of the subsidiaries. That's the language of their contract. Second, they said further that the essence of their agreement, the core logic of the agreement, was that the bank ought to be treated as a separate taxpayer and UWBI should be ""merely an intermediary with the IRS."" That type of language, ""agent,"" ""mere intermediary,"" that is exactly what you would expect to find in a contract if what the parties really wanted to get across was that when UWBI collects a tax refund like this one from the IRS, it does not acquire equitable title to it. The parties then went on to specify the duties that UWB had -- UWBI has as an agent. They said that if the bank incurs a loss, it --</text>",2019,incoherent

Reich</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question presented in this case is what body of law courts should apply to determine ownership of consolidated tax refunds. In our view, the answer to that question is straightforward. Courts should apply state law. That's the body of law that virtually always governs property rights disputes in our federal system, and, here, the political branches have not displaced that traditional area of state power either by statute or by federal regulation. The FDIC takes a different approach, although exactly what that approach is has changed somewhat over the course of this litigation. In the lower courts, the FDIC advocated a rule of federal common law known as the Bob Richards rule, which holds that ownership of a tax refund presumptively resides with the subsidiary whose losses gave rise to that refund. That's the rule the FDIC has advocated for decades, and that's the rule the Tenth Circuit applied below. But, in this Court, the government has abandoned any defense of the Bob Richards rule, and as our opening brief explains, that rule fails every test this Court has established for the creation of federal common law and contravenes the tax laws themselves. Instead, the government advocates a brand-new rule, one that it's never pressed in the lower courts, and that, to our knowledge, no court has ever adopted. But this rule suffers from an even more basic flaw than Bob Richards itself. It simply assumes the answer to the very ownership question at issue. The government's argument starts from the premise that where a parent has agreed to pay its subsidiary the amount of a tax refund, the subsidiary has been vested with ""ultimate entitlement to the refund itself."" That assumption serves as the load-bearing pillar of the government's entire argument. Yet, it has no basis in state law. The government disclaims any argument it's grounded in federal law, and it can't even find footing in the -- in the Ninth Circuit's 1973 Bob Richards decision. Starting with state law, it's simply not the case that where a parent agrees to pay its subsidiary the amount of a refund, the subsidiary necessarily has any property rights in the refund itself.

In short, states determine how to select electors and ensure that they meet the relevant requirements and perform their duties as assigned. This means, under Green, that states can oversee bribery as an incident as a power to appoint. This must include the power to remove an elector without requiring a full criminal trial. Under my friend Mr. Lessig's position, as a practicality, bribed electors would cast ballots and illegal votes. In this case, the State prevented Mr. Baca from casting a legal ballot, just like it's an illegal ballot if you don't sign it here in Colorado. As this Court explained in Ray, the purpose and history of the Twelfth Amendment reflected the reality that electors acted as pledged agents for their political parties. And the history of such pledges should be given great weight. As to Justice Ginsburg's point about the importance of enforcing a pledge requirement, it's worth noting people rely on such pledges, which are taken voluntarily. And as Justice Scalia explained in the Inter Tribal Council case, voting requirements would be of little value if not enforced. In the almost 70 years since Ray, states have continued to enact laws to enforce elector pledges. Congress has consistently deferred to the states' plenary authority, and no court other than the Tenth Circuit below has invalidated a pledge binding law. Mr. Chief Justice, I would welcome your questions.</text>",2019,incoherent

Is there anything that Mr. Lessig said with which you disagree?","<speaker>Jason Harrow</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about a tradeoff between flexibility and rigidity. The State's rule is too rigid, and that rigidity could come at a steep cost. The State's binding law has no exception. If a candidate dies between the popular vote and the vote of the electors, there is no exception. If a candidate has a stroke, there is no exception. If there's widely recognized fraud or bribery by the candidate, no exception. If there will be a tied electoral vote and a potentially deadlocked House, no exception. The law is rigid. Electors vote for the winner of the popular vote in the State or -- well, there is no or, Your Honors. That's the only option. That rigidity has no place in our constitutional universe. If something goes awry in this coming election or any other, the framers thought that electors could vote with discretion, and the Twelfth Amendment didn't change that. More recently, the Twentieth Amendment's framers, when they analyzed these contingencies, recognized even 150 years after the framing that electors still had discretion and electors could and should use it in the case of death of a candidate. This shows that, given the current system of presidential selection by an Electoral College, there must be times when electors and only those electors are best placed to act in the interest of country. Your Honors, the states have a problem with the idea of an Electoral College and they want to write it out. They make no bones about it. They haven't so far today. And perhaps we would be better off without indirect election, because its months-long, multi-step process of presidential selection presents some risk of instability no matter who wins this case. But until we have an Article V amendment, the vote of real humans called presidential electors isn't going away.

Second, in 1991, Congress amended Title VII to provide for a motivating factor standard but did not amend Section 1981 to provide the same, even though it amended Section 1981 in other respects at the same time. This all but conclusively shows that Section 1981 requires but-for causation, as this Court concluded in Gross and Nassar, with respect to the ADEA and the retaliation provisions of Title VII.

Second, in 1991, Congress amended Title VII to provide for a motivating factor standard but did not amend Section 1981 to provide the same, even though it amended Section 1981 in other respects at the same time. This all but conclusively shows that Section 1981 requires but-for causation, as this Court concluded in Gross and Nassar, with respect to the ADEA and the retaliation provisions of Title VII. And, third, it is -- if the Ninth Circuit is affirmed, it would be vastly easier to recover damages under Section 1981's judicially implied cause of action than under any express cause of action actually enacted by Congress under any federal antidiscrimination law. And, thus, affirming the Ninth Circuit would effectively mean that Section 1981 would completely displace the carefully tailored regime that Congress has devised in Title VII to govern employment discrimination cases.

Second, in 1991, Congress amended Title VII to provide for a motivating factor standard but did not amend Section 1981 to provide the same, even though it amended Section 1981 in other respects at the same time. This all but conclusively shows that Section 1981 requires but-for causation, as this Court concluded in Gross and Nassar, with respect to the ADEA and the retaliation provisions of Title VII. And, third, it is -- if the Ninth Circuit is affirmed, it would be vastly easier to recover damages under Section 1981's judicially implied cause of action than under any express cause of action actually enacted by Congress under any federal antidiscrimination law. And, thus, affirming the Ninth Circuit would effectively mean that Section 1981 would completely displace the carefully tailored regime that Congress has devised in Title VII to govern employment discrimination cases.

After a trial, the district court ruled Act 620 unconstitutional, finding no material differences between this case and Whole Woman's Health. On burdens, it found that Act 620 would leave Louisiana with just one clinic and one doctor providing abortions. At the same time, it found that Act 620 would do nothing for women's health. In reversing the district court's decision, the Fifth Circuit committed two fundamental errors. First, it usurped the role of the district court and disregarded nearly all of its factual findings. Second, the Fifth Circuit accepted legal arguments that this Court rejected four years ago. Nothing, however, has changed that would justify such a legal about-face. In fact, even more medical organizations have joined the AMA and ACOG to say that admitting privileges impose barriers to abortion with no benefit to patients and that this impact is not state dependent. Finally, the state's eleventh-hour objection to third-party standing runs up against still more binding precedent. The Court squarely held in Craig versus Boren that such objections are waiveable, and the state deliberately and strategically waived the issue in the district court. And even if the state could get past waiver, denying standing here would contradict decades of this Court's precedent in numerous areas of the law.

Assuming -- we assume, because it's logical, okay, the woman who lives 300 -- there is going to be some woman who lives 330 miles away, who's going to say that's an unusually long period of time for me to have to drive and then drive back the same day. All right? But putting or -- or the next day. Putting that aside, where is there a conflict between that woman and the doctor? If that woman is going to take the position that this law unduly burdens me, what's the potential conflict? She's going to come in and say you doctors could get credentialing so I really shouldn't sue? You doctors haven't really made an effort so I really shouldn't sue? What sane woman who's a plaintiff is going to have a conflict with a doctor who wants to protect her rights by doing what they can to comply with the law, or not, but their interests are not misaligned, they want to achieve the same holding, that this law unduly burdens her right to abortion. The -- I -- I -- I'm -- I don't see a conflict with that.","<speaker>Julie Rikelman</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about respect for the Court's precedent. Just four years ago, the Court held in Whole Woman's Health that the Texas admitting privileges law imposed an undue burden on women seeking abortions. The Louisiana law at issue here, Act 620, is identical to the Texas law and was expressly modeled on it. After a trial, the district court ruled Act 620 unconstitutional, finding no material differences between this case and Whole Woman's Health. On burdens, it found that Act 620 would leave Louisiana with just one clinic and one doctor providing abortions. At the same time, it found that Act 620 would do nothing for women's health. In reversing the district court's decision, the Fifth Circuit committed two fundamental errors. First, it usurped the role of the district court and disregarded nearly all of its factual findings. Second, the Fifth Circuit accepted legal arguments that this Court rejected four years ago. Nothing, however, has changed that would justify such a legal about-face. In fact, even more medical organizations have joined the AMA and ACOG to say that admitting privileges impose barriers to abortion with no benefit to patients and that this impact is not state dependent. Finally, the state's eleventh-hour objection to third-party standing runs up against still more binding precedent. The Court squarely held in Craig versus Boren that such objections are waiveable, and the state deliberately and strategically waived the issue in the district court. And even if the state could get past waiver, denying standing here would contradict decades of this Court's precedent in numerous areas of the law.

But the point about executive privilege cases is not that it's burdensome. I mean, the critical factor is to weigh the interests that a president has in communicating with advisors on official matters, often about national security, often about military matters, and -- and -- and the need for confidentiality in that, and that's why the Nixon standard was developed, not because of generalized ideas about burdensomeness, which can be dealt with in other ways.

You know, we've had the cases this morning and this case and they are in many respects very similar in -- on -- in the case of the subpoena itself, they're identical, but I think in other respects they're really quite different. The separation of powers case this morning involved entities in an ongoing relationship, the House and the President. And issues of this sort, although always very important, come up with some regularity. There's often disputes between the White House and Congress over documents, and almost always they're -- they're worked out because each of those branches have authorities and powers that affect each other. You know, if the Senate asks for documents from the White House and the White House doesn't give them, then the Senate says, well, we're going to, you know, take our time confirming your nominees and -- and back and forth. But, with respect to local prosecutors, you don't have that ongoing relationship. So the possibility of working something out is -- is far less evident, and, if you're doing that, the -- the stakes are -- well, it's just a little more difficult because there isn't that ongoing relationship.

That, in the words of the Court, slices the case too thin. Rather, an immediately appealable order is determined by considering the larger process at issue and whether the order is final by examining whether it alters the status quo and fixes the rights and obligations of the parties.

So how can we decide this case without deciding whether, when we say something is immediately appealable, we really mean it has to be appealed at that time?","<speaker>James K. Lehman</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 28 U.S.C. Section 158 provides that district courts shall have jurisdiction to hear appeals from final order of bankruptcy judges entered in cases and proceedings referred to bankruptcy judges under Section 157. The order in this case merely determined where the parties would litigate Ritzen's contract claim. Under Section 158, such an order is not a final order entered in a case or proceeding. As this Court determined just four terms ago in Bullard versus Blue Hills Bank, the fact that an order disposes of a proceeding is not, despite what -- despite what Respondent and the government contends, the test for determining finality. That, in the words of the Court, slices the case too thin. Rather, an immediately appealable order is determined by considering the larger process at issue and whether the order is final by examining whether it alters the status quo and fixes the rights and obligations of the parties. In Bullard, the relevant process was the plan confirmation process. Here, the relevant process is the claims adjudication or the claims allowance process under Chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code. As in Bullard, the order here did not resolve the larger process. It did not alter the status quo, nor did it fix the obligations of the parties. On the contrary, it simply continued the automatic stay so the underlying claim would proceed in bankruptcy court. In arguing otherwise, Respondent and the government badly misperceived the role of the automatic stay in bankruptcy cases. The automatic stay is not itself one of the substantive processes of bankruptcy. It is a utility provision that supports the operation of these other processes. In fact, it was Jackson who argued that Ritzen's motion for relief triggered the claims adjudication process, claiming the stay motion constituted an informal proof of claim. Such an order changes little and, in the words of this Court, does not alter the status quo or fix the rights and obligations of the parties. Contrary to what the government has represented in its brief, Section 158 was not actually enacted in 1978. In fact, Section 158 was enacted in 1984.

Number two, can't something be part of a proceeding and yet be different from the -- one -- two claims can come in one proceeding, right, and we often have compulsory counterclaims, for example.

That has been the established understanding of the judicial review provisions of the INA since this Court's 1963 decision in Foti against INS. And Congress incorporated that same understanding into Section 1252 when it enacted IIRIRA in 1996. Now the specific claims at issue here arise under the Convention Against Torture, but CAT claims are no different in this regard.

In reaching this conclusion, the Third Circuit deployed what I believe is a false dichotomy, what the Third Circuit described on the one hand as an occurrence rule and on the other hand a common law discovery rule. And in the view of the Third Circuit, if a -- Congress deploys in a statute a so-called occurrence rule, a common law discovery rule is presumed to be displaced. The Third Circuit cited no decision of this Court in setting forth this dichotomy between an occurrence rule and a common law discovery rule. The analysis is at page 6 of the appendix. That conclusion of the Third Circuit is also in opposition to this Court's decision in 1918 in the Exploration case, which is discussed at length in our brief and the briefs of the other parties. There, that is, I think, fairly characterized as an occurrence rule. The statute in Exploration ran from the date of issuance of a land patent. So that was a date certain tied to facts.
