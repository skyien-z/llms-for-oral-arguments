Francisco</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court and the Board have long recognized that the intentional destruction of an employer's property in the course of a labor dispute is not protected concerted activity. That's why steelworkers can't walk out in the middle of a molten iron pour. It's why federal security guards can't leave their posts in the middle of a terrorist threat. It's why a ferryboat crew can't drive their boat out into the middle of the river and abandon ship. And it's why in this very case the government agrees that the conduct alleged in this complaint isn't even arguably protected. The more substantial question then is, who gets to decide whether the facts alleged in the complaint are true? The state court or the Board? This Court answered that question in Bill Johnson's. If the facts alleged aren't even arguably protected, then the court decides the facts. If the allegations are true, it can award relief. And if they're not, the claim fails, either because it's preempted or because it fails under state law. This division of authority makes sense. Garmon held that the Board's interests in ensuring a uniform legal interpretation of the statute is sufficient to override the state's interests in adjudicating state tort claims, but it doesn't have a similar interest in resolving the facts. So, if the complaint alleges clearly unprotected conduct and the only issue is whether those allegations are true, the state court gets first crack at resolving the facts. That's probably why in this very case the regional director didn't even file his complaint until after the Washington Supreme Court's decision, instead of at the outset, which, under the union's view, would have prevented four years of wasteful litigation.

There are both legal and practical reasons for so holding, and contrary to what Mr. Francisco has said, I don't think the Bill Johnson's decision stands in the way of that. If I could start with the legal reasons, the first and most important legal reason is this Court's decision in Longshoremen against Davis. In that case, the Court said that Garmon preemption is established when the party asserting preemption presents evidence from which the Board could reasonably conclude that the conduct is protected. And it separated that from a separate basis for establishing preemption; namely, the party can offer a legal interpretation that the Board could reasonably accept. So I think that decision pretty squarely establishes that the Board is meant to resolve factual as well as legal disputes. And that's consistent with the structure of the statute. If you look at Sections 10(e) and 10(f) of the National Labor Relations Act, those provisions say that the Board makes factual findings to be resolved under the substantial evidence standard. That suggests that Congress wanted the Board to make these factual decisions as well as the legal ones. And as for the practical reasons, if the state court gets the law wrong, then it won't be finding the right facts. In other words, if it misunderstands what the Board's precedents require in a particular area, then it may focus on immaterial facts or ignore the material facts.

Now Mr. Francisco says that the Bill Johnson's decision supports his position, and I don't think that's right. The issue in Bill Johnson's is, under what circumstances can someone be punished simply for bringing a lawsuit? A Bill Johnson's claim is analogous to a malicious prosecution claim. It's a claim that you've brought a baseless charge for a retaliatory reason.

There are both legal and practical reasons for so holding, and contrary to what Mr. Francisco has said, I don't think the Bill Johnson's decision stands in the way of that. If I could start with the legal reasons, the first and most important legal reason is this Court's decision in Longshoremen against Davis. In that case, the Court said that Garmon preemption is established when the party asserting preemption presents evidence from which the Board could reasonably conclude that the conduct is protected. And it separated that from a separate basis for establishing preemption; namely, the party can offer a legal interpretation that the Board could reasonably accept. So I think that decision pretty squarely establishes that the Board is meant to resolve factual as well as legal disputes. And that's consistent with the structure of the statute. If you look at Sections 10(e) and 10(f) of the National Labor Relations Act, those provisions say that the Board makes factual findings to be resolved under the substantial evidence standard. That suggests that Congress wanted the Board to make these factual decisions as well as the legal ones. And as for the practical reasons, if the state court gets the law wrong, then it won't be finding the right facts. In other words, if it misunderstands what the Board's precedents require in a particular area, then it may focus on immaterial facts or ignore the material facts.

That's because a serious expression of an intent to cause unlawful physical violence directly causes life-changing harms and does not contribute to the marketplace of ideas, regardless of what the perpetrator was thinking. Requiring specific intent in cases of threatening stalkers would immunize stalkers who are untethered from reality. It would also allow devious stalkers to escape accountability by insisting that they meant nothing by their harmful statements. This matters because threats made by stalkers terrorize victims and for good reason. Ninety percent of actual or attempted domestic violence murder cases begin with stalking. The court below followed this Court's teachings from Watts and Black that context is critical in evaluating what constitutes a true threat. The robustness of an objective, context-driven inquiry means that this test won't criminalize a joke taken the wrong way, political advocacy, or hyperbole. It thus protects statements that contribute to the marketplace of ideas. In this case, C.W. reasonably perceived that Counterman's threatening stalking conveyed a serious expression of an intent to cause unlawful physical violence. The First Amendment does not protect threats like these in either the criminal or the civil context. And the standard is, indeed, the same by this Court's precedents in both.

Don't need you. F off permanently""; others of those emails suggesting pretty strongly that he is watching the person, ""Only a couple of physical sightings,"" ""Was that you in the white Jeep?""

35440,2022.22-138-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas,"Just one quick question, Mr. Feigin. Where does this recklessness standard come from?","<speaker>John P. Elwood</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has long held that because of the importance of free speech in our country, categorical exceptions to the First Amendment's prohibition on content regulations must be well defined and narrowly limited, and speech cannot be exempted without proof of a long-settled tradition of subjecting that speech to regulation. The State has not come close to meeting its burden of showing a long-settled tradition of punishing true threats without proof the speaker knew that his statement would cause fear. In the face of early cases and treatises showing the central importance intent played in speech prosecutions and threat prosecutions specifically, Colorado cannot cite even a single decision holding that subjective intent is irrelevant. The best it can do is cite cases that were silent about the required intent in the face of unambiguous threats. The State tries to conjure a tradition of -- of punishing negligent threats by analogy to other categorical exceptions. But, generally, they require at least recklessness. The closest analogue, incitement, requires specific intent. At bottom, any claim of a settled tradition of criminalizing negligent threats is impossible to square with Virginia versus Black, where this Court reversed convictions for cross-burning that would have easily satisfied a negligence standard, and a series of opinions emphasizing the central importance intent plays in making threats constitutionally proscribable. While the State predicts harm, it has shown no difference in criminal enforcement or the availability of civil protective orders in the many jurisdictions that already require subjective intent. There, prosecutors prove mens rea the same way prosecutors always have under countless criminal statutes, through objective evidence of the defendant's words and actions. Criminalizing misunderstanding is especially dangerous in an age when so much communication occurs on social media, which brings together strangers in an environment that removes much of the context that gives words meaning.

They state a claim that Proposition 12 violates the Commerce Clause almost per se because it's an extraterritorial regulation that conditions pork sales on out-of-state farmers adopting California's preferred farming methods, for no valid safety reason. Proposition 12 also fails the Pike test because it burdens interstate commerce for no local benefit. California wants to change farming methods everywhere to ""prevent animal cruelty by phasing out extreme methods of farm animal confinement."" That confinement occurs in other states. California imports 99.9 percent of its pork. Decisions like Baldwin establish that even when a law is triggered only by in-state sales, a state may not project its legislation into other states in that way. To do so infringes the territorial autonomy of sister states and it impedes our national common market. No other state makes its farmers house pigs the way that California does. And very few farmers do. They keep sows in individual pens during the vulnerable breeding period, and they provide less than 24 square feet of space in group pens.

Pigs go to a nursery, a finisher, then a slaughterhouse, where the packer butchers them into parts that are sold around the world in response to demand. The only safe course is to raise all pigs the California way, which is what we see buyers demanding, and the costs of doing that inhere in pork parts sold in places where buyers are unwilling to pay more to satisfy California's policy preferences.

Mr. Kneedler, you've said a couple of times that the Commerce Clause cannot allow for what it is that California is doing in this situation, and that sounds pretty categorical to me.

But -- but I also hear you making a claim that sounds to me like an extraterritoriality principle, and can I just focus your attention on that for a second? I think that the Petitioners have actually introduced two different kinds of extraterritoriality principle. In their briefs, they say that the rule should be that a state may not enact laws that have the practical effect of controlling conduct. And I worried about that when I read the brief because, to the extent we're talking about effect, then it introduces all kinds of questions, how much, how significant, and it doesn't sound like a bright-line rule anymore to me. But here today the Petitioners kind of move away a little bit from the controlling effect idea, and they say the per se rule should be essentially focused on the nature of the regulation, that the state law that conditions sales on out-of-state businesses operating in a certain way is the principle. And that's the one that you seem to be agreeing with. To the extent that you say that the problem is that a state who has a morality interest can't have a morality interest that is directed at the manner in which another state is conducting its business or other businesses are operating, why isn't that the same thing that the Petitioners are saying with respect to their extraterritoriality principle and, therefore, doesn't the government agree with them?","<speaker>Edwin S.

How do you respond to that?","<speaker>Patrick Strawbridge</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Racial classifications are wrong. That principle was enshrined in our law at great cost following the Civil War. A century of resistance to race neutrality followed, but this Court's landmark decision in Brown finally and firmly rejected the view that racial classifications have any role to play in providing educational opportunities. Since then, the Court has broadly enforced the Constitution's prohibition on the use of racial classifications. Whatever factors the government may use in deciding which jurors to sit, who you may marry, or which primary schools our children can attend, skin color is not one of them. Grutter is a glaring exception to this rule. This Court should overrule it. First, Grutter is grievously wrong. Its view that the educational benefits of diversity justify racial classifications contradicts the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal treatment. It relied upon stereotypical assumptions that race is necessarily a proxy for one's viewpoint, and its purported limits are empty and self-contradictory, which is why UNC simply ignores them.

37159,2022.21-707-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"They can -- they can get -- they can give pluses. And so what I'm worried about is that the rule that you're advocating, that in the context of a holistic review process, a university can take into account and value all of the other background and personal characteristics of other applicants, but they can't value race, what I'm worried about is that that seems to me to have the potential of causing more of an equal protection problem than it's actually solving. And the reason why I get to that possible conclusion is thinking about two applicants who would like to have their family backgrounds credited in this applications process, and I'm hoping to get your reaction to this hypothetical. The first applicant says: I'm from North Carolina. My family has been in this area for generations, since before the Civil War, and I would like you to know that I will be the fifth generation to graduate from the University of North Carolina. I now have that opportunity to do that, and given my family background, it's important to me that I get to attend this university. I want to honor my family's legacy by going to this school. The second applicant says, I'm from North Carolina, my family's been in this area for generations, since before the Civil War, but they were slaves and never had a chance to attend this venerable institution. As an African American, I now have that opportunity, and given my family -- family background, it's important to me to attend this university. I want to honor my family legacy by going to this school. Now, as I understand your no-race-conscious admissions rule, these two applicants would have a dramatically different opportunity to tell their family stories and to have them count. The first applicant would be able to have his family background considered and valued by the institution as part of its consideration of whether or not to admit him, while the second one wouldn't be able to because his story is in many ways bound up with his race and with the race of his ancestors. So I want to know, based on how your rule would likely play out in scenarios like that, why excluding consideration of race in a situation in which the person is not saying that his race is something that has impacted him in a negative way, he just wants to have it honored, just like the other person had their personal background family story honored, why is telling him no not an equal protection violation?","<speaker>Patrick Strawbridge</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Racial classifications are wrong.

37214,2022.21-707-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"All right. So final question, final question. Given a holistic review process like that, is there a risk of treating people differently by not allowing some applicants to talk about that aspect of their identity? I hear a process in which there's a form that says tell us about yourself, and people can put all sorts of things. I'm Catholic. I'm from, you know, Los Angeles. I'm a Latina, whatever. But now we're -- we're entertaining a rule in which some people can say the things they want about who they are and have that valued in the system, but other people are not going to be able to because they won't be able to reveal that they are Latino or African American or whatever. And I'm worried that that creates an inequity in the system with respect to being able to express your identity and, importantly, have it valued by the university when it is considering the goal of bringing in different people. Is that a -- is that -- is that a crazy worry, or is that something that -- that I should be thinking about and concerned about?","<speaker>Ryan Y. Park</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Diversity is our nation's greatest source of strength, but as our Reconstruction founders understood and our nation's history confirms, it also poses unique challenges to the American experiment. We live in a large and sometimes unwieldy democracy, and for that democracy to flourish, people of all different backgrounds and perspectives have to learn to live together and unite in common purpose. It was Brown's vision that education could be the engine of our democracy, a place where students could prepare for the rights and obligations of citizenship in a diverse and inclusive setting. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill seeks to fulfill Brown's vision by assembling a student body that is diverse along the many dimensions that matter in American life, including race, but also social class, geography, military status, intellectual views, and much more. This learning environment helps us seek truth, build bridges across students of different backgrounds, and, critically here, equip students with the tools needed to function effectively as citizens and leaders in our complex and increasingly diverse society. The university pursues these interests in scrupulous compliance with this Court's precedents, which have consistently held for decades that seeking the educational benefits of diversity is a compelling interest of the highest order and that universities may consider all aspects of a applicant's background to build a thriving campus community. The correctness of these precedents is confirmed by the historical record, which shows beyond doubt that our Reconstruction founders believed that race-conscious measures designed to promote an integrated learning environment were consistent with the original public meaning of the Equal Protection Clause.

A century of resistance to race neutrality followed, but this Court's landmark decision in Brown finally and firmly rejected the view that racial classifications have any role to play in providing educational opportunities. Since then, the Court has broadly enforced the Constitution's prohibition on the use of racial classifications. Whatever factors the government may use in deciding which jurors to sit, who you may marry, or which primary schools our children can attend, skin color is not one of them. Grutter is a glaring exception to this rule. This Court should overrule it. First, Grutter is grievously wrong. Its view that the educational benefits of diversity justify racial classifications contradicts the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal treatment. It relied upon stereotypical assumptions that race is necessarily a proxy for one's viewpoint, and its purported limits are empty and self-contradictory, which is why UNC simply ignores them. Grutter also creates many negative effects. Some applicants are incentivized to conceal their race. Others who were admitted on merit have their accomplishments diminished by assumptions that their race played a role in their admission. And there is no evidence that after two decades Grutter has somehow reduced the role of race on campus. Finally, no one is actually relying on Grutter. The opinion forecast its own demise and it made clear that race-based admissions must be diminishing over time. But that has not happened. UNC officials testified that they cannot imagine any scenario that would actually lead them to end their racial preferences.

37247,2022.21-707-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett,"One question. One -- one difference between your brief and your position and University of North Carolina's is that from the student's perspective -- and you were getting at this in some of your answers to Justice Sotomayor early on about Confederate statues and the presence of white supremacist groups -- is that from the student perspective, you know, students -- the educational benefit to the students might be in the form of counteracting feelings of isolation, sticking out, not being supported. In light of that, I'm wondering if you have anything to say about affinity groups and affinity housing? I think one thing at least insofar as I'm aware at the time Grutter was decided and certainly Bakke, that kind of a phenomenon where you have groups, say, where, you know, black students and allies can live or, you know, black student groups, same for, you know, Hispanic groups, et cetera, was not a phenomenon that was around then. And -- and I think one of the benefits is that it allows minority students to band together to reduce some of the feelings of isolation that you've been talking about.

The university pursues these interests in scrupulous compliance with this Court's precedents, which have consistently held for decades that seeking the educational benefits of diversity is a compelling interest of the highest order and that universities may consider all aspects of a applicant's background to build a thriving campus community.

Kavanaugh,"But, if you don't have a number, and I understand why it's difficult, and I understand the problems with that, I get all that, but if you don't have something measurable, it's going to be very hard for this Court, if we're called upon 10 years from now or 20 years from now, it's going to be -- you know, this is a bit of a replay of the Grutter argument, but if we come back to it, okay, are we there yet? What do we look at? You're saying meaningful opportunity. I don't know exactly what that means. I don't know how the schools will know when they have to -- when they've -- the -- the -- when the race-neutral alternative could get them close enough or if it has to meet some threshold. I don't know what ""meaningful"" means. I know what it means in terms of what you're describing. I don't know how it translates to looking at the composition of a student body achieved through race-neutral alternatives and says, yes, that gives them meaningful opportunity. And I don't know how educators are going to make that decision, so any help you can provide on that I would appreciate.","<speaker>Ryan Y.

We live in a large and sometimes unwieldy democracy, and for that democracy to flourish, people of all different backgrounds and perspectives have to learn to live together and unite in common purpose. It was Brown's vision that education could be the engine of our democracy, a place where students could prepare for the rights and obligations of citizenship in a diverse and inclusive setting. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill seeks to fulfill Brown's vision by assembling a student body that is diverse along the many dimensions that matter in American life, including race, but also social class, geography, military status, intellectual views, and much more. This learning environment helps us seek truth, build bridges across students of different backgrounds, and, critically here, equip students with the tools needed to function effectively as citizens and leaders in our complex and increasingly diverse society. The university pursues these interests in scrupulous compliance with this Court's precedents, which have consistently held for decades that seeking the educational benefits of diversity is a compelling interest of the highest order and that universities may consider all aspects of a applicant's background to build a thriving campus community. The correctness of these precedents is confirmed by the historical record, which shows beyond doubt that our Reconstruction founders believed that race-conscious measures designed to promote an integrated learning environment were consistent with the original public meaning of the Equal Protection Clause. To be clear, UNC would like nothing more than to achieve its educational aims through race-neutral means. It has taken extensive efforts to do so and has seen steady and continuing progress toward this goal. But this progress has been halting, and the university retains a powerful interest in preventing the backsliding that would occur if this Court took away the power to decide this important social policy issue from the people of North Carolina.

37277,2022.21-707-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett,"General, I have a question about the originalists' evidence. And, you know, there's nuance in that, and I don't want to get into the details of that, but my question is how it would affect your position in this case. So I entirely agree with you and it's established in our precedent that it's not always illegal to take race-conscious measures. Remedial measures, you know, are -- are an example of that. Do you agree, though, on your understanding of the originalist evidence that strict scrutiny -- and, obviously, we didn't think about scrutiny in those days, but, you know, it's not accurate to say, I agree with you, when you look at the originalist evidence that it was always color-blind, that some race-conscious measures were permitted at least in a remedial sense, right? Desegregation is an example of that. So the question is, under what circumstances have those remedial measures been permitted? And, you know, that's a Section 5 question. How would that originalist evidence affect your case? If you were writing on a blank slate, would you say that university affirmative action programs don't implicate the Fourteenth Amendment? Or are you saying that they just very plainly would satisfy our modern tiers of scrutiny because the interest is compelling even if we didn't have Bakke, Grutter, Fisher, et cetera?","<speaker>Ryan Y.

37278,2022.21-707-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"Yes. I just wanted two quick things. One is about the originalist position. Isn't it at least ambiguous as to what the history is telling us about -- about whether or not race-consciousness can be used? I know your position and the position of some folks is that it's clear that the history is saying race-consciousness is okay. And as Justice Barrett mentioned, there is evidence of that. And if there's evidence on the other side, don't we need to have a clear picture of this in order to overcome stare decisis? I mean, we have the historians' brief that says even if the history was unclear, and it's not, overcoming stare -- stare decisis requires something more than ambiguous historical evidence. Do you agree with that?","<speaker>Ryan Y.

37279,2022.21-707-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"And, finally, is there some connection between how race is being used and the concerns that some of my colleagues have about the amount of time? So what I'm trying to get at or think about is whether Bakke, for example -- Bakke was a set-aside program as far as I understood, that there was actually 16 seats in a class of a hundred that were being set aside for underrepresented minorities, and, therefore, obviously, the concerns about perniciousness and being problematic and we want it to end, we don't want this going on forever. But, when you have a situation like this in which you're talking about a holistic review, other people are getting pluses in the system, no one's automatically getting a plus in the system, I wonder if the urge to end it -- and what is the end it? The end it is to include race alongside 40 other characteristics. I wonder if it implicates the same kinds of concerns about the use of race?","<speaker>Ryan Y.
