Clement</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Long before the framing, it was clear that eminent domain was an essential element of sovereignty and that private parties could be deputized to exercise that power for infrastructure projects. Once the federal eminent-domain power was exercised, this Court made clear that state lands are not immune, but states are entitled to just compensation like other property owners. New Jersey does not take issue with those precedents but still asserts immunity from the process used to ensure just compensation if not initiated by the federal government itself. That claim fails for two interrelated reasons. First, states acceded to the federal government's superior eminent-domain authority in the Plan of the Convention. In our system of dual sovereignty, only one sovereign can have the ultimate authority over land when the federal and state governments assert conflicting claims. The Supremacy Clause largely settles that debate, and New Jersey concedes that its sovereignty must yield when the federal government decides to take state property. But, once it concedes that, it has no immunity left to assert in the proceedings necessary to effectuate the taking. That follows from the immovable property exception, which long predates the framing. No sovereign has ever had immunity from the eminent domain authority of the superior sovereign over immovable property. It also follows from the very nature of eminent domain. Eminent domain that depends on consent is an oxymoron. Second, the proceedings here are in rem and can only augment the state treasury. This Court has recognized that in rem proceedings pose a lesser threat to state sovereignty. Justices Washington and Story made the same point when the Eleventh Amendment was new. And of all in rem actions, eminent-domain proceedings pose the least concerns. They allege no wrongdoing, they impose no liability, and they cannot be brought without federal authorization.

New Jersey does not take issue with those precedents but still asserts immunity from the process used to ensure just compensation if not initiated by the federal government itself. That claim fails for two interrelated reasons. First, states acceded to the federal government's superior eminent-domain authority in the Plan of the Convention. In our system of dual sovereignty, only one sovereign can have the ultimate authority over land when the federal and state governments assert conflicting claims. The Supremacy Clause largely settles that debate, and New Jersey concedes that its sovereignty must yield when the federal government decides to take state property. But, once it concedes that, it has no immunity left to assert in the proceedings necessary to effectuate the taking. That follows from the immovable property exception, which long predates the framing. No sovereign has ever had immunity from the eminent domain authority of the superior sovereign over immovable property. It also follows from the very nature of eminent domain.

Under ACCA, the government has the burden of showing that the increased sentence is warranted, so it has to carry the burden of looking to the least elements approach. But it's different when you're seeking the benefit of removal under the immigration case. There, the person who's seeking -- has the burden of -- that benefit is your client, and, therefore, you have the burden of showing the most elements approach for the prior conviction. Why isn't it simply the different burdens under ACCA and the immigration statute that account for the fact that in one case -- the different burden of going forward? Whether you're seeking a greater sentence or seeking the benefit of removal, why doesn't that simply account for the allocation of the burden of proof?

He can for two reasons. First, for decades, the statutory term ""convicted"" has been understood to require a categorical approach under which a past offense won't lead to mandatory removal or an enhanced sentence unless the record of conviction establishes every element of a federal predicate offense to a legal certainty. So we always presume that a conviction stands for nothing more than the least that the record of conviction establishes. And that rule works the same under the categorical and modified categorical approaches because courts can look to the least of the alternative elements under a divisible statute, as this Court has. Second, Congress didn't disturb that rule when it enacted a general burden-of-proof provision that says nothing about convictions. And that's not surprising because all we're talking about is a gatekeeping step. There's still the discretionary step, where the Attorney General is unbound by the categorical approach and can make an individualized determination about who gets relief. So, ultimately, it doesn't matter whether you think of the modified categorical approach as raising a question of law or a question of fact, because it's common for presumptions to operate on questions of fact too.

The problem is when the student says something that implicates those subjects but links it in some way to a student or a teacher. And what you say is -- and the Solicitor General makes a similar argument -- it matters whether the speech targets the school. I have no idea what it means to target the school. Now let me give you an example to make this more concrete, and since Tinker occurred back during the Vietnam War, it -- it -- it will relate to that. So, during the war, a student says, war is immoral, American soldiers are baby killers, I hope there are a lot of casualties so that people will rise up.

18597,2020.20-255-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Ms. Blatt. I want to focus on the facts of this case a bit and -- and my reaction to it. As you say and I think helpful for you, the context here is a team and a coach, not the school more generally. But, as a judge and maybe as a coach and a parent too, it seems like maybe a bit of over -- overreaction by the coach. So my reaction when I read this, she's competitive, she cares, she blew off steam like millions of other kids have when they're disappointed about being cut from the high school team or not being in the starting lineup or not making all league. And just by way of comparison about -- and to show how much it means to people, you know, arguably, the greatest basketball player of all time is inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2009 and gives a speech, and what does he talk about? He talks about getting cut as a sophomore from the varsity team. And he wasn't joking. He was critical 30 years later. It still -- it still bothered him. And I think that's just emblematic of how much it means to kids to make a high school team. It is so important to their lives, and coaches sweat the cuts, and it guts coaches to have to cut a kid who's on the bubble, and -- and good coaches understand the importance and they understand the emotions. So maybe what bothers me when I read all this is that it didn't seem like the punishment was tailored to the offense given what I just said about how important it is and you know how much it means to the kids. I mean, a year's suspension from the team just seems excessive to me. But how does that fit into the First Amendment doctrine or does it fit in at all in a case like this?","<speaker>Lisa S.

But your three-part test certainly has its own issues. You know, it's not going to be easy to apply, and I think a lot of the questions that you've gotten today show a concern, including in this case, that schools abuse this authority and that they punish things that maybe don't cause substantial disruption or political speech or religious speech that they shouldn't or -- you know, I think you've heard a lot of skepticism about whether the speech at issue in this case actually caused substantial disruption. So I -- I -- I -- I guess my concern is, if we have two -- two tests being offered or on offer, neither one is going to be easy to apply in all cases, they'll both have hard cases, which one ought we apply? Which one is the more protective of speech?

So you started your argument by saying that this case was an opportunity for us to respore -- restore the promise of Halliburton II by making the Basic presumption rebuttable.

What does it really accomplish?","<speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this case, the court of appeals upheld the certification of a securities class action based on exceptionally generic and aspirational statements in the face of overwhelming and unrebutted evidence that the statements had no impact on the stock price. In so doing, the court of appeals committed two legal errors. First, the court refused to consider the generality of the statements as evidence tending to disprove price impact. As Respondents now agree, a court may consider the nature of a statement in making that determination. There is no merit to the further contention that a court may consider the nature of the statement only through expert testimony. Second, the court of appeals erred by holding that the Basic presumption shifted the ultimate burden of persuasion to a defendant on the issue of price impact. Rule 301 governs presumption, and it shifts only the burden of production, unless a statute or rule provides otherwise. Basic plainly created a presumption, and Congress has not even recognized a private cause of action for securities fraud, much less provided that the Basic presumption shifts the burden of persuasion. Should the Court agree with us on either question presented, it should reverse the judgment below. The lower courts desperately need guidance on how to navigate this Court's decisions on the Basic presumption. While Halliburton II held out the promise that defendants would be able to rebut the presumption, that has proven to be effectively impossible thanks, in part, to the inflation maintenance theory. And under the correct legal standard, this is an easy case because the statements were exceedingly generic, the alleged conflicts of interest were already in the public domain, and Respondents presented no valid evidence to establish the cause of the stock drops. If certification is permitted here, the promise of Halliburton II will have been betrayed, and any stock drop will inevitably result in a reverse-engineered securities class action based on statements like these. The court of appeals' judgment should be reversed. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2020,coherent

19278,2020.20-222-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch,"Good morning, Mr. Goldstein. You know, as I understand it, you know, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that this is a class that needs to be certified. Then comes in a presumption as part of that that a misstatement of fact affects price because of the efficient market theory. Fine. Then the defendant comes forward with direct evidence saying, well, in this case, this misstatement did not affect price. And the question then is, what -- what happens next? And it seems to me one of two things could happen. One, the plaintiff can come forward with evidence, as you did here, trying to rebut that direct evidence and say, uh-uh, you're wrong, that -- that -- that, here, it did, in fact, affect price. And -- and -- and you may carry your burden of proof and win the day. The other alternative, though, is, if we flip the burden and put it on the defendant here, the plaintiff might be able to do nothing and just rest on the presumption that there's a price impact in the face of direct evidence that there wasn't, and then the district judge is, where Justice Alito worried about, is weighing direct evidence of no price impact versus a theory, a presumption. And I'm not sure I understand how a district judge can do that. And isn't that some evidence that we should require, consistent with Rule 301, that the defendant carry its burden, as you say -- as you say you did here, of showing that the direct evidence isn't to be credited and that the presumption should win out as a result?","<speaker>Kannon K.

19287,2020.20-222-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett,"Good morning, Mr. Goldstein. So I think, you know, there's been a lot of discussion today about how much daylight there is between you and the Petitioners on QP 1. And you say that it's the Petitioners' fault that they forfeited this argument, that it's different than what they did in the Second Circuit. But it seems to me that you've both moved towards the middle. I mean, they've backed off on how important they think generality is and whether it can be decided categorically. But you've also conceded that generality is relevant, and you've given on the common sense, on the role of the court's common sense. So now we are left, you know, in this position where you've both moved more closely together, and now we have to decide what to do about the Second Circuit's opinion. Don't you think, Mr. Goldstein, that it might be helpful, given the positions that you've both taken, to make clear that language like this in the Second Circuit's opinion where it says ""whether alleged misstatements are too general to demonstrate price impact has nothing to do with the issue of whether common questions predominate over individual ones,"" so whether that's -- you know, you called it -- you know, maybe their literary effort needed to be polished a bit, I mean, no matter what the cause, don't you think it would be worth our while in clarifying what the standard is that you now both appear to agree on?","<speaker>Kannon K.

That broad text unambiguously precludes Respondent's Bivens action here, which asserts the same injuries based on the very same subject matter. The Sixth Circuit's refusal to apply the judgment bar in this case rested on two propositions: first, that when the United States prevails in an FTCA action, the district court must necessarily dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and, second, that such a jurisdictional dismissal does not trigger the judgment bar. Both propositions are wrong. This Court rejected the Sixth Circuit's jurisdictional analysis in FDIC v. Meyer, but even more important for present purposes, this Court in Simmons v. Himmelreich squarely rejected the Sixth Circuit's conclusion that the judgment bar never applies to an FTCA judgment for the government. The Court held instead that the judgment bar does apply where a plaintiff simply fails to prove his claim.

Respondent now concedes that the Sixth Circuit's reasoning cannot be reconciled with Simmons, so he shifts to an alternative argument. He says he should be able to bring an FTCA action and an individual action together without the judgment bar coming into play. But the statutory text directly refutes that argument too.

Jaicomo</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. Through the text of the FTCA, Congress provides two independent and easily administrable rules that control the application of the judgment bar. First, the judgment bar does not apply to claims brought together in a single action. As Will and Simmons explained, the text of Section 2676 imports common law res judicata. In the history of American law, res judicata has never been applied to claims brought together in a single action. Section 2676's requirement of the judgment in an action, not a judgment on a claim, demonstrates that Congress did not intend a judgment bar to depart from that common law history. Second, the judgment bar does not apply to claims dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Because Section 1346 restricts FTCA jurisdiction to actions on claims that satisfy six elements, the dismissal of an FTCA claim under Rule 12(b)(6) does not trigger the judgment bar. As Meyer explained, a claim does not come within the FTCA's jurisdiction unless a plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to state a cause of action under the statute. Thus, a court's holding that a plaintiff has failed to state a claim under the FTCA is not the judgment in an action under Section 1346; it is a holding that the court lacks jurisdiction to enter such a judgment. Both the same claims rule and the jurisdictional rule honor the language Congress enacted in the FTCA. Both present simple, predictable standards that courts and parties can follow, and neither results in duplicative litigation. Under either rule, the judgment bar does not apply to this case. This Court should affirm the decision below and allow King to pursue his meritorious constitutional claims in this action, which is the one and only lawsuit King has ever filed.

First, the Ninth Circuit treated the drafts as final, rather than predecisional, because it viewed them as the Services' last word on the version of the EPA rule under consideration in December 2013.

Second, the Ninth Circuit viewed these drafts as final documents because the drafts largely don't contain red-lining, marginal comments, or other obvious signs of still being in flux. That reasoning is unsound. No one would confuse a law clerk's draft with a final decision by a judge, even if the draft is pristine.

They were written by staff at the Services as a recommendation to agency decisionmakers about the position the Services should adopt in the ongoing consultation with the EPA. When the relevant decisionmakers were presented with these drafts, they did not adopt them, they did not sign them, and they did not even transmit them in full to the EPA. Instead, they decided that more work needed to be done before making a final decision. The Ninth Circuit committed two principal errors in concluding, nonetheless, that these drafts are outside the scope of the deliberative process privilege. First, the Ninth Circuit treated the drafts as final, rather than predecisional, because it viewed them as the Services' last word on the version of the EPA rule under consideration in December 2013. But the EPA modified its approach, and the Services never had any occasion to make a final decision about the abandoned version of the EPA rule. In the D.C.

Second, the Ninth Circuit viewed these drafts as final documents because the drafts largely don't contain red-lining, marginal comments, or other obvious signs of still being in flux.

First, the agency officials who are engaged in deliberations need to be able to speak with candor, as Justice Gorsuch was just saying. Second, FOIA officers, who are rampant throughout the executive branch, spend an enormous amount of time and resources on FOIA, could use clarity. And then district court judges in the District of Columbia and elsewhere, if you talk to, would lament the lack of clarity and clear rules in -- in FOIA cases. So that raises the concern that the effects-based test or looking at the effects of the memo could become so fact-intensive and could really blur the longstanding predecisional principle of the deliberative process privilege because lots of drafts have -- have real effects within the executive branch.

Your argument, as I understand it, is, under 1231, that there is a final order of removal dating back to the original order of removal. But, for purposes of 1252, the question becomes, is there some chance for judicial review of -- of the withholding-only proceedings? And -- and -- and that -- that statute also grants review only of the final order of removal. Judge Richardson acknowledged this difficulty in his dissent in the Fourth Circuit and said that means that there's effectively going to be no judicial review of withholding-only proceedings. But the government apparently in the Fourth Circuit thought that there could be.

So why isn't the default that, if it's through the fault of the government or no fault of the noncitizen that removal doesn't take place within the removal period, why isn't the default supervision, rather than, as you suggested to Justice Sotomayor, continued confinement?","<speaker>Vivek Suri</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondents are detained under Section 1231, not under Section 1226. In the first place, the text of Section 1231 refers repeatedly to an order of removal or to the aliens who have been ordered removed. That is clear from the caption, from the operative provision, and from the definition of the removal period. There is no dispute here that these aliens have been ordered removed. Indeed, that is the definition of reinstating a removal order. In the second place, Section 1226 supports that conclusion. The best way to see that is to lay Section 1226 alongside the reinstatement clause. Section 1226 says that it applies pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed, and the reinstatement clause says that these aliens shall be removed. Putting those two provisions together, it's clear that in the eyes of the law, the decision that has to be made -- that has to be pending for Section 1226 to apply has been made in this case. And if the Court finds all of that unconvincing, it should turn to the structure of the statute. Congress put the provisions governing reinstatement, withholding, and the selection of the country of removal all in Section 1231, not in Section 1226. That's a structural indication that it's Section 1231 that applies. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2020,incoherent

Courts, obviously, review agency legal interpretations to make sure the agency is not departing from the law enacted by Congress, and on that front, reviewing the law, our review is -- is usually pretty tight, pretty stringent, putting aside whether there's an ambiguity in the law. On the other hand and critically, federal courts do not make the policy calls. We defer to agency policy judgments within the constraints imposed by Congress. And, here, it's the broadest possible language that Congress uses, public interest, not much of a constraint at all, a broad and Ms. Walker alluded to arguably too broad a delegation. But that doesn't give us much to work with. And then arbitrary and capricious review -- and Judge Sirica said this many times -- is highly deferential to the agency's policy judgments. And -- and there's a lot of case law, as you know, in the FCC context, Justice White's opinion for the Court in the WNCN case, that predictive judgments made by the agency get especially significant judicial deference.

Harris</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Social Security claimants do not need to challenge the constitutionality of their ALJ's appointment in ALJ proceedings to obtain judicial review of that issue. First, under Sims versus Apfel, when an agency holds non-adversarial proceedings and does not depend on parties to identify the issues, courts should not imply an issue exhaustion requirement on their own. Sims declined to imply an issue exhaustion requirement for Appeals Council proceedings and invited the SSA to promulgate such a rule, but the agency never did. Twenty years later, Appeals Council and ALJ proceedings are still non-adversarial and informal. Both conduct a plenary review and must develop arguments for and against benefits. Indeed, the Appeals Council must spot even errors the claimants didn't raise to ALJs. Courts should not penalize claimants when the agency itself does not care what claimants raise to ALJs and has never notified them of an issue exhaustion requirement. Second, the government relitigates Sims, which rejected the government's universal default rule of issue exhaustion. Sims also rejected the government's concern that courts would be stymied by applying the Social Security regulations to technical, fact-based questions the agency hasn't considered. Under Sims, courts routinely entertain fact-heavy issues that the agency never passed upon because the error first appeared in the ALJ's decision and the claimant didn't raise it to the Appeals Council. Third, at the very least, this Court should not require claimants to exhaust Appointments Clause challenges. Constitutional questions are beyond the agency's competence, and raising the Appointments Clause was futile. The government knew about the Appointments Clause problem, didn't fix it, and barred ALJs from considering it. I welcome questions.</text>",2020,coherent

So one of the best -- I mean, Sims is obviously your best argument and its discussion of the distinction between adversarial and non-adversarial proceedings. I'm wondering how unique the Social Security Administration is. I mean, so you point out that it's non-adversarial, it's informal. You know, Sims made those points too. If we were to rule your way, would we be, you know, saying that there are other agencies in which this exhaustion of issues requirement did not apply?","<speaker>Sarah M. Harris</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Social Security claimants do not need to challenge the constitutionality of their ALJ's appointment in ALJ proceedings to obtain judicial review of that issue. First, under Sims versus Apfel, when an agency holds non-adversarial proceedings and does not depend on parties to identify the issues, courts should not imply an issue exhaustion requirement on their own. Sims declined to imply an issue exhaustion requirement for Appeals Council proceedings and invited the SSA to promulgate such a rule, but the agency never did. Twenty years later, Appeals Council and ALJ proceedings are still non-adversarial and informal. Both conduct a plenary review and must develop arguments for and against benefits. Indeed, the Appeals Council must spot even errors the claimants didn't raise to ALJs. Courts should not penalize claimants when the agency itself does not care what claimants raise to ALJs and has never notified them of an issue exhaustion requirement. Second, the government relitigates Sims, which rejected the government's universal default rule of issue exhaustion. Sims also rejected the government's concern that courts would be stymied by applying the Social Security regulations to technical, fact-based questions the agency hasn't considered. Under Sims, courts routinely entertain fact-heavy issues that the agency never passed upon because the error first appeared in the ALJ's decision and the claimant didn't raise it to the Appeals Council. Third, at the very least, this Court should not require claimants to exhaust Appointments Clause challenges. Constitutional questions are beyond the agency's competence, and raising the Appointments Clause was futile.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To resolve this case, the Court need only apply either of two well-established rules.

The courts of appeals have consistently applied that rule in the specific context of Social Security ALJ proceedings for decades. Petitioners suggest that the government is asking the Court to change the rules of the game, but the reality is the exact opposite. The second rule is that a party forfeits an Appointments Clause challenge by failing to raise it before the agency itself. Under the traditional de facto officer doctrine, a private party could contest the legitimacy of an official's appointment only in a direct suit against the official himself. That doctrine prevented the enormously destabilizing consequences that could otherwise result. Although the Court has since loosened the doctrine, it has critically limited disruption by requiring a timely challenge before the agency. Enforcement of that rule is particularly appropriate here, where Petitioners do not identify any prejudice resulting from the allegedly invalid appointment. Petitioners' primary response is to point to this Court's decision in Sims, but Justice O'Connor's controlling opinion rested on her conclusion that the agency effectively misled claimants about the need to raise issues. This case is different. The regulations governing ALJ proceedings do not lull claimants into thinking they may forego raising issues.

The first is the 100-year-old rule that a party challenging agency action forfeit issues not raised during agency proceedings. The courts of appeals have consistently applied that rule in the specific context of Social Security ALJ proceedings for decades. Petitioners suggest that the government is asking the Court to change the rules of the game, but the reality is the exact opposite. The second rule is that a party forfeits an Appointments Clause challenge by failing to raise it before the agency itself. Under the traditional de facto officer doctrine, a private party could contest the legitimacy of an official's appointment only in a direct suit against the official himself. That doctrine prevented the enormously destabilizing consequences that could otherwise result. Although the Court has since loosened the doctrine, it has critically limited disruption by requiring a timely challenge before the agency. Enforcement of that rule is particularly appropriate here, where Petitioners do not identify any prejudice resulting from the allegedly invalid appointment. Petitioners' primary response is to point to this Court's decision in Sims, but Justice O'Connor's controlling opinion rested on her conclusion that the agency effectively misled claimants about the need to raise issues. This case is different. The regulations governing ALJ proceedings do not lull claimants into thinking they may forego raising issues. And the consequences of excusing forfeiture here would be far more dramatic. Whereas Sims involved a requirement to raise an issue before a particular adjudicator, Petitioners contend that claimants may decline to raise an issue before the agency at all. The Court should reject Petitioners' request to work intervals of change in the law and affirm the judgments below.</text>",2020,coherent

Chike and Joseph lost forever the chance to get those days back and speak their message to their peers. No policy change can ever restore that lost opportunity. And as this Court said in Carey, Stachura, and Farrar, the appropriate remedy to redress those past harms is nominal damages. Nominal damages awards satisfy Article III. Farrar explains that nominal damages provide relief on the merits, vindicate the plaintiff through an enforceable judgment, and modify the defendant's behavior for the plaintiff's benefit by forcing the defendant to pay the plaintiff money, the classic Article III remedy for past injury. A one, 10, or 100 dollar award satisfies Article III because it puts money in a plaintiff's pocket, no matter how it is labeled: compensatory, statutory, liquidated, or nominal. The Eleventh Circuit's outlier rule is a radical departure. For centuries, English and American courts have awarded nominal damages when no future threat exists, even after a plaintiff waives compensatory damages. Every circuit to address the issue does the same, even the Eleventh, until this recent decision. This Court should retain the long-standing rule. It has not resulted in a glut of cases, and the alternative makes a mess of this Court's clear Article III jurisprudence. Nominal damages provide a remedy in many contexts, redressing injuries that transcend price tags, from unconstitutional searches and seizures to free exercise and due process violations, to censorship and compulsion of speech. These constitutional rights are invaluable, even when they don't result in quantifiable harm. Yet, the officials urge you to treat them as worthless.

In other words, they're ways to try to determine legal rights going forward before the declaratory judgment form existed. The second group of cases are cases in which there's injury that's hard to monetize, and -- and these cases are asking for something to recompense that injury. But the reason why those cases aren't very relevant anymore is that, in our world, we monetize those claims all the time. We now live in a world, unlike the historical world, in which we acknowledge claims for emotional distress, claims for dignitary harms of all kinds, which makes the nominal damages claim unnecessary. The third group of cases is a case in which what the plaintiff really wants is vindication. It's a statement that I'm right, the defendant is wrong.

So they'd lose out, people like Ms. Swift and groups like that.

Emotional harm and distress is a particular example. Areas where it's difficult to quantify damages and expensive to do so require a large enough damage to justify the effort.

A one, 10, or 100 dollar award satisfies Article III because it puts money in a plaintiff's pocket, no matter how it is labeled: compensatory, statutory, liquidated, or nominal. The Eleventh Circuit's outlier rule is a radical departure. For centuries, English and American courts have awarded nominal damages when no future threat exists, even after a plaintiff waives compensatory damages. Every circuit to address the issue does the same, even the Eleventh, until this recent decision. This Court should retain the long-standing rule. It has not resulted in a glut of cases, and the alternative makes a mess of this Court's clear Article III jurisprudence. Nominal damages provide a remedy in many contexts, redressing injuries that transcend price tags, from unconstitutional searches and seizures to free exercise and due process violations, to censorship and compulsion of speech. These constitutional rights are invaluable, even when they don't result in quantifiable harm. Yet, the officials urge you to treat them as worthless.

And then, on the attorney's fees question that's been raised, those -- if those were fully available, then that would provide, obviously, an incentive for some plaintiffs to continue litigating even if there was no other injunctive or compensatory relief at stake. But my understanding of the case law, Farrar, and it seems to be how it's applied in most lower courts, is that plaintiffs do not receive much in the way of attorney's fees when they only receive nominal damages, and, therefore, the incentive to litigate wastefully is not as present.

But it seems to me that, in your responses to Justice Alito's questions, Justice Kagan's questions, Justice Gorsuch's questions, you've kind of gone back and forth on the triviality of the money point. So, you know, you suggested to Justice Alito that at some point it's so little money that really should be taken into account. But, of course, our precedents say that, you know, even -- even a small amount is enough. And so, in the Taylor Swift example or in Justice Gorsuch's bus fare example, I -- I heard you -- at least I took you to concede that even a very trivial amount would constitute a compensatory injury under Article III.

I'm not sure this wolf comes as a wolf, Mr. Stewart, but I still think it may be a wolf, as Justice Scalia famously said, and he said, in those cases, it can be discerned by careful and perceptive analysis. So here's why -- here -- here's the sources of my concern on that front. First, this structure is a real break from tradition, which we've said in cases like Free Enterprise Fund and many others, perhaps the most telling indication of a constitutional problem is the departure -- the lack of historical precedent. The lack of agency review of the ALJ decision by someone who's appointed by the President with advice and consent of the Senate is absent here and is ordinarily present and historically has been present. And then, second, the lack of accountability, as the Chief Justice said and Justice Gorsuch was just saying, these are multimillion, sometimes billion-dollar decisions being made not by someone who's accountable in the usual way that the Appointments Clause demands. And the director, on rehearing, does not have the unilateral power to reverse. So, you know, if Congress is going to do that, they can eliminate agency review and prevent removal at will, then it's easy to make these AL -- APJs presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed.

So, you know, the federal -- well, think about -- one unusual thing about the remedy here is that it's not one specific provision in this statutory scheme that's being challenged as unconstitutional. It's the way that they work together. You know, so we could, if we decided that it was unconstitutional, perhaps make all of the APJs subject to -- say they're principal officers, and so they have to be subject to presidential appointment, senatorial confirmation. We could say, listen, we're going to strike the provision in the statute that says only the PTAB may grant rehearings so that the director has that authority. We could make them maybe at-will employees, so they're removable at the discretion of the director without having to go through the full process that we discussed before. That's a lot of discretion to give us in trying to shape a remedial -- a remedy here. Why should we even assert the authority to do that, to sever?","<speaker>Mark A. Perry</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Arthrex's proposal for a bright-line administrative review requirement rests on a single line from Edmond noting that the military judges couldn't render a final decision unless permitted to do so by other executive officers. The Court in that sentence was not announcing a requirement for inferior officer status. It was commenting on the narrow scope of CAAF review, which followed its observation that the JAG could not provide advance guidance to the military judges. In sharp contrast, the PTO director can and does give substantive guidance to APJs. He also has unilateral institution and assignment power, and he can order review of any board decision. Moreover, only the director takes final actions by confirming or canceling patent claims. APJs can't render any decision unless the director permits them to do so. They are inferior officers.</text>",2020,Coherent.

Why isn't -- under our precedents and basic principles, why isn't it okay that the executive allow the adjudicators a significant degree of leeway because they're just that? They're adjudicators, they're coming up with particular factual determinations, and you don't want the politically accountable people to have the authority to overturn those in -- in situations where billions of dollars are at stake, but, at the same time, in terms of basic patent rules and approaches and guidance, you do want them to have that responsibility. Why -- why isn't that a fair balance?","<speaker>Malcolm L. Stewart</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Edmond versus United States, this Court held that Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals judges were inferior officers. The Court based that conclusion on the combined supervisory powers of the Coast Guard Judge Advocate General and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. Here, the mechanisms by which the PTO's director can supervise administrative patent judges substantially exceed the combined powers of the supervising officials in Edmond. The Judge Advocate General was authorized to promulgate rules of procedure for the Court of Criminal Appeals, and he could remove individuals from their judicial assignments without cause. The PTO director can exercise those same two powers, but he has other important tools of control as well. The director can promulgate binding guidance concerning substantive patent law. He can designate particular board opinions as precedential, thus making those opinions binding on future panels. He can also decide whether any particular review will be instituted and which judges will sit on the panel. And he can de-institute a review even after it has been commenced. Arthrex focuses primarily on the purported absence of any mechanism by which the director can review a panel's final written decision. But the board can grant rehearing of any such decision, and the director is a member of the board and is authorized to decide which members will sit on any panel. The director, thus, can convene a new panel that consists of himself and two other members of his choosing to decide whether any final written decision will be reheard. The director's power over rehearings is not plenary since he must exercise it jointly with two other board members. But, in Edmond, the review authority of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces was not plenary either since that court could not reassess the factual findings of the court of appeals -- from the Court of Criminal Appeals.

The Judge Advocate General was authorized to promulgate rules of procedure for the Court of Criminal Appeals, and he could remove individuals from their judicial assignments without cause. The PTO director can exercise those same two powers, but he has other important tools of control as well. The director can promulgate binding guidance concerning substantive patent law. He can designate particular board opinions as precedential, thus making those opinions binding on future panels. He can also decide whether any particular review will be instituted and which judges will sit on the panel. And he can de-institute a review even after it has been commenced. Arthrex focuses primarily on the purported absence of any mechanism by which the director can review a panel's final written decision. But the board can grant rehearing of any such decision, and the director is a member of the board and is authorized to decide which members will sit on any panel. The director, thus, can convene a new panel that consists of himself and two other members of his choosing to decide whether any final written decision will be reheard. The director's power over rehearings is not plenary since he must exercise it jointly with two other board members. But, in Edmond, the review authority of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces was not plenary either since that court could not reassess the factual findings of the court of appeals -- from the Court of Criminal Appeals. Taken together, the director's supervisory powers are fully sufficient to render administrative patent judges inferior officers.</text>",2020,coherent

22524,2020.20-297-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Clement. To pick up on Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kagan's questions, let me make sure I understand the risk of harm. As I read your brief, you said the risk of harm is likely -- risk of harm alone is likely not enough for damages as opposed to injunctive relief. At least that's how I read Footnote 4 of your brief. In response to Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch, I think you were saying -- but tell me if I'm wrong -- that the risk of harm is still not enough for damages unless the risk of harm is itself a separate harm. In other words, the risk of harm is not cancer, in other words, you don't have the cancer, but the risk of harm may create emotional injury.

22527,2020.20-297-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett,"Mr. Clement, I want to ask you a follow-on to Justice Kagan's hypothetical about the people who drink water are exposed to a carcinogen, they're at 50 percent risk of cancer. She asked you to distinguish between what would happen if they filed within the five-year period in which they would know whether the risk had materialized or outside the five-year period, say in the sixth year. I want to know what would happen, say, if they filed in year two, but the litigation drags on and on and on and the case doesn't come to its conclusion until year six. So, if I understand your response to Justice Kagan, it would essentially mean that people had standing at the outset of the suit. But, if they were in the 50 percent that were home-free, they would lose their standing by the end? I mean, that just seems like an odd way to think about it since we normally judge standing at the outset, and when something dissipates over the course of a suit, we think about it in terms of mootness, not that the injury isn't concrete.

So, as I read Spokeo, you know, and it cites Clapper after that language, it preserves, you know, the possibility of standing in a prospective suit where harm is imminent but hasn't yet happened. And then, for slander per se, you know, there are some harms that were recognized at the common law, as we have discussed during this argument, that were presumed to cause harm because, even if you didn't have to prove that you lost a job over it, you know, that the risk was so great that in and of itself the common law tort proposed it. And it seems like this case is about whether, even going beyond that, a big risk that the tort would actually happen to you is itself a tort. And I -- I haven't heard you disclaim that as a proper reading of Spokeo.

22571,2020.20-297-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Issacharoff. I think you have a good argument with respect to the 1,853 in terms of the reasonable procedures, but I'm more concerned about the 6,332, whose information was not, in essence, published. Under -- in Spokeo, of course, the information was published, which is a big distinction, as I see it, between that case and this, as to the 6,332. And when Spokeo talked then about risk of harm, it was talking about harm beyond the publication, at least as I understood it, for example, publication of ZIP codes, which strikes me as a very different thing than risk -- talking about risk of harm when there hasn't been publication to begin with. So that -- that's point one. And then, on -- on risk of harm, you heard me talk about damages versus injunctive relief. It strikes me that risk of harm, of course, is enough to get you injunctive relief. With damages, I -- I hadn't thought risk of harm would get you damages -- standing for damages claims unless the risk of harm was itself a harm. Judge Tatel in the D.C. Circuit analogized it: If inaccurate information falls into a database, does it make a sound? And his answer to that, applying Stoke -- Spokeo, was no. And I guess then-Judge Barrett, talking about no harm/no foul, seemed to be picking up on the same thing.

And then, in the real world -- I want to pick up on some of Justice Kagan's questions -- kind of real-world, how people draft these contracts, what they expect, my understanding was that the question of who decides arbitrability, the who decides question, is almost never divided between a court and an arbitrator because that would be almost nonsensical in the real world because you need one person to decide, and it's either going to be the court or the arbitrator, not both the court and the arbitrator. Is that correct?","<speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents an important question concerning the interpretation of agreements that delegate questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator. In its decision on remand, the court of appeals recognized that the arbitration agreements here contained a valid delegation, but it held that because the agreements also contained a carveout provision, they divided up responsibility for arbitrability between the arbitrator and the court. The court of appeals proceeded to decide the arbitrability question for itself, thus effectively negating the delegation altogether. That reasoning cannot possibly be correct, and Respondent does not seriously defend it. This Court should once again vacate the court of appeals' judgment. To do so, the Court need only apply two settled principles. First, a delegation is simply an antecedent agreement that is subject to the rules governing arbitration agreements more generally. Second, any doubts concerning the scope of arbitration agreements are resolved in favor of arbitration. And under that presumption, a carveout provision that does not speak to who should decide questions of arbitrability cannot restrict the parties' delegation of those questions to the arbitrator. Respondent primarily focuses not on the question presented but on another question, whether the incorporation of arbitration rules that authorize the arbitrator to resolve questions of arbitrability constitutes a valid delegation. But the Court correctly declined to add that question at the certiorari stage because 12 circuits have held without conflict that the incorporation of arbitration rules is sufficient. That holding is plainly correct, and overturning those decisions without the benefit of full briefing on both sides would work an avulsive change in the law.

22653,2020.19-963-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And, Mr. Geyser, good afternoon. First, picking up on Justice Sotomayor's questions on the incorporation of the AAA rules, you -- that's not the issue before us, but just to pause on that for a second, you referred to it as an elephant in a mouse hole. But it's really an elephant in an elephant hole. When you look at the AAA rules, Rule 7(a) says, ""the arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim."" That's very broad language, which is probably why every court of appeals to address this said that the AAA rules are an express delegation. But, again, we don't have to decide that here. That's just the premise. But I wanted to just pause on the elephant in -- in a mouse hole point. Here's -- here's the problem I think I have with your argument, and you've made it very cleverly and persuasively, but the problem is that you are suggesting that the way parties divide up arbitration -- namely, some subjects will be subject to arbitration and decided by an arbitrator and some subjects won't -- also applies to the question of who decides arbitrability. So courts will decide whether certain things are arbitrable or not, and arbitrators will decide whether other things are arbitrable. I think that's what you're saying. But that's just not how it works in the real world, nor could it realistically work that way in the real world. I don't think any contract says arbitrability shall be -- of certain subjects shall be decided by the arbitrator and others -- of other subjects by the court. Can you help me on that?

23396,2020.19-1155-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett,"Good morning, Ms. Sinzdak. I -- I have to say join me up with Justices Alito and Kagan. I'm baffled by the distinction that you're drawing between ""credibility"" and ""persuasiveness."" And it's not actually consistent with the way that I've seen cases come up for review in the court of appeals from IJs who make adverse credibility determinations. The ones I've seen, you know, they've essentially been equivalent to saying that the witness is lying. This -- this fine distinction between ""believable"" and ""believed"" just seems, you know, nitpicking to me. As Justice Kavanaugh was saying, it seems to me more like ""credibility"" refers to are they lying, and then ""persuasiveness,"" as Justice Kavanaugh was suggesting, points to other reasons why you might not believe them. So I could -- you know, thinking about your example with the child and the crumbs, I was thinking as you talked about an example about my child. I come home and find the child hysterically crying, and she said someone was beating at the door, I think somebody was trying to break into her house -- our house. And I can believe her. I don't think she's lying. But then my neighbor says, yeah, you know, I -- I saw it was the UPS man. So I would not find her story persuasive, not because of credibility but because there was other evidence that showed she was not, in fact, in danger. It was the UPS deliveryman. So I don't think that -- you -- you seem to be leaning heavily on the fact that the statute uses both the words ""credibility"" and ""persuasiveness,"" and I just don't see it. So I want to ask you what's wrong with seeing it this way: that the IJ makes a determination about credibility, and that has to be express, and when it gets up to the Board, there are two ways in which the Board might have to confront this presumption. Either the IJ actually found the alien incredible and the Board disagrees, in which case it has to confront the presumption and explain why it thinks the evidence rebuts that presumption of credibility, or the IJ might not have done a good enough job in making an adverse credibility determination explicit, as the statute requires, and then, still, the Board has to presume credibility and then explain why it thinks the presumption is rebutted. If the Board offers such an explanation, once it gets up to the court of appeals, the court of appeals isn't applying any kind of presumption. The court of appeals is just reviewing it for substantial evidence and seeing if the Board's explanation -- and the Board has to show that it understood what presumption should be there -- whether the Board's explanation was rational and substantial evidence supported its determination that the alien was not telling the truth. Is that an okay way to think about it, and how is that different from your way?","<speaker>Colleen E.

Garre</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States made a strategic decision to steer the cleanup of the Ordot Dump away from CERCLA and to sue Guam -- and sue Guam under the Clean Water Act instead, no doubt to insulate itself from liability for its own role in building and using the dump. Yet, now the United States claims that the parties' Clean Water Act settlement nevertheless triggered a CERC -- a CERCLA contribution claim, a claim under the very statute it sought to avoid. That's wrong for two independent reasons. First, Section 113(f)(3)(B) of CERCLA requires a resolution of CERCLA liability to trigger a CERCLA contribution claim. Section 113(f)(3)(B) is part of an integrated CERCLA contribution provision. Read in context, the phrase ""resolved its liability"" naturally refers to CERCLA liability, and that reading squares with traditional contribution principles, which require the resolution of a common liability. The common liability that triggers a CERCLA contribution claim is CERCLA liability. The United States' contrary interpretation depends upon construing Section 113(f)(3)(B) as if it were an island ripped from its context. It creates the untenable result that the meaning of the phrase ""resolved its liability"" changes from one paragraph of Section 113(f) to the next. And it manufactures an unprecedented contribution right that does not require a common liability and can be triggered even when the defendant is immune from liability in the settled claim, as the United States was here. None of that makes any sense. And, second, the United States' position also fails because the parties' Clean Water Act settlement simply does not resolve Guam's liability for a response action. Under the plain terms of the decree, Guam was just as exposed to liability for a response action after the decree as it was before, including under CERCLA itself.

Specifically, under the merger doctrine, there is no copyright protection for computer code that is the only way to perform those functions.

Because you agree -- you agree that you couldn't have copied their implementing code because there are multiple ways of doing that. But you fight the declaring codes because there are multiple ways of declaring as well. Apple has a different way of declaring the same functions. They spent the billions of dollars necessary. Presumably, you could have. And yet, you spent so much time in your brief convincing me that implementing and declaring codes go together in this hand. They merge.

26027,2020.18-956-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"One of the points in some of the amicus briefs -- and I want to compliment the briefing of the parties and all the amicus briefs, which have been enormously helpful -- of the 83 computer scientists is that the sky will fall, in essence, if we rule against you in this case, threaten significant disruption. One question I had about that, though, is the Federal Circuit ruled in 2014, this Court denied cert in 2015 on the first issue. I'm not aware that the sky has fallen in the last five or six years with that ruling on the books. I know it's different if we rule here, but can you respond to that?","<speaker>Thomas C. Goldstein</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The merger doctrine resolved the copyrightability question in this case. Oracle has a copyright to the computer code in Java SE but not a patent. That means that the public, not Oracle, has the right to Java SE's function, and Oracle cannot leverage its copyright to create patent-like rights. Specifically, under the merger doctrine, there is no copyright protection for computer code that is the only way to perform those functions. Here, Java software developers have the right to use certain commands to create applications for Google's Android smartphone platform, but, to work, the commands require Google to reuse an exact set of declarations from Java SE, like a key that fits into a lock. Because there are no substitutes, Oracle is impermissibly claiming the exclusive right not merely to what the declarations say but also to what the declarations do. That is not a copyright; it is a patent right. With respect to fair use, the long-settled practice of reusing software interfaces is critical to modern interoperable computer software. Here, reusing the minimally creative declarations allowed the developers to write millions of creative applications that are used by more than a billion people. But those policy questions are almost academic because the issue is not whether this Court would find fair use. The standard of review asks the much narrower question whether the jury could reasonably find fair use. Oracle now obviously regrets its demand that the jury weigh all the evidence and decide fair use in a general verdict that contains no subsidiary findings. No previous court ever held that only a court may decide fair use. It is so fact-bound that no prior appellate court ever overturned a fair use verdict. This uniquely contested case should not be the first. Today, you will hear three lawyers present legal arguments for an hour. In 2016, the jury heard the starkly conflicting testimony of almost 30 witnesses and reviewed roughly 200 exhibits over two-and-a-half weeks.

26029,2020.18-956-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Mr. Rosenkranz, let's say you want to open a restaurant. You've got a great new chef. He's got great new dishes. And you say: Well, we've got to figure out what the menu should look like. You know, of course, you're going to have, you know, appetizers first, then entrees, and then desserts. Now you shouldn't have to worry about whether that organization is copyrighted. And I think Mr. Goldstein is saying that that's what's going on -- on here. Every restaurant organizes its menu that way, and you don't want to discourage people from opening it because they're going to have to spend their own time trying to figure out what the menu should look like. Why isn't that exactly what Google is saying here?","<speaker>E. Joshua Rosenkranz</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Google's whole argument this morning is code is different. Now a few basic legal principles and concessions control the outcome of this case. Legal principle 1: Congress defined literary work to include software and granted copyright protection as long as the code is original. Google conceded Oracle's code is original. That's the end of the question. Google asks this Court to carve out declaring code, but Congress rejected the very carveout in multiple ways, including in its definition of computer program and by not including Google's carveout among the limitations in Section 117. Legal principle 2: This Court held in Harper and in Stewart that a superseding use is always unfair as a matter of law. No court has found fair use or upheld a fair use verdict where a copyist copied so much valuable expression into a competing commercial sequel to mean the same thing and serve the same purpose as the original. Google conceded the purpose and the meaning are the same. That's the end of Question 2. No one else thought that innovating required copying Sun's code without a license. As Justice Alito notes, Apple and Microsoft did not copy to create their competing platforms. Neither did others who wrote competing platforms in the Java language. There was and still is a huge market for declaring code. Other major companies, like IBM and SAP, were paying a lot of money to license just the Sun declaring code precisely because it was created. And throughout this litigation, Google never denied this. If this Court holds that a jury may conclude that copying declaring code is fair, it will encourage copying, create legal uncertainty, and decimate the business model which a lot of companies depend on, undermining the very incentives copyright was designed to promote.</text>",2020,coherent
