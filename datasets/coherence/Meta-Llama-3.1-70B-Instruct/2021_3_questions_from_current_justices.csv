Based on Franklin and Barnes, that decision is wrong. Franklin held that compensatory damages are available, and Barnes reaffirmed that holding. Emotional distress damages are the most common and often the only form of compensatory damage remedy for victims of intentional discrimination. Barnes held that remedies are available under the statutes here. They are traditionally available under contract law. Emotional distress damages are indeed recoverable in breach-of-contract cases for the type of conduct at issue here. As Section 353 of the Second Restatement and all the leading treatises cited in Barnes explain, when a contract's breach is of such a kind that serious emotional disturbance was a particularly likely result, then recovery for emotional disturbance is allowed. Premier has not and cannot dispute that serious emotional disturbance is a particularly likely result of intentional discrimination. Premier asks this Court to disregard the Restatement rule, but there is no basis to do so. The particularly-likely-result concept has been long a fixture of the law, and virtually all courts agree that in contract cases involving places of public accommodations, improper denial of access traditionally gives rise to emotional distress damages.

Premier asks this Court to disregard the Restatement rule, but there is no basis to do so. The particularly-likely-result concept has been long a fixture of the law, and virtually all courts agree that in contract cases involving places of public accommodations, improper denial of access traditionally gives rise to emotional distress damages. For all these reasons, the Court should reverse the Fifth Circuit because emotional distress damages are available under Spending Clause legislation at issue here. With that, I welcome any questions from the Court and will move to the balance of my argument.</text>",2021,incoherent

In 1964, a foreign tribunal, an international tribunal, there's a lot of evidence that it was a court or something very much like a court, and arbitration on the scale that we're talking about today was unknown. And that maybe we could rejigger the Intel factors to say you've got to ask the arbitrator first and he's got to agree or we -- we -- there's a lot of workarounds that we -- we could patch up, I suppose. That's the argument I understand you to be making. But that the government's position is, well, maybe it would like to be heard on some of these things in -- in a legislative process and that 1782 was itself a product of legislation, and the court's jurisdiction in these matters, especially involving foreign international questions, questions of comity, are usually resolved by the political branches rather than by -- by this one.

The other side says there are important distinctions that take this away from those other forms of arbitration. The first, and not unimportantly, is that the agreement doesn't create the arbitration mechanism. The agreement has to be invoked by a private party or by the government. So that's a big distinction in their mind. Others are that the parties are -- are not resolving state-to-state disputes but private litigant disputes.

Congress enacted ERISA to impose a duty Judge Friendly famously said was the highest known to the law, a fiduciary duty.

The Seventh Circuit erred by announcing a new rule that immunizes ERISA fiduciaries from suit for including imprudent options so long as some of the plan options are prudent. That holding is inconsistent with ERISA's plain text, common law principles, and this Court's precedents. In Tibble, for example, this Court held that a fiduciary has an ongoing duty to monitor fund options and to remove imprudent ones. Prudence requires fiduciaries to treat plan assets with skill and care. Respondents maintained funds in the plan with retail fees, even though the exact same investment was available with lower institutional fees. Northwestern also failed even to put its recordkeeping practices out for competitive bid or to use its enormous bargaining leverage to reduce fees. Long after universities like Cal Tech, Purdue, Pepperdine, and Loyola Marymount had reformed their plans, Northwestern finally negotiated for lower fees, made institutional share fees available, and consolidated its recordkeeping. Respondents' own actions confirm the plausibility of Petitioners' complaint. Now, if I could just start with the plain text of the statute, words in 1104 -- solely in the interest of participants, for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants, defraying reasonable expenses with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing -- those words foreclose the rule announced by the Seventh Circuit.

In Tibble, in ruling on the statute of limitations question, the Court had to provide enough content for the ongoing duty to monitor imprudent funds and to remove them and, in doing so, drew upon common law principles of trust that required similar action to remove imprudent funds. So long as some options are prudent, say the Respondents, the fiduciary cannot be sued for the imprudent ones.

The Seventh Circuit erred by announcing a new rule that immunizes ERISA fiduciaries from suit for including imprudent options so long as some of the plan options are prudent. That holding is inconsistent with ERISA's plain text, common law principles, and this Court's precedents. In Tibble, for example, this Court held that a fiduciary has an ongoing duty to monitor fund options and to remove imprudent ones. Prudence requires fiduciaries to treat plan assets with skill and care.

Northwestern also failed even to put its recordkeeping practices out for competitive bid or to use its enormous bargaining leverage to reduce fees.

Could you comment on that a bit?","<speaker>David C. Frederick</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Wasting beneficiaries' money is imprudent. Congress enacted ERISA to impose a duty Judge Friendly famously said was the highest known to the law, a fiduciary duty. Under ERISA Section 1104, a fiduciary managing assets in a retirement plan must act with prudence, solely in the interest of beneficiaries, incur only reasonable expenses, and act with care, skill, and diligence. The Seventh Circuit erred by announcing a new rule that immunizes ERISA fiduciaries from suit for including imprudent options so long as some of the plan options are prudent. That holding is inconsistent with ERISA's plain text, common law principles, and this Court's precedents. In Tibble, for example, this Court held that a fiduciary has an ongoing duty to monitor fund options and to remove imprudent ones. Prudence requires fiduciaries to treat plan assets with skill and care. Respondents maintained funds in the plan with retail fees, even though the exact same investment was available with lower institutional fees. Northwestern also failed even to put its recordkeeping practices out for competitive bid or to use its enormous bargaining leverage to reduce fees. Long after universities like Cal Tech, Purdue, Pepperdine, and Loyola Marymount had reformed their plans, Northwestern finally negotiated for lower fees, made institutional share fees available, and consolidated its recordkeeping. Respondents' own actions confirm the plausibility of Petitioners' complaint. Now, if I could just start with the plain text of the statute, words in 1104 -- solely in the interest of participants, for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants, defraying reasonable expenses with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing -- those words foreclose the rule announced by the Seventh Circuit. It is not in the sole and exclusive interest of participants to have to sift through imprudent funds in order to determine which ones are the prudent ones, and yet that is the implication of the Seventh Circuit's rule and the position that the Respondents advance here. In Tibble, in ruling on the statute of limitations question, the Court had to provide enough content for the ongoing duty to monitor imprudent funds and to remove them and, in doing so, drew upon common law principles of trust that required similar action to remove imprudent funds. So long as some options are prudent, say the Respondents, the fiduciary cannot be sued for the imprudent ones. But that principle provides no check on a fiduciary, and it provides no check on inaction or a failure to act in the best interest of the participants. Nor is there a limiting approach or limiting principle to the Respondents' approach. They say on page 25 of their brief that one rotten fund would be enough to give rise to a potential breach of fiduciary duty. But where do you draw the line after that? The Respondents don't give any type of answer to that question, and there is none. In our position, we pleaded here plausible claims for a breach of fiduciary duty. In October of 2016, Respondents' own actions confirmed the plausibility of the allegations that they had breached their prior -- fiduciary duties prior to that time. They finally consolidated their recordkeeper. They finally lowered fees. They finally made institutional share classes available. The complaint gives ample detail about all of these allegations, compared to what the industry norms were at the time and compared to other universities who had acted six years, in some instances, before Northwestern finally got around to responding to the 2007 Department of Labor rule change, which was seeking to bring 403(b) plans into accordance and alignment with 401(k) plans.

I basically said, are you defending a position that says you can insulate yourself from a suit that says you're acting imprudently, you, the fiduciary, by saying no, some of the investments that we offer in our plan are prudent and they have reasonable fees and so you can't attack us for having unreasonable investments with unreasonable fees?","<speaker>David C. Frederick</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Wasting beneficiaries' money is imprudent. Congress enacted ERISA to impose a duty Judge Friendly famously said was the highest known to the law, a fiduciary duty. Under ERISA Section 1104, a fiduciary managing assets in a retirement plan must act with prudence, solely in the interest of beneficiaries, incur only reasonable expenses, and act with care, skill, and diligence. The Seventh Circuit erred by announcing a new rule that immunizes ERISA fiduciaries from suit for including imprudent options so long as some of the plan options are prudent. That holding is inconsistent with ERISA's plain text, common law principles, and this Court's precedents. In Tibble, for example, this Court held that a fiduciary has an ongoing duty to monitor fund options and to remove imprudent ones. Prudence requires fiduciaries to treat plan assets with skill and care. Respondents maintained funds in the plan with retail fees, even though the exact same investment was available with lower institutional fees. Northwestern also failed even to put its recordkeeping practices out for competitive bid or to use its enormous bargaining leverage to reduce fees. Long after universities like Cal Tech, Purdue, Pepperdine, and Loyola Marymount had reformed their plans, Northwestern finally negotiated for lower fees, made institutional share fees available, and consolidated its recordkeeping. Respondents' own actions confirm the plausibility of Petitioners' complaint. Now, if I could just start with the plain text of the statute, words in 1104 -- solely in the interest of participants, for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants, defraying reasonable expenses with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing -- those words foreclose the rule announced by the Seventh Circuit. It is not in the sole and exclusive interest of participants to have to sift through imprudent funds in order to determine which ones are the prudent ones, and yet that is the implication of the Seventh Circuit's rule and the position that the Respondents advance here. In Tibble, in ruling on the statute of limitations question, the Court had to provide enough content for the ongoing duty to monitor imprudent funds and to remove them and, in doing so, drew upon common law principles of trust that required similar action to remove imprudent funds. So long as some options are prudent, say the Respondents, the fiduciary cannot be sued for the imprudent ones. But that principle provides no check on a fiduciary, and it provides no check on inaction or a failure to act in the best interest of the participants.

The analysis thus asks not only whether the two law-giving entities draw their authority from separate sovereigns but also whether the two law-enforcing entities do so. The government disagrees.

Assault, for an example, is an offense under both tribal law and the BIA's regulatory criminal code. According to the government, if Petitioner had gone to trial rather than taking a plea on the tribal offense and he had been acquitted, the very same prosecutor would have been free the very next day to bring a successive prosecution for a substantively identical offense, this time having honed his case and refined his proof based on the lessons learned in the first prosecution.

Kimberly</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Double Jeopardy Clause implicates two distinct exercises of sovereign authority: first, the authority to say what an offense is, and, second, the authority to put an individual in jeopardy for committing an offense. This Court has consistently assumed the importance to the dual-sovereignty doctrine of both expressions of sovereign power. The analysis thus asks not only whether the two law-giving entities draw their authority from separate sovereigns but also whether the two law-enforcing entities do so. The government disagrees. It says that the separateness of the offense-defining entities is all that matters. But that position would invite the precise abuses that the Double Jeopardy Clause was intended to prevent, and the CFR courts themselves provide the evidence. Assault, for an example, is an offense under both tribal law and the BIA's regulatory criminal code. According to the government, if Petitioner had gone to trial rather than taking a plea on the tribal offense and he had been acquitted, the very same prosecutor would have been free the very next day to bring a successive prosecution for a substantively identical offense, this time having honed his case and refined his proof based on the lessons learned in the first prosecution. That is not an outcome that the framers of the Double Jeopardy Clause would have thought tolerable. In arguing otherwise, the government focuses on a single word, ""offense,"" which it takes entirely in isolation and to which it applies rigid dictionary definitions. But the Bill of Rights prevents not only transgressions of the amendment's literal terms but also governmental efforts to circumvent their protections. Blockburger itself embodies this anti-circumvention principle. It holds that technically different defenses codified in different code sections comprising different elements nonetheless may constitute conceptually the same offense for double jeopardy purposes when, for example, one is a lesser included of the other. And our position is that the same Blockburger rule ought to apply anytime a single sovereign undertakes successive prosecutions, regardless whether separate sovereigns have defined the respective offenses.

For nearly two centuries, this Court has recognized that the clause only prohibits two prosecutions for the same offense and that violating the law of one sovereign is not the same offense as violating the law of another. The Court also has held that the tribes and the federal government are separate sovereigns for these purposes because they derive their power to prescribe conduct from different sources of authority. Indeed, there's no question in this case that if Petitioner had been convicted of his tribal offense in a tribally operated court, his double jeopardy claim would fail, no matter how much assistance that fed -- that tribally operated court received. Petitioner argues for a different result here only because the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe made the sovereign choice for its tribal code to be enforced in a Court of Indian Offenses.

Ross</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner's violent sexual assault violated the laws of both the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe and the federal government. Petitioner thus committed two offenses, and the Double Jeopardy Clause poses no bar to two prosecutions. For nearly two centuries, this Court has recognized that the clause only prohibits two prosecutions for the same offense and that violating the law of one sovereign is not the same offense as violating the law of another. The Court also has held that the tribes and the federal government are separate sovereigns for these purposes because they derive their power to prescribe conduct from different sources of authority. Indeed, there's no question in this case that if Petitioner had been convicted of his tribal offense in a tribally operated court, his double jeopardy claim would fail, no matter how much assistance that fed -- that tribally operated court received. Petitioner argues for a different result here only because the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe made the sovereign choice for its tribal code to be enforced in a Court of Indian Offenses.

And if that is the case -- well, that's what I want to know. Is it really anything goes? So suppose you -- there -- what we had in this case was quintuple hearsay about something that Tamerlan supposedly did years ago in Russia. One person in Russia told another person in Russia, who told another person in Russia, down the line, that he did certain things. And that is admitted. Then what can you do in response? Can you then introduce evidence to show that it actually didn't happen? Or can you introduce evidence to impeach the credibility of some of these hearsay declarants?

First, the district court violated the First Circuit's longstanding voir dire supervisory rule by refusing to learn whether jurors had been exposed to inadmissible and inflammatory publicity that could prejudice their consideration of the death penalty. Second and more fundamentally, the district court violated the Eighth Amendment by categorically excluding evidence that Tamerlan robbed and murdered three people as an act of jihad. That evidence was central to the mitigation case. The -- the defense's entire argument was that Dzhokhar was less culpable because Tamerlan indoctrinated him and then led the bombings. Tamerlan's commission of the murders supplied the key indoctrinating event by demonstrating to Dzhokhar that Tamerlan had irrevocably committed himself to violent jihad. That would have had a profound effect on Dzhokhar, who was already enthralled to his brother and therefore would have felt intense pressure to follow Tamerlan's chosen path and to accept extremist violence as justified, and Tamerlan's prior experience carrying out violent jihad made him more likely to have led the bombings. The evidence's exclusion distorted the penalty phase here by enabling the government to present a deeply misleading account of the key issues of influence and leadership. The government argued that Tamerlan was merely bossy. The Waltham evidence showed that wasn't true. The government argued that Tamerlan did no more than send Dzhokhar a few extremist articles. The Waltham evidence showed that wasn't true. The government argued that the brothers were equal partners because Tamerlan had not succeeded in jihad until Dzhokhar joined him.

So I think another way to think about Justice Alito's question is, is this part of the Federal Death Penalty Act inconsistent with the Eighth Amendment, or do you think that that sentence in the Federal Death Penalty Act is a legitimate ground for excluding evidence?","<speaker>Ginger D. Anders</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under the Constitution, a death sentence is lawful only if it reflects a reliable and reasoned moral judgment to the offense and the defendant's culpability. That bedrock principle was violated in two ways here. First, the district court violated the First Circuit's longstanding voir dire supervisory rule by refusing to learn whether jurors had been exposed to inadmissible and inflammatory publicity that could prejudice their consideration of the death penalty. Second and more fundamentally, the district court violated the Eighth Amendment by categorically excluding evidence that Tamerlan robbed and murdered three people as an act of jihad. That evidence was central to the mitigation case. The -- the defense's entire argument was that Dzhokhar was less culpable because Tamerlan indoctrinated him and then led the bombings. Tamerlan's commission of the murders supplied the key indoctrinating event by demonstrating to Dzhokhar that Tamerlan had irrevocably committed himself to violent jihad. That would have had a profound effect on Dzhokhar, who was already enthralled to his brother and therefore would have felt intense pressure to follow Tamerlan's chosen path and to accept extremist violence as justified, and Tamerlan's prior experience carrying out violent jihad made him more likely to have led the bombings. The evidence's exclusion distorted the penalty phase here by enabling the government to present a deeply misleading account of the key issues of influence and leadership. The government argued that Tamerlan was merely bossy. The Waltham evidence showed that wasn't true. The government argued that Tamerlan did no more than send Dzhokhar a few extremist articles. The Waltham evidence showed that wasn't true. The government argued that the brothers were equal partners because Tamerlan had not succeeded in jihad until Dzhokhar joined him. The Waltham evidence showed that wasn't true either. But the defense couldn't make any of those points. A sentencing proceeding where the defense is not permitted to make its fundamental mitigation argument and to rebut the government's aggravation arguments cannot result in a reliable and constitutional death sentence. Now I'd just like to start where the Court left off with my friend, Mr. Feigin, with the government's acknowledgment that this evidence should have come in. If -- if -- if Dzhokhar knew about it and if there was evidence that Tamerlan did it, I think that's exactly right. But the key point here is that the test for relevance is the permissible inferences that the jury can draw from this evidence. And so I think the district court committed legal error here by saying that -- that the evidence lacked any probative value at all, and I don't understand the government to defend that position. I think the far stronger inference here from the evidence was that, in fact, Tamerlan had a significant role in these murders. We know that because not only did Todashev say that, but there's ample corroborating evidence which we've gone through in our brief that starts with Dzhokhar's own statement to his friend that Tamerlan committed these murders and committed them as an act of jihad. He would not have said that if this had been a minor role. We know that Tamerlan was the one to review just a few weeks before the murders the extremist teachings of Anwar al-Awlaki, advocating robbing non-believers as a form of jihad. That provided the extremist motivation for this offense. We know that Tamerlan was the one who knew Brendan Mess, the primary victim here. There was no evidence that Todashev did. And, of course, Tamerlan's involvement is corroborated by a computer search history which shows that either Tamerlan or his wife within a few days of the murders searched for Tamerlan's name in connection with the murders.

A second theory, which I think you're emphasizing more here, is the mere fact that Tamerlan committed another murder is itself relevant.

I mean, as you said, Manuel identifies the constitutional claim and then Manuel says, look, our standard practice when we have a 1983 suit raising that claim is to ask what the most analogous claim at the common law was. And as to that question, Manuel says we're not deciding, we're going to kick it back down, nobody's really addressed that. Now it turns out almost all the circuit courts have answered that question by saying, you know, the most analogous claim is the malicious prosecution, the old malicious prosecution claim, and that comes with a favorable termination rule, and then you have a split growing out of that, which is like what is that favorable termination rule. So one way we could decide this is just to say: We're still not deciding what the most analogous common law tort is. We're just sort of going to assume what basically every circuit court has held, which is that it's the malicious prosecution tort which is -- is the most analogous and that that comes with a favorable termination element. And now we'll tell you, given that everybody is doing the case -- the cases in this way, what that favorable termination route is -- rule is. We could decide it that way.

Roberts, Jr.","Counsel, there -- as you can tell from the questioning, there's a real issue in this case about whether we should be deciding essentially a downstream question when we haven't resolved an upstream question, and that's one of your arguments in favor of dismissing, I guess. But it's kind of a feature of our jurisdiction that we sometimes will do that. I mean, if you have a particular question of whether there's a claim, and then -- a downstream question like what the elements are, well, it may be a serious issue that has divided the courts of appeals, you know, what the elements should be. And we may look at the prior question, the upstream question, and decide that that may not be ripe for our consideration at this time. It may be ripe later on. You know, the two questions might have had different treatment in the -- in the different circuits so that one conflict is ripe and the other is not. I mean, do we have to wait until the upstream question is suitable for our jurisdiction before a direct -- addressing, say, a sharp conflict in the circuits? We don't have quite that here, but, you know, the circuits are divided five to five on the elements. But we think the upstream question would benefit from further percolation before we grab it?

And it seems as though you've abandoned that, but what should we do with that provision in this case?","<speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Secretary of Homeland Security exercised his statutory discretion to make a policy judgment. He found that the benefits of MPP were outweighed by its domestic, humanitarian, and foreign policy costs. Yet, the lower courts ordered DHS to reinstate MPP in perpetuity, requiring ongoing negotiations with Mexico to send thousands of non-citizens into its territory. That was error. On the first question, Section 1225 confers a discretionary return authority that the Secretary may use, not a mandate. Nothing in the statutory text or history compels DHS to use MPP whenever Congress fails to provide sufficient funds for universal detention. Respondents identify no one who interpreted Section 1225 this way before this lawsuit, no member of Congress or executive branch official or anyone else. And on this reading, every presidential administration, in an unbroken line for the past quarter century, has been in open violation of the INA. The courts' interpretation compels sensitive foreign policy negotiations and would require transformative changes to the government's border operations. If Congress had wanted to mandate those results, it would have spoken clearly. On the second question, Respondents have abandoned virtually all of the district court's reasons for -- and the Fifth Circuit's reasons for finding that the October 29 termination decision has no legal effect.

36888,2021.21-954-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"Well, I'll just ask a couple questions in case we reach it. There were two parts of the explanation in the October memo that jumped out to me as potentially State Farm-type issues. One is that you said -- the -- the memo says that the choice to bring people into the country is because, otherwise, other more dangerous people would come into the country. In other words, you have a choice between the less dangerous or more dangerous coming into the country. That's on page 28 of the memo. And that strikes me as a false choice because the other option, of course, is to send people to Mexico. So that's one issue. The other issue is I don't see -- and this follows up on Justice Barrett's questions -- any real explanation in the October memo of what ""public"" means and ""significant public benefit."" Is that the American public? Is that the non-citizen public? Who is that? And if it's the American public, there's no real explanation of how the public is benefitted by more people coming into the United States who are not lawfully admitted into the United States rather than trying, if feasible, for some of those people to remain in Mexico.

And as you say, Congress has expressed a preference for detention, and capacity is -- is a limit on that and -- and it seems like the primary driver of your assessment of significant public benefit. I guess my question is, on the case-by-case basis, when DHS assesses whether any individual non-citizen -- whether there would be a significant public benefit to release and parole rather than send back to Mexico or other contiguous territory, what is the benefit? Is that a limit -- you know, the Chief Justice said that if you're only considering capacity, that's a pretty capacious term and there might not be any limit.

Here are 20 things that you need to do for us. Or maybe Mexico says: No, we'd like to see you squirm and not be able to comply with the Court's order, and so we won't allow you to do the program regardless.

The other is to return, rather than to detain, certain aliens under 1182(b)(2)(C).

Geyser</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question presented is whether Vaden's look-through approach applies to applications to enforce or vacate an arbitration award under Sections 9 and 10 of the Federal Arbitration Act. The answer is controlled by the FAA's plain text, and the competing statutory arguments are not close. The look-through approach is no ordinary jurisdictional doctrine. It is an express textual departure from the well-pleaded complaint rule. This textual exception is found solely in Section 4. It applies exclusively to petitions under that single section. Congress did not repeat this unique language anywhere else in the Act. In fact, there's not a single textual hint in any other section that a look-through analysis is allowed or appropriate.

37674,2021.20-1143-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas,"Ms. Blatt, would you comment on Petitioner's assessment of your Section 4 venue argument?","<speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If federal courts would have jurisdiction over the parties' underlying dispute, federal courts can hear motions to confirm or vacate arbitral awards resolving that dispute. First, the FAA's text treats requests to confirm or vacate arbitral awards as motions. Motions are not free-standing lawsuits that need an independent jurisdictional basis. Rather, motions seek relief within a larger controversy between the parties. Courts thus assess their jurisdiction by looking to that underlying controversy. Here, the FAA is structured sequentially to facilitate all stages of arbitration to resolve the same underlying controversy. Because FAA motions are adjuncts to that broader controversy, federal courts can hear FAA motions when they have jurisdiction over that controversy. Second, Petitioner's approach would decapitate the FAA. The Act pervasively refers to federal courts. But, in Petitioner's world, federal courts can't hear most Section 9 and 10 motions. They don't on their face raise federal questions. And most of the motions wouldn't satisfy diversity jurisdiction either, like ubiquitous zero dollar awards that reject the plaintiff's claim. And uncontested motions to confirm would fail adversarialness under Article III. Petitioner says state courts are equally good. But, unlike the FAA's standards for confirmation and vacatur, state courts often revisit the merits under their own state arbitration acts. Congress presumably did not want federal courts to enforce arbitration agreements at the front end, only to see state courts to force do-overs at the back end. And, third, it's implausible the FAA imposes one jurisdictional test for motions under Section 4 and a different jurisdictional test for motions under Sections 5, 7, 9, 10, and 11.

But -- but -- but you need some kind of jurisdictional hook, don't you? I mean, Congress didn't just expect everybody to understand that this was look-through jurisdiction.

The question is whether a state has authority to prosecute non-Indians who commit crimes in Indian country, regardless of whether the victim is a non-Indian or an Indian. The answer to that question is yes. The state has inherent sovereign authority to punish crimes committed within its borders, and no federal law preempts that authority as to crimes committed by non-Indians.

And as this Court has also explained, Public Law 280 simply expanded the criminal and civil jurisdiction of qualifying states. It did not somehow divest all states of preexisting jurisdiction. The mere fact that some members of Congress may have believed that the states would otherwise have lacked jurisdiction over certain crimes does not give the law preemptive effect. Because this case does not implicate a tribe's right to govern itself and to punish tribal offenders, the Court need not resort to the more flexible balancing approach that it has used elsewhere.

George Washington wrote letters about this at the outset of the -- the nation's history. In the 1920s, Oklahoma systematically used its state courts to deprive Indians of their -- their property when oil was discovered on their lands. There's a long history of this. Congress has provided as well a mechanism for tribes who wish to opt in to state concurrent jurisdiction in Public Law 280, so that's available. We know that. They've chosen not to. Should that be something we consider? And then, finally, two more things. We have the treaties, okay, which have been in existence and promising this tribe since before the Trail of Tears that they would not be subject to state jurisdiction precisely because the states were known to be their enemies. Does that count in -- in your balancing -- your new Bracker balancing test which we've never heretofore applied in criminal law?

And I will lay out there's an article in The Atlantic that suggests that your figures are grossly exaggerated, and I want to give you an opportunity to address that. But put that question aside. It may be that you and some -- that you're the only state that wants concurrent jurisdiction to fix a state-specific problem. But why should we assume that every other state wants that responsibility? And doesn't conferring jurisdiction on a state or telling it you have concurrent jurisdiction obligate that state in a way to protect its Indian victims? I mean, what you're saying is an unfunded mandate to 49 other states to take on a responsibility that they had a choice to take on and most of them didn't want. So we have 11 states for which Congress enacted state-specific legislation conferring some jurisdiction. In Public Law 280, again, states were given the choice, do you want to prosecute these crimes or not? Three more states added onto the 11, so 15 only, given a choice, wanted to do this. We are told by some amici that federal and state authorities have come to agreement in virtually every place outside of Oklahoma as to who's going to do what. But, once we say states have concurrent jurisdiction, we are forcing the state to do something. You're saying, no, no, no, there's always prosecutorial discretion. But is that true? They have an obligation to treat their citizens equally. Having said that, this is not a case -- what you're doing is putting all of those 15 laws conferring different kinds of jurisdiction on those states into question. You're throwing out those 15 agreements and you're saying forget what they say about limiting state jurisdiction or not. States had an inherent power to do this. Maybe you'll come back and say, well, those are agreements, so they're still bound by them. But now you're creating chaos across the country, 49 other states. And I am told that the federal government decides whether to put some resources in some places based on what kind of jurisdiction exists with the states and not in others.

Respondent relies on two statutes, the General Crimes Act and Public Law 280. But neither of those statutes says anything about preemption. As this Court has explained, the General Crimes Act merely incorporates the substantive criminal law that applies in federal enclaves. It does not go further and address state jurisdiction. And as this Court has also explained, Public Law 280 simply expanded the criminal and civil jurisdiction of qualifying states. It did not somehow divest all states of preexisting jurisdiction. The mere fact that some members of Congress may have believed that the states would otherwise have lacked jurisdiction over certain crimes does not give the law preemptive effect. Because this case does not implicate a tribe's right to govern itself and to punish tribal offenders, the Court need not resort to the more flexible balancing approach that it has used elsewhere. But, here, any balancing weighs heavily in the state's favor. The state has a paramount interest in ensuring public safety. And concurrent state and federal jurisdiction would only enhance law enforcement in Indian country, especially because the tribes ordinarily lack jurisdiction over non-Indian offenders. The federal government now takes the position that it should have exclusive jurisdiction.

The question is whether a state has authority to prosecute non-Indians who commit crimes in Indian country, regardless of whether the victim is a non-Indian or an Indian. The answer to that question is yes. The state has inherent sovereign authority to punish crimes committed within its borders, and no federal law preempts that authority as to crimes committed by non-Indians. Respondent relies on two statutes, the General Crimes Act and Public Law 280. But neither of those statutes says anything about preemption.

And as this Court has also explained, Public Law 280 simply expanded the criminal and civil jurisdiction of qualifying states. It did not somehow divest all states of preexisting jurisdiction. The mere fact that some members of Congress may have believed that the states would otherwise have lacked jurisdiction over certain crimes does not give the law preemptive effect.

The question is whether a state has authority to prosecute non-Indians who commit crimes in Indian country, regardless of whether the victim is a non-Indian or an Indian. The answer to that question is yes. The state has inherent sovereign authority to punish crimes committed within its borders, and no federal law preempts that authority as to crimes committed by non-Indians. Respondent relies on two statutes, the General Crimes Act and Public Law 280. But neither of those statutes says anything about preemption. As this Court has explained, the General Crimes Act merely incorporates the substantive criminal law that applies in federal enclaves. It does not go further and address state jurisdiction. And as this Court has also explained, Public Law 280 simply expanded the criminal and civil jurisdiction of qualifying states. It did not somehow divest all states of preexisting jurisdiction. The mere fact that some members of Congress may have believed that the states would otherwise have lacked jurisdiction over certain crimes does not give the law preemptive effect.

It does not. In the Restoration Act, Congress codified the Cabazon Band framework and specifically foreclosed Texas's regulatory authority over the tribe's gaming activities. The plain language of the Act provides us with clear support for this interpretation. On the heels of this Court's decision in Cabazon, Congress changed the language of the Restoration Act to replicate the prohibitory/ regulatory dichotomy struck in Cabazon. Section 107(a) incorporates the Cabazon framework. It federalizes Texas law but only as to prohibited games. And bingo, in the State of Texas, is not a prohibited game. Section 107(b) clearly forecloses any interpretation of Section 107 in its entirety where Texas would have regulatory jurisdiction over tribal gaming. And Section 107(b) must have meaning in the Act. The problem with the State of Texas's interpretation and the Fifth Circuit's interpretation in Ysleta I is that it reads 107(b) out of the Act entirely. This interpretation is also consistent with Congress's extension of the Cabazon framework to IGRA. The two statutes are not in conflict, and you don't have to choose one over the other.

Martin</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question this case presents is whether the Restoration Act subjects the Pueblo to Texas's time, place, and manner restrictions as it relates to games that Texas does not flatly prohibit. It does not. In the Restoration Act, Congress codified the Cabazon Band framework and specifically foreclosed Texas's regulatory authority over the tribe's gaming activities. The plain language of the Act provides us with clear support for this interpretation. On the heels of this Court's decision in Cabazon, Congress changed the language of the Restoration Act to replicate the prohibitory/ regulatory dichotomy struck in Cabazon. Section 107(a) incorporates the Cabazon framework. It federalizes Texas law but only as to prohibited games. And bingo, in the State of Texas, is not a prohibited game. Section 107(b) clearly forecloses any interpretation of Section 107 in its entirety where Texas would have regulatory jurisdiction over tribal gaming. And Section 107(b) must have meaning in the Act. The problem with the State of Texas's interpretation and the Fifth Circuit's interpretation in Ysleta I is that it reads 107(b) out of the Act entirely. This interpretation is also consistent with Congress's extension of the Cabazon framework to IGRA. The two statutes are not in conflict, and you don't have to choose one over the other. And even if that were the case, and we don't think it is, the plain language of the Restoration Act allows my client to engage in non-prohibited gaming activities.
