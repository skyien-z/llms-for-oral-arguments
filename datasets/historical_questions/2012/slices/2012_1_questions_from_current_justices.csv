Rothfeld</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the Red River Compact, Oklahoma agreed that Texas would be allowed to use a specified quantity of water that is located in Oklahoma. Oklahoma is now trying to back out of that bargain. What its argument to this Court in support of its position is essentially that the Court should disregard language that appears in the Red River Compact because that language is superfluous, that the Court should read into the Compact language that does not appear there, and that the Court should not give the text of the Compact what Oklahoma in its brief describes as talismanic significance. Our very different view is that the plain text of the Compact must control. Now, in the Red River Compact, Texas and Oklahoma, along with Louisiana and Arkansas, agreed to allocate among themselves the waters of the Red River Basin. The Compact divides that basin into large areas called reaches and subdivides the reaches into subbasins. As to some of those areas, the Compact expressly allocates entitlement to water by State line. It says that the States may use the water within their boundaries exclusively. But in the section of the Compact which is at issue here, Reach 2, Subbasin 5, the Compact uses a very different and unique language. That section -- that subbasin includes the territory of three of the four compacting States. The boundaries of that subbasin are drawn not by State lines, but by reference to the -- the last downside dam sites before tributaries to the Red River Basin -- Red River flow into the river itself.</text>",2012

I don't know of a lawyer who would say the following to himself: I'm not going to make this objection because I'm just going to assume that sometime between now and my direct appeal the law is going to change, and it's going to change in my favor, and when it changes, I'm going to be able to make this objection and get over not only prong two but prong three and four of the test, and life will be grand for my client.

I mean, this -- basically, what you're saying is we reward the circuits and the judges who don't reach issues, because if the law is unsettled, then if a substantial right is affected, that's so serious that it affects the fairness and integrity of a proceeding, that is not going to result in a reversal.

The argument was that you couldn't get a utility patent because the Plant Variety Protection Act implicitly repealed the Patent Act in that respect. This Court rejected that argument, and the reason it rejected that argument was because it found no conflict between the two statutes. The reason it found no conflict between the two statutes is because it said that it is harder to get a utility patent, and for that reason, you get greater protection -- under the Patent Act, you get greater rights of exclusion under the Patent Act than you do under the PVPA.

So your client obtained nothing of value for himself. He didn't get anything transferred to him. And that -- that argument makes eminent sense to me.

What it said is you have to follow the terms of the permit and make the permittee responsible only for their excess discharges, and you haven't shown us any evidence that does that. The Ninth Circuit agreed that the permittee is only liable for its own discharges. It held the permittee liable because it believed that the discharges were within their source, within their outflow.

We're starting out with the power of Congress to make rules for the regulation of the military. And one of the things that they want to do in making those rules is to make military installations acceptable to the local communities where they are located. They know from experience, for example, it's happened in Okinawa, that when have you military personnel who go -- who commit sex offenses with people off base, it can cause tremendous opposition. And this is what happened here; not the opposition, but an offense involving a 15-year-old girl who lived off the base. So in order to ensure that there -- we don't have excessive civilian opposition to the location of military bases, we are going to do a number of things. One thing is we're going to criminally prosecute members of the military who commit these offenses. This will deter; this will incapacitate. But also, to provide further assurance to the community that these people are not going to be dangerous, we are going to require them to register.

Verrilli, Jr.</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There's a fundamental point that needs to be made at the outset. Everyone acknowledges, Petitioner, its amici, this Court in Northwest Austin, that the Voting Rights Act made a huge difference in transforming the culture of blatantly racist vote suppression that characterized parts of this country for a century. Section 5 preclearance was the principal engine of that progress. And it has always been true that only a tiny fraction of submissions under Section 5 result in objections. So that progress under Section 5 that follows from that has been as a result of the deterrence and the constraint Section 5 imposes on States and subjurisdictions and not on the actual enforcement by means of objection. Now, when Congress faced the question whether to reauthorize Section 5 in 2006, it had to decide whether -- whether it could be confident that the attitudes and behaviors in covered jurisdictions had changed enough that that very effective constraint and deterrence could be confidently removed.

And, you know, it would not be crazy to surmise that we reformulated the question because we wanted to present, we wanted to decide a legal question, rather than a question about who was right as to this particular expert's report and how strong it was.

35634,2012.11-597-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"I guess the problem with this case, and it's part of what's interwoven in your adversary's arguments, is that with flooding it's going to occur naturally anyway. The Government generally builds dams to control that flooding to the benefit of all of the interests along its affected route. And at some point, either the Government is going to -- is going to make a decision that's going to help someone and potentially hurt someone. And the question is, is in all of those situations going to be subject to litigation. The Government's rule -- I call it the Government's rule, but it's -- is basically simple. It can't. Because, if the deviation is temporary -- and that's what the circuit below said -- it's just exercise. It's either a nuisance or temporary trespass, and we're not going to hold the Government responsible for that loss. Assuming it's going to occur in part because flooding is always going to occur, the question is perhaps when. But in any place you have a dam, it's there because flooding was happening. Isn't that the basic argument? And I don't know that you've actually announced the rule that addresses the essence of the policy considerations that are driving the government decision.

But why isn't this the fingerprinting of the 21st century? What is the difference?
