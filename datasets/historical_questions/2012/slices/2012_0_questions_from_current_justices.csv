1124,2012.11-9335-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan,"Well, you said, Mr. Dreeben, and -- and I think it's -- it's a great question: Is the jury functioning as a low level gatekeeper under the Harris rule? Because I could make the argument that in fact it is. You know, you take a statute and it says, 5 and up for carrying, and 7 and up for brandishing, right? And this isn't even a hypothetical. This is pretty close to this case. It goes to the jury, the jury says we think he was carrying, we do not think that he was brandishing, all right? And then it goes to the judge. And now the judge says, you know what, if I had my druthers, I would only give 5 years. If I had my druthers, I absolutely would defer to the jury verdict, but I can't defer to the jury verdict because Congress has said I have to make this special factfinding, and the truth of the matter is I think he did brandish, and so I have to give 7 years. So the judge is not deferring to the jury, and he's not deferring to the jury when he would prefer to do so. I guess the question is: Isn't that in every practical sense -- doesn't the mandatory minimum effectively increase the maximum punishment that the -- that the defendant otherwise would get?","<speaker>Michael R.

1125,2012.11-9335-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Dreeben, can I go back to a point you made earlier? You talked about a legislature not attempting to supplant the jury's role on the maximum. You don't see the same danger -- we started out in a country where almost all sentencing was in the discretion of the judge; whatever crime you committed, the judge could decide where to sentence you. As Apprendi and its subsequent progeny laid out, these sentencing changes that have come into existence have really come into existence the latter half of the last century. What -- don't you fear that at some point the legislature will go back to the old system of supplanting the jury by just saying what it said in 924(c)? Every single crime has a maximum of life. And all the -- and every single fact that's going to set a real sentence for the defendant, a minimum, we're going to let the judge decide by a preponderance of the evidence. The bottom line of my question is, when Apprendi was decided, what should be the driving force of protecting the jury system? The deprivation of discretion, whether that's permissible or not, or whether a sentence is fixed in a range, whatever it might be, by a jury?","<speaker>Michael R.

It's different than the one the State suggests, but it would go something like this: There is an allocation that has to be made. In making allocations there are two ways of doing it. We can do it case-by-case, individualized decisionmaking; or we can use some bright-line rules. And the advantage of bright-line rules is that they are cheap and efficient and sometimes they are not more inaccurate than individualized decisionmaking, because in individualized decisionmaking you can maker errors, too. So this is a reasonable way to make an allocation decision.

Did they pay too little on the floatation value, or did they make too much money? And what the government says -- rightly -- is, whether you paid too much or too little money depends on the value of the company.

The one thing that the parties in this case seem to agree on is that marriage is very important. It's thought to be a fundamental building block of society and its preservation essential for the preservation of society. Traditional marriage has been around for thousands of years. Same-sex marriage is very new. I think it was first adopted in The Netherlands in 2000. So there isn't a lot of data about its effect. And it may turn out to be a -- a good thing; it may turn out not to be a good thing, as the supporters of Proposition 8 apparently believe.

Has the agency acted in accordance with that -- under that lawmaking power? Well, then, the agency gets deference. We go on to the next thing, which is Step 1 and Step 2. So, you know, what we don't do is this sort of provision by provision, subsection by subsection, did Congress have a special intent as to this subject matter or that subject matter or the other subject matter?

You seem to be proposing what appears to me to be a much broader rule that says -- at one point in your brief you state that it is the occupant's observed connection to a home subject to a valid warrant, not his physical location at the time that he is detained, that makes him subject to detention. Now, I know police when they're executing warrants often have an advance team that has been surveilling a home, sometimes for days. And they've got one officer sitting there, and they see who they think is the occupant leave, and the team doesn't arrive till 12 hours later. Is it your position that in that circumstance the officers are authorized to go to wherever the defend -- wherever the occupant is, the office, the -- wherever he might be, his mother's home, and effect an arrest there?","<speaker>Jeffrey B.

Horwich</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to start maybe at a point in a colloquy that my friend was having with Justice Breyer, which brought out the point that Petitioner's position here is that there's a difference between alternative elements in State crimes and alternative means; and from the point of view of a guilty plea, which is what we're dealing with here, I don't see how you're going to make that sort of distinction. It's an unworkable distinction, because, from -- from the point of view of the defendant pleading guilty, whether it's an alternative element or an alternative means, it's just an alternative way of offering the factual basis for the crime. And the sentencing court ought to look, as the Court, as this Court said in Shepard, to the factual basis that's offered for pleading guilty.</text>",2012

Johnson</speaker><text>May it -- Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: In this case it doesn't matter what my client was convicted of in 1978 in the State of California. What's important for the Armed Career Criminal Act is what he's convicted of. And as we all know, when you're -- to be convicted of a crime, elements have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt or agreed to by a defendant after waiving his constitutional rights. In California, burglary -- unlawful entry as defined by the Court in Taylor on what a generic burglary consists of, is not an element of California burglary. Any entry with the intent to commit a crime, a theft, or a felony will do. A California jury is never required to actually find unlawful entry in the Taylor sense. Regardless of the defendant's conduct, a California burglary conviction is not by its elements Taylor burglary for Armed Career Criminal Act.</text>",2012

19384,2012.11-889-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","I guess what I'm asking is, does the Compact give Texas special priority apart from what Oklahoma -- Oklahoma's priorities would be?","<speaker>Charles A. Rothfeld</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the Red River Compact, Oklahoma agreed that Texas would be allowed to use a specified quantity of water that is located in Oklahoma. Oklahoma is now trying to back out of that bargain. What its argument to this Court in support of its position is essentially that the Court should disregard language that appears in the Red River Compact because that language is superfluous, that the Court should read into the Compact language that does not appear there, and that the Court should not give the text of the Compact what Oklahoma in its brief describes as talismanic significance. Our very different view is that the plain text of the Compact must control. Now, in the Red River Compact, Texas and Oklahoma, along with Louisiana and Arkansas, agreed to allocate among themselves the waters of the Red River Basin. The Compact divides that basin into large areas called reaches and subdivides the reaches into subbasins. As to some of those areas, the Compact expressly allocates entitlement to water by State line. It says that the States may use the water within their boundaries exclusively. But in the section of the Compact which is at issue here, Reach 2, Subbasin 5, the Compact uses a very different and unique language.
