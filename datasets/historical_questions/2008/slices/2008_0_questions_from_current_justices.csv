Where CERCLA does not define a statutory term -- and there's no definition of ""arrange"" -- this Court has long said, for example in United States against Bestfoods, that we look to the ordinary meaning of the language, and the plain meaning, the ordinary meaning, of ""arrange for"" is to make plans or preparations to do something. The ordinary meaning of the word ""for"" is to refer to a purpose or goal. And the ordinary meaning of ""to dispose"" is to discard or to throw away. So--</text>",2008

Mahoney</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to start with section 912 of the Restatement because I think it really helps to demonstrate that the trial court fully understood and properly applied the common-law standards that govern the determination of apportionment in a pollution case. That section provides that when a party bears the burden of proof, they have to establish the extent of harm and the amount of money with, quote, ""as much certainty as the nature of the tort and circumstances permit. "" end quote. At the time that CERCLA was adopted in 1980, common-law courts for more than a century had been using that standard to apportion damages and harm in pollution cases based on essentially rough estimates because the nature of the tort, pollution, and the circumstances don't allow for the kind of precision that we might require in some other settings such as proof of -- of fault, for instance. And the United States -- they say that the district court departed from those common-law standards, but it's telling: They don't cite a single common-law case decided before CERCLA in their entire brief. If you were to look at section 840E of the Restatement, which governs nuisance cases and apportionment -- it's an application of the section 433A standards -- they cite -- the Restatement cites approximately 50 cases. I don't think there's a single one where a court denied apportionment for a nuisance for a harm such as this one that is theoretically capable of apportionment--</text>",2008

The Court found no warrant in any relevant statute or regulation to impose liability on the United States. In particular, the Court concluded that the approval of the royalty rates in the tribe's lease was governed by the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938, or IMLA.

He provided evidence from two private ophthalmologists or optometrists providing very weak causes -- evidence of causation. One said it was not inconceivable that this was the cause of it. He was examined by two VA doctors, who said it was more likely that this was caused by a post-service infection rather than by an explosion while he was in -- while he was in the service. Now, if the case -- if the notice was defective, why does it not make sense to say to your client, show us that you can come up with some medical evidence that shows that this is service-related, something more than a doctor who says it's not inconceivable? Then it makes sense to remand it. But if you can't do it on appeal, what sense does it make to remand it, where the same failure to provide evidence is going to doom his claim?","<speaker>Eric D.

6482,2008.08-214-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr.",What is the pre-Vaughan case that awarded punitive damages -- awarded punitive damages in a maintenance and cure case?,"<speaker>Gj Rod Sullivan Jr.</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: I would like to start by answering the question that was raised by Justice Ginsburg. This Court does not need to reach the question of whether or not punitive damages are available under the Jones Act or under the FELA in order to decide this issue, because maintenance and cure is different. It precedes the Jones Act by centuries, perhaps even a thousand years, and it deals with a distinctly different problem. Maintenance and cure deals with a situation as what do we do with an injured seaman to get him back to health and get him into the workforce? And the law has provided since Catherine of Aragon went to Greece in the 1200s that the shipowner has a responsibility, in its capacity as a shipowner, to provide that seaman with medical care and to provide that seaman with a living allowance so that he can get better and get back into the work force. Now, in 1920, Senator Jones intended to make the United States Merchant Marine the world's greatest merchant marine. He was dealing in a factual scenario where 12 years earlier, on April 12th of 1912, the Titanic had sunk; 1,900 people had died. Virtually every member of the Senate and Congress knew somebody who was on the Titanic, and during the intervening eight years, certain points of law became obvious. First of all, the people who died on the Titanic could not recover for anything except their lost baggage. They could not recover for the fact that their loved ones had passed away, because there was no cause of action. Secondly, because the Titanic hit an iceberg and was not unseaworthy, there was no cause of action for negligence. So Senator Jones set around to correct these two anomalies in the law, and said what we are going to do is we're going to create a new class of beneficiaries, who are dependents of people who die at sea, and we are going to give them the right to recover pecuniary damages. That's the only place where pecuniary damages are mentioned in the law. And then it said, and as to seamen, we're going to give them an additional right, a cumulative right on top of unseaworthiness, and that's going to be negligence. It never sought out to touch maintenance and cure. Maintenance and cure has been something that's been monitored by the courts ever since its inception, and it is a self-regulating system. Before Guevara, shipowners regularly provided their employees with medical care without asking the question. If there was a close call, they provided the medical care without running to the court. They provided maintenance. Then came Guevara, and Guevara decided for the first time there were no punitive damages, and now you have a growing problem in this country. You have a problem with shipowners providing less and less medical care without resort to the courts. Now, our position here is that a seaman should be not ever have to come before a court to seek maintenance and cure, and the court should never, ever have to award punitive damages.</text>",2008

Let's look at the staleness of the claim. In this particular case, we are talking about maternity leaves that were taken by -- taken by the Respondents between 1968 and 1976. The information that's available to AT&T today is simply whether or not these particular individuals were paid for periods of time. There is nothing more than that. We have no way of knowing whether or not these were maternity leaves or not maternity leaves, whether these were leaves to go to school, leaves to take care of -- of parents, or leaves for any other particular purpose.</text>",2008

Now, the customer has discretion to choose among varying combinations of feedstock and cash in order to complete the transaction for a particular quantity and assay of enriched uranium; but the enricher has its own discretion.

Section 2244(d)( 1)(A) prescribes ""a 1-year period of limitation that shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of the State court. "" ""The limitation period shall run from the latest of. "" --and it identifies four dates, the first of which is ""the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of time for seeking such review.

There's no question that Respondent's statements were voluntary, and the substantial societal costs of allowing him to commit perjury unchecked greatly outweigh any speculative deterrence benefits that would flow from a per se rule of exclusion. The purpose of the right to counsel is to provide an adversary process to ensure the defendant gets a fair trial. And to effectuate that right, the Court has excluded deliberately elicited statements from the government's case-in-chief.

Second, in terms of the effect at trial, there's no basis for distinguishing a voluntary statement obtained in violation of the Massiah rule from Fourth Amendment violations, Miranda violations, or violations of the rule of Michigan v.

First, the Second Circuit ignored section 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act, by which Congress empowered unions to bargain on behalf of their employees over anything germane to the working environment, including methods of workplace dispute resolution. The forum in which an ADEA claim is heard falls squarely in that authority. Indeed, forbidding unions from bargaining about the procedural right to an arbitral forum will carve a judicial exception into the labor law permitting employers to bypass the union and deal directly with their employees, defeating Congress's national labor policy.

Mizer</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Three separate lines of double jeopardy analysis lead independently to the conclusion that the Double Jeopardy Clause commits the Ohio postconviction court to hold a hearing to determine whether Mr. Bies is mentally retarded for purposes of Atkins. First, there has been no acquittal in this case. Second, there is no successive jeopardy; and, third, even if collateral estoppel analysis applies under Ashe versus Swenson, the Atkins issue has not actually and necessarily been decided. Each of these factors shows that the Ohio court's decision to go forward with the Atkins hearing was reasonable, and this Court therefore should, consistent with AEDPA, give the Ohio courts their first chance to adjudicate Mr. Bies's Atkins claim. Much of the dispute in this case centers on the parties' disagreement over the meaning of Ashe versus Swenson and its application. But Mr. Bies cannot benefit from Ashe because Ashe -- the Ashe collateral estoppel rule only operates to benefit defendants who have in hand an earlier acquittal, and Mr. Bies has never been acquitted of the death penalty in any sense of the word. This Court, beginning in Bullington and extending through Sattazahn, has defined an ""acquittal"" in a death penalty context as a finding by the sentencer that the death -- that the sentence of death is warranted in a particular case. And the -- the jury and the trial judge in this case agreed that death was warranted, and, in fact, the Ohio Supreme Court and every reviewing court has agreed that death was warranted.</text>",2008

A central purpose of the contemporaneous objection rule is to ensure that the district court proceedings are as free of error as possible. And that purpose is served in this context, the plea breach context, as it is in others. Rule 52(b) reinforces the contemporaneous objection rule by placing a heavier burden on the party who does not object in the district court to win relief on appeal. The government's submission to the court today is that the plain-error standard does apply to forfeited claims that a plea agreement has been breached, that the Olano framework should be followed, and that one component of the plain-error showing in this context should require a defendant who did not object to a breach in the district court to show a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding was affected by the breach.</text>",2008

Rhodes</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The single issue presented in this case is whether the bar to review under 1447(d) is applicable to a district court's discretionary decision to decline the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction. In this case, after the district court dismissed Respondents' Federal RICO claim, the district court remanded the remaining State law claims under 1367(c). That was not a remand based upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because jurisdiction was specifically conferred upon the court by 1367(a). It's been the rule for some 30 years that the bar of 1447(d) is limited to the specific grounds set forth in 1447(c). And for reference the statutes are on page 2 and 3 of Petitioner's blue brief. Those two grounds are a remand that's based upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction and a remand that is based upon any defect other than a lack of subject matter jurisdiction if it's raised by a timely motion for remand filed within 30 days of the notice of removal. The only prong of 1447(c) that's applicable in this case is whether this remand is one that's based upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Now, Congress clearly conferred jurisdiction on the district courts in 1367(a), where the case contains a Federal claim and related State law claims, and a remand based upon a court's discretion to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is not a remand that's based upon the court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
