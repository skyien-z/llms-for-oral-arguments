3472,1992.91-2024-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas,Would an atheist be allowed to debate a minister from a religious perspective under your rules?,"<speaker>John W. Hoefling</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: It's the position of the respondent in this case, the Center Moriches School District and the president of the board, that they have denied access to the petitioners in this case based upon a well tailored State statute, the New York State Education Law, section 414, and a series of regulations promulgated under that statute. We submit that the school district has essentially established a limited public forum, and it not an open public forum, in which certain uses are not permitted. And we further submit that we have... in the course of using this facility and making it available to certain groups within the community, have been consistent in the uses that we have permitted. We submit that the petitioner is erroneous... has taken an erroneous position in looking at this particular film series as being part of a larger picture, namely the use of the facility for social, educational, and community welfare activities. In fact, if you... if you look at the record, both in the district court from the testimony of Pastor Steigerwald and the submission of Pastor Steigerwald in his third application for the use of the premises, in both of those instances he's indicated that he is not prepared to abide by the regulation of the district, and, in fact, he intends to use the facility for educational institution after... for educational... religious education after hours in the school setting.</text>",1992

Mezibov</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this case the City of Cincinnati seeks to enforce against Harmon and Discovery's publications an outright ban on the distribution in public areas of important and valuable information concerning economic and educational opportunities as part of a regulatory scheme which on its face allows city officials to make unprincipled and standardless decisions about what kinds of speech and what speakers can be on the public areas.</text>",1992
27347,1992.91-1306-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas,"General Starr, would we analyze this differently if there had been a consent to the alternate jurors?","<speaker>Kenneth W. Starr</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case brings before the Court a single question, whether allowing alternate jurors to be present during jury deliberations in violation of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure constitutes automatic reversible error under the plain error rule. The background of the case and the pertinent events at trial we think are important and can be very briefly described. The case arises out of an elaborate financial fraud scheme culminating in a 3-month trial in the Western District of Washington before now Chief Judge Barbara Rothstein. Toward the conclusion of this trial the district judge suggested to the prosecutor and the defense council that two alternate jurors, who were to be designed as such at the close of trial, be allowed to remain with the jury.</text>",1992
27348,1992.91-1160-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas,"Didn't the trial judge or the sentencing judge also find that even though the victim provoked the altercation, he went on to find that with the victim's attack as an excuse the defendant's murder then took on the many, took on many aspects of an assassination?","<speaker>Lynn E. Thomas</speaker><text>Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is before the Court on a petition by the warden of the Idaho maximum security institution for a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Idaho has in its statutory death sentencing scheme a provision that the death penalty is authorized if it is proven by the state that the murder was committed with utter disregard for human life. The Ninth Circuit court of appeals has held that this provision is unconstitutionally vague and that the limiting construction imposed on it by the Supreme Court of Idaho is likewise deficient. That construction, the Idaho Supreme Court's construction, is to the effect that the utter disregard factor is to be limited by inquiring into whether the killing was committed with utmost callous disregard for human life, that is to say whether the killer was a cold-blooded, pitiless slayer.</text>",1992
30104,1992.91-261-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas,But why can't a state make a judgment that this is a long-term project and we don't want this project disrupted?,"<speaker>Charles Fried</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is a case of implied preemption. The court of appeals held that a public owner developing its property may not support a agreement between its construction manager and a council of local unions, an agreement of the sort specifically authorized by sections 8(e) and 8(f) of the National Labor Relations Act. The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, one of the petitioners here, is under Federal court order to complete a massive and complicated construction project. The Authority, as any public or private owner with a similar task, has engaged the services of a construction industry specialist, here Kaiser Engineering, another of the petitioners, to schedule and plan the tasks to be performed, to supervise the contractors performing those tasks, and to establish a labor relations regime for the project. Accordingly, Kaiser did propose to the Authority that the labor relations regime here should be one which is quite common on such projects, a project labor agreement, which is an agreement with all of the unions that usually supply crafts to such a project in return for exclusive representational rights for all workers on the projects irrespective of their contracting and subcontracting relations. The contractors and eventually the owner of the project get the benefit of stable costs, stable labor costs throughout the life of the project, and security against the kinds of labor disruptions that are caused by lawful labor activity. Kaiser proposed such an arrangement to the Authority, which approved the proposal, and accordingly Kaiser negotiated and signed the agreement with the unions here.</text>",1992
30869,1992.92-515-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas,"Let's assume that five were told to attack a white person and five said they would attack a black person, for whatever reasons. Now, the first five of course would be covered by the statute. Would the second five not be covered?","<speaker>James E. Doyle</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Wisconsin penalty enhancement statute quite simply does not punish thought and it does not punish the expression of any idea or belief. It punishes criminal conduct. Mr. Mitchell was and is free to think any thought he wants to think. He was and is free to express that thought in any legitimate manner. But when he violates the Wisconsin criminal code he subjects himself to the punishment of the State of Wisconsin, and it is perfectly appropriate for the State of Wisconsin through its legislature and courts to consider his reason for committing the crime in determining what the appropriate sentence should be. On the face of this statute there is no reason to suggest that Wisconsin is involved in some sinister motive to control thought. The statute is in our brief at page 3, and we believe that it quite clearly serves two very legitimate state interests. It punishes criminal conduct and assesses the appropriate penalty range for a particular type of crime, and it addresses the harmful effects of discriminatory conduct. Nobody suggests that Wisconsin's interest in dealing with the harmful effects of discriminatory criminal conduct are not substantial. 45 other states in this country have adopted laws of some sort attempting to deal with this problem.</text>",1992

36176,1992.91-1030-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","No. No, I don't. I think the key distinction that the respondent has suggested between the exclusionary rule under the Fourth Amendment and Miranda's exclusionary rule is that the exclusionary rule doesn't prevent a constitutional violation from occurring. That's complete upon the illegal search and seizure. Miranda, on the other hand, respondent argues, prevents a constitutional violation from even occurring, and is therefore worth pursuing even on habeas corpus. That, I think, begs the question. It assumes there's a Fifth Amendment violation to be deterred, to be prevented. As this Court has explained, a violation of Miranda is not the same as a violation of the Fifth Amendment, and once that's understood, the distinction cuts the other way. The exclusionary rule, after all, prevents the State from taking advantage of a constitutional violation in every case in which it applies. Miranda sweeps more broadly than the Constitution, so we think the rule of Stone v. Powell should apply a fortiori, and with respect to the significance, the practical impact, it's noteworthy I think that 36 State Attorneys General have filed an amicus brief in this case suggesting that they regard the impact as significant in terms of the respect accorded by the Federal system to the finality of State court judgments. Now, turning to the voluntariness question in this case, the statements that were made after the Miranda warnings were given and waived, the totality of the circumstances shows this: we had a lucid individual not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, not too young to be susceptible to police influence, a veteran of police procedures... he knew the jargon. He testified that he had six prior B&E's. Police taped the interview, not something they're likely to do if they're embarked on a campaign to overbear his will, and of course, as noted, Miranda warnings had been given. Now, in that circumstance, what is it that makes respondent's statements involuntary in response to this promise of leniency? Not that... it was but-for cause. Brady tells us that that's not enough. Not that it was a promise of leniency. Fulminante made clear that statements in Bram suggesting that was enough were no longer good law. Not that there was any possibility that this would generate a false admission of guilt. This isn't a case, you know, confess and we'll release your spouse or your child. In fact, the only condition he had to meet was to tell the truth. Nor is there anything improper about the inducement that was offered in this case. It wasn't, as in Fulminante, talk and we'll save you from a beating.","<speaker>Jeffrey Caminsky</speaker><text>For the last seven or eight hundred years, the writ of habeas corpus has been one of the Crown Jewels in Anglo-American jurisprudence, providing a measure of protection for all who share the heritage of the English common law from tyranny and oppression. In this case, I submit to the Court that we have in front of us today a classic example of the extent to which habeas corpus has strayed from its original and intended purposes and gives us a paradigm of a Federal district court employing a writ of habeas corpus as a writ of Federal error. If we take a look at the record of this case, we see that before his arraignment respondent made three separate statements to the police, the first statement being severable into two separate parts, a pre-Miranda segment and a post-Miranda segment. Prior to trial, the respondent moved to suppress all three statements on various grounds relating to the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, and actually prevailed concerning two of those statements. The only statement that the State trial judge admitted into evidence was the first statement rejecting the respondent's claim that it was obtained unlawfully and in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. In a State court appeal, the respondent chose to appeal on matters relating to this particular statement only on grounds related to the Miranda issue. The State Court of Appeals in Michigan denied his appeal and issued an opinion affirming his conviction. The respondent then filed an application to the Michigan Supreme Court which denied review and ultimately filed a petition for writ of certiorari to this Court which was denied back in 1989. Respondent then went to Federal district court, filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus. Again, as far as this particular statement is concerned, respondent raised only the Miranda issue. In her opinion granting the writ, however, the Federal district judge not only sustained his Miranda claim, in effect overruling the finding of the State court that the police had done nothing wrong, but also went on to find the second half of that statement, the post-Miranda statement, and actually both of the other statements that had been suppressed in the State trial court, to be involuntary. We appealed to the Sixth Circuit, and while finding parts of the district court's opinion slightly inexplicable, the court nevertheless issued an opinion affirming, and that is what brings us here today.</text>",1992
