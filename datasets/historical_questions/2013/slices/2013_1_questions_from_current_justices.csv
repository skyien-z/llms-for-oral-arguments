The correct question is whether the record contains evidence that Toca did not do those things. And that record silence is dispositive in favor of the State on habeas review. Now, if we could pull the curtain back and see what really happened here, it may be the case that Toca gave the proper advice, that he advised Titlow about all the perils of going to trial, and that Titlow continued to maintain her innocence.

So instead of just looking to all the houses of worship within the town, it identifies places of worship that may be outside the town boundaries that people within the town who adhere to a minority religion may attend. And it makes it clear that it's open to chaplains of any religious -- of any religion on a rotating basis. And then they have -- they structure their proceedings so that you have the prayer, and then the legislative part of the town meeting. And then there's a clear separation in time and access between that part of the proceeding and the hearing where variances and things of that nature are held. Now, you would still say that's unconstitutional because you have to add on that a prayer that is acceptable to everybody; is that it?

Stewart</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In promulgating the Transport Rule, EPA sought to protect the public health and to strike a fair balance between the competing interests of upwind and downwind States. EPA's analysis proceeded in three basic steps. First, EPA performed a screening analysis to determine which upwind States would be covered by the Transport Rule. And in order to do that, EPA first identified the downwind receptors that were in a state of nonattainment or had maintenance difficulties, and then it determined which upwind States were linked to those receptors. And in order to be linked to a downwind receptor, the upwind State had -- had to contribute 1 percent or more of the relevant National Air Quality -- Ambient Air Quality standard, or -- or NAAQS, to that downwind receptor. And any State that didn't contribute at least 1 percent to any of the downwind -- any of the relevant downwind receptors was determined not to contribute significantly to nonattainment at that area. Second, once the States that were to be covered by the Transport Rule had been identified, EPA set a State emissions budget for each State. And to do that, it performed computer modeling to determine, in addition to whatever emission control efforts were already going on, what additional emission reductions could be achieved by implementation of control measures available at various cost thresholds; and the thresholds ultimately selected were for NAAQS, $500 per ton. For SO2, the group 1 States were at a level of $2,300 per ton. The group 2 States were 5 -- $500 per ton.

Perry</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: That path between Scylla and Charybdis was charted in Bilski and Mayo. Bilski holds that a fundamental economic principle is an abstract idea and Mayo holds that running such a principle on a computer is, quote, ""not a patentable application of that principle. "" Those two propositions are sufficient to dispose of this case. If Bilski and Mayo stand, Alice's patents fail. Therefore, Mr. Phillips and his friends are asking this Court to change the standard, even though this Court has had three unanimous decisions in the last four terms establishing what the Court called a myriad, a well-established standard. On the abstract idea, Justice Ginsburg, you asked Mr. Phillips what's the difference between hedging and this claim. There is no difference. This is hedging. It is hedging against credit default rather than price fluctuation, but it is simply hedging. And Mr. Phillips stood up for 26 minutes and never once referred to the patent. Let's look at what the inventor, the so-called inventor said about this invention. This is at JA 293 to 94 in the specification. This claim has simply two steps. It's very simple.

In fact, I would recommend that the Court turn to the back page of the government's brief where the statute is actually set forth. And we can see that provision (h)(3) consists of one sentence, and that sentence consists of two parts separated by a comma.

Now, importantly, the government does not contend that there is any ambiguity in the language before the comma. Everyone agrees that it contemplates and includes all derivative beneficiaries. There's no dispute about that. And a bedrock rule at the Step 1 inquiry is that the Court reads the statute as a harmonious whole. That goes double when we're talking about a single sentence. So if there is a possible reading of this sentence that is harmonious with the clear opening clause that applies to all derivative beneficiaries under Step 1 of Chevron, that is the reading the Court gives to the statute. It's especially important here because the precise question at issue in this case is a question of eligibility and scope.

It's especially important here because the precise question at issue in this case is a question of eligibility and scope. Who gets the benefit of the two benefits set forth, the two duties set forth by the shalls in the language after the comma. And Congress spoke to that directly in the language before the comma. All derivative beneficiaries who have gone through the (h)(1) formula and whose age is determined to be over 21. Now, the government's claim of ambiguity here depends on asking the Court to read one of the benefits after the comma, automatic conversion, in such a narrow and limited way, a way not required by the plain language, a way that even the BIA actually did not adopt, but such that it is incompatible with the broad scope set forth before the comma. The Court should be very suspicious of that reading, because it is exactly the contrary of the traditional tool of statutory construction going back to Brown & Williamson and FTC v. Mandel that says the Court reads a statute holistically as a harmonious whole. For the government's argument to work, the Court would have to be satisfied that we were in a situation like National Association of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, which is the only case that they cite for their ambiguity claim, but there the court faced two different statutes and acted at different times that were clearly contradictory.

Fleming</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government began at Step 2 of Chevron, but I would submit that this case can and should be resolved at Step 1. The government is asking this Court to read the statute in a highly disfavored way such that it is not harmonious but at war with itself, and nothing in the language requires that. In fact, I would recommend that the Court turn to the back page of the government's brief where the statute is actually set forth. And we can see that provision (h)(3) consists of one sentence, and that sentence consists of two parts separated by a comma. Before the comma, the language sets forth one and only one eligibility criterion. After the comma, the language sets forth two things that shall be done if the eligibility criterion is satisfied. Now, importantly, the government does not contend that there is any ambiguity in the language before the comma. Everyone agrees that it contemplates and includes all derivative beneficiaries. There's no dispute about that. And a bedrock rule at the Step 1 inquiry is that the Court reads the statute as a harmonious whole. That goes double when we're talking about a single sentence.

And that's where I'm having a little bit of difficulty, because it's not that you have to use this name, you're permitted to use this name under their regulations. But why are you permitted to use it in a misleading way? That's really the -- I think the government's position, which is, if you're using the name in combination with other factors in a misleading way that's not a subject to the regulation, just the name, then it's actionable under the Lanham Act.","<speaker>Seth P. Waxman</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Lanham Act provides a remedy for businesses whose market is misappropriated by competitors that misrepresent the character of the goods they sell. This case presents an egregious violation of the law. Coca-Cola's label grossly misleads customers, as Coke anticipated, but Coke says that it need not answer under the Lanham Act because its label is authorized by FDA regulations. The label is not, in fact, authorized for reasons we explain and with which the United States largely agrees, but even if it were consistent with FDA regulations that would not strip POM of its right to prove a willful Lanham Act violation.

37043,2013.12-761-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Sullivan, can I ask -- if this gets you away from the argument you want to make, I apologize for that. But suppose we thought that the preemption provision here was utterly irrelevant, that it applies to state law and not Federal law, and that you can't go around broadening the statute just because the purposes behind that statute might be thought to apply to something else. So suppose I just put that aside. Do you still have any kind of argument?","<speaker>Seth P.

37044,2013.12-761-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"Wyeth, the FDA actually approves, looks at the label and says, this one is okay. Not only is it not misleading, but it complies with all health requirements, and because the producers of drugs have the ability to change the label without FDA approval, there was -- we found no preemptions and no impossibility. How is Wyeth any different? The FDA here -- it's even worse, this case. The FDA doesn't approve the labels. It never looks at them and says they are okay or not okay unless they decide to enforce the statute. How is this better than Wyeth?","<speaker>Seth P.

37046,2013.12-761-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan,"But, Mr. Waxman, I think Ms. Sherry said that the FDA views itself as having a job beyond health and safety, that they view themselves as least -- not thinking about competitors' welfare or lack thereof, but at least thinking about consumer understanding of labels. So if that's the case, is the determination under the Lanham Act different from the determination under the FDCA?","<speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I could start with the naming aspect of the case. Justice Kagan, you are exactly right. We have a circumstance here where we have two Federal statutes that cover the same subject matter that apply functionally the same standard to the same words on the same product label. Under the FDCA, we have an authoritative interpretation of that language by the FDA. 102.33 is a regulation that was reached after extensive rule-making proceedings over the course of 25 years. The FDA considered the exact same question that is being raised here. It looked to figure out what an appropriate common or unusual name was for a juice blend that had a small amount of a highly flavorful and expensive juice in order to allow consumers to know -- in order to prevent consumers from being misled as to the juice content of that particular product.</text>",2013
