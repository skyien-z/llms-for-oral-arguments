Massachusetts asked this Court to uphold that statute under the time, place, and manner test, but the law fails each aspect of that test. I would like to begin with narrow tailoring. The State says the law is necessary to protect its interests in preventing obstruction and congestion. But the law is not narrowly tailored to those interests for three reasons: First, the law applies regardless of whether there's any threat of obstruction or congestion at all, even when the sidewalks are entirely open and empty. For example, Mrs. McCullen generally does her counseling early in the morning on Tuesdays and Wednesdays beginning at 7:00 o'clock in the morning. She testified that she is sometimes alone when she does this counseling. Nancy Clark testified that 90 percent of the time that she is at the clinic in Worcester, she is all alone. A statute that makes it illegal for Mrs. McCullen or Mrs. Clark to engage in peaceful, consensual conversation on a public sidewalk for fear of obstruction and congestion is not narrowly tailored.</text>",2013

1663,2013.12-820-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Excuse me. Let me give you this example. Suppose a child is abducted at -- at age one and is concealed for 10 years and then the location of the child is discovered. The other parent files a petition. So that if there's equitable tolling, the petition was filed within one year. But during those 10 years, the child has become very well settled in the new country, has learned the language of that country, the customs developed, gone to school, developed relationships, and so forth. Under -- if there is no equitable tolling but the abduction can be taken into account under the doctrine of equitable discretion, that's -- that's one thing. But the way you read this, the way you read the Convention, the equitable tolling would mean that the petition was filed within a year, and unless one of the conditions in Article 13 was met, for example a grave risk that the child's return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation, then there would be -- then the child would have to be removed.

And if you have a rule that says if can abduct the child and you can hide for a year, which isn't very difficult, then all you have to do is provide some evidence of settlement, and you are going to -- you are going to win, you are going to deter return.

With respect to winning or losing the case, you're going to get de novo review because the Federal Circuit here looked at the claim construction, under de novo review, agreed with the District Court that it had construed the claim properly and that you lost. So you got de novo review. The issue on a reasonable ground to pursue the litigation, whether it was objectively reasonable or not, I think that's Justice Breyer's point, which it generally has factors that are independent of winning or losing, and that's why I kept going back to what the District Court said in this case, which you seem to ignore. It, at one point, recognizes that your claim was a difficult one, but it says that doesn't excuse the fact that you maintained the 52C claim, the one at issue here, even after both the master -- special master and your expert had said a particular claim wasn't sustainable. And it continued with a long example of behavior examples, multiple ones, that it found unreasonable, having nothing to do with the ultimate reasonableness of your last argument before the Appellate Court. So, again, I ask the question: Why should this objective reasonableness be considered a pure question of law?

The second point of agreement is that greenhouse gases cannot be treated the same as other air pollutants for purposes of the PSD and Title 5 programs, because the unambiguous statutory requirements of those programs are incompatible with sensible regulation of greenhouse gases. EPA thinks it can fix this problem by imposing an atextual agency-created regime that applies only to greenhouse gases. The proper response, however, is for EPA to conclude that Congress never delegated regulatory authority over greenhouse gases in the PSD and Title 5 programs.

Any other interpretation would raise grave First Amendment issues. As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, this case is indistinguishable from this Court's prior holding in Flower v. United States. Flower involved a street that was on a military base. It involved an individual, John Flower, who was subjected to a bar order--</text>",2013

Jones</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As some of this questioning indicated, if any party has standing under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, it's a party whose goods are misrepresented in false advertising. To remove any doubt about that question, Congress amended the statute in 1988 to ensure a cause of action when a false advertiser misrepresents the goods or commercial services of, quote, ‶ another person ″, end quote. This Court's zone of interest analysis shows that parties whose goods are disparaged, either expressly or by necessary implication, must have standing to sue. Lexmark's simply wrong about the idea that the zone of interest analysis in the Lanham Act does not impose limits upon who may sue.

But if I may begin, please, I'd like to address Justice Scalia's point about where's the ambiguity in the statute. And unfortunately, my friend and I disagree, because I think the statute under 157(b)(1) is unambiguous in my favor. So if I could take you back to the statute, and I'll use the Solicitor General's brief for convenience. 157(b)(1) is the provision by which district courts, if they want to -- there's no compulsion on these Article 3 officers -- if they want to, they can refer matters to bankruptcy judges. And it says, when there is a matter referred, that they may hear and determine the matter and may enter an order or judgment. My interpretation, I believe, is the more natural one of ""may enter an order of judgment. "" it's a permissive grant of authority. There's no compulsion to enter an order and judgment. They can simply hear and determine the matter and not enter an order and judgment. And I can contrast this textual language -- you don't have to go very far -- down in (c)(1) and (c)(2), where (c)(2), there was only one “ may ”, they don't have the double “ may permissive grant of authority ”. And there's -- and in the noncore matters, there's a -- a “ it shall ”, when “ it shall determine ”. They use the verb “ shall ” in (c)(2). So I think that (b)(1) with two uses of “ may ” is very clear that when a matter is referred under (b)(1), they may enter an order of judgment, but don't have to enter an order of judgment. And I think this gets us around his difficulty--</text>",2013

Therefore, the petitioners were not given fair warning that the use of force in this case, if it was prohibited, was prohibited, and they retain immunity, and the Sixth Circuit must be reversed.

So if we only focus on the clearly established upon case after case after case, we don't make much progress in actually telling police officers where the line is. So how do we do that? Why shouldn't we do it here? When should we do it?","<speaker>John F. Bash</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think the correct disposition of this case follows from two propositions: One, there is some level of reckless driving in response to a police pursuit that authorizes the use of deadly force, some level, at a -- in a high-speed chase. Second, it was not beyond debate in 2004 in the relevant circuits here that the driving that the undisputed facts show in this case would have authorized deadly force. It might have been wrong as a matter of the Fourth Amendment, but it was not clearly established. Respondents have not pointed to a single circuit case that would have given officers clear notice that the undisputed conduct here would not authorize the use of deadly force.</text>",2013
