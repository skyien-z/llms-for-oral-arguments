Massachusetts asked this Court to uphold that statute under the time, place, and manner test, but the law fails each aspect of that test. I would like to begin with narrow tailoring. The State says the law is necessary to protect its interests in preventing obstruction and congestion. But the law is not narrowly tailored to those interests for three reasons: First, the law applies regardless of whether there's any threat of obstruction or congestion at all, even when the sidewalks are entirely open and empty. For example, Mrs. McCullen generally does her counseling early in the morning on Tuesdays and Wednesdays beginning at 7:00 o'clock in the morning. She testified that she is sometimes alone when she does this counseling. Nancy Clark testified that 90 percent of the time that she is at the clinic in Worcester, she is all alone. A statute that makes it illegal for Mrs. McCullen or Mrs. Clark to engage in peaceful, consensual conversation on a public sidewalk for fear of obstruction and congestion is not narrowly tailored.</text>",2013

1663,2013.12-820-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Excuse me. Let me give you this example. Suppose a child is abducted at -- at age one and is concealed for 10 years and then the location of the child is discovered. The other parent files a petition. So that if there's equitable tolling, the petition was filed within one year. But during those 10 years, the child has become very well settled in the new country, has learned the language of that country, the customs developed, gone to school, developed relationships, and so forth. Under -- if there is no equitable tolling but the abduction can be taken into account under the doctrine of equitable discretion, that's -- that's one thing. But the way you read this, the way you read the Convention, the equitable tolling would mean that the petition was filed within a year, and unless one of the conditions in Article 13 was met, for example a grave risk that the child's return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation, then there would be -- then the child would have to be removed.

And if you have a rule that says if can abduct the child and you can hide for a year, which isn't very difficult, then all you have to do is provide some evidence of settlement, and you are going to -- you are going to win, you are going to deter return.

With respect to winning or losing the case, you're going to get de novo review because the Federal Circuit here looked at the claim construction, under de novo review, agreed with the District Court that it had construed the claim properly and that you lost. So you got de novo review. The issue on a reasonable ground to pursue the litigation, whether it was objectively reasonable or not, I think that's Justice Breyer's point, which it generally has factors that are independent of winning or losing, and that's why I kept going back to what the District Court said in this case, which you seem to ignore. It, at one point, recognizes that your claim was a difficult one, but it says that doesn't excuse the fact that you maintained the 52C claim, the one at issue here, even after both the master -- special master and your expert had said a particular claim wasn't sustainable. And it continued with a long example of behavior examples, multiple ones, that it found unreasonable, having nothing to do with the ultimate reasonableness of your last argument before the Appellate Court. So, again, I ask the question: Why should this objective reasonableness be considered a pure question of law?

The second point of agreement is that greenhouse gases cannot be treated the same as other air pollutants for purposes of the PSD and Title 5 programs, because the unambiguous statutory requirements of those programs are incompatible with sensible regulation of greenhouse gases. EPA thinks it can fix this problem by imposing an atextual agency-created regime that applies only to greenhouse gases. The proper response, however, is for EPA to conclude that Congress never delegated regulatory authority over greenhouse gases in the PSD and Title 5 programs.

Any other interpretation would raise grave First Amendment issues. As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, this case is indistinguishable from this Court's prior holding in Flower v. United States. Flower involved a street that was on a military base. It involved an individual, John Flower, who was subjected to a bar order--</text>",2013

Jones</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As some of this questioning indicated, if any party has standing under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, it's a party whose goods are misrepresented in false advertising. To remove any doubt about that question, Congress amended the statute in 1988 to ensure a cause of action when a false advertiser misrepresents the goods or commercial services of, quote, ‶ another person ″, end quote. This Court's zone of interest analysis shows that parties whose goods are disparaged, either expressly or by necessary implication, must have standing to sue. Lexmark's simply wrong about the idea that the zone of interest analysis in the Lanham Act does not impose limits upon who may sue.

But if I may begin, please, I'd like to address Justice Scalia's point about where's the ambiguity in the statute. And unfortunately, my friend and I disagree, because I think the statute under 157(b)(1) is unambiguous in my favor. So if I could take you back to the statute, and I'll use the Solicitor General's brief for convenience. 157(b)(1) is the provision by which district courts, if they want to -- there's no compulsion on these Article 3 officers -- if they want to, they can refer matters to bankruptcy judges. And it says, when there is a matter referred, that they may hear and determine the matter and may enter an order or judgment. My interpretation, I believe, is the more natural one of ""may enter an order of judgment. "" it's a permissive grant of authority. There's no compulsion to enter an order and judgment. They can simply hear and determine the matter and not enter an order and judgment. And I can contrast this textual language -- you don't have to go very far -- down in (c)(1) and (c)(2), where (c)(2), there was only one “ may ”, they don't have the double “ may permissive grant of authority ”. And there's -- and in the noncore matters, there's a -- a “ it shall ”, when “ it shall determine ”. They use the verb “ shall ” in (c)(2). So I think that (b)(1) with two uses of “ may ” is very clear that when a matter is referred under (b)(1), they may enter an order of judgment, but don't have to enter an order of judgment. And I think this gets us around his difficulty--</text>",2013

Therefore, the petitioners were not given fair warning that the use of force in this case, if it was prohibited, was prohibited, and they retain immunity, and the Sixth Circuit must be reversed.

And that means that when we approach the government, when we petition the government, we do so not as a Christian, not as a Jew, not as a Muslim, not as a nonbeliever, only as an American. And what troubles me about this case is that here a citizen is going to a local community board, supposed to be the closest, the most responsive institution of government that exists, and is immediately being asked, being forced to identify whether she believes in the things that most of the people in the room believe in, whether she belongs to the same religious idiom as most of the people in the room do. And it strikes me that that might be inconsistent with this understanding that when we relate to our government, we all do so as Americans, and not as Jews and not as Christians and not as nonbelievers.","<speaker>Ian H. Gershengorn</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Second Circuit's decision here requires courts to determine when a legislature has permitted too many sectarian references in its prayers or has invited too many Christian prayer-givers. That approach is flawed for two reasons. First, it cannot be squared with our nation's long history of opening legislative sessions not only with a prayer, but a prayer given in the prayer-giver's own religion idiom. And second, it invites exactly the sort of parsing of prayer that Marsh sought to avoid and that Federal courts are ill-equipped to handle.</text>",2013

So instead of just looking to all the houses of worship within the town, it identifies places of worship that may be outside the town boundaries that people within the town who adhere to a minority religion may attend. And it makes it clear that it's open to chaplains of any religious -- of any religion on a rotating basis. And then they have -- they structure their proceedings so that you have the prayer, and then the legislative part of the town meeting.

The first question is whether a claim for additional benefits under a frequent flyer program, like flight upgrades, relate to prices, routes and services. This Court answered that question in the affirmative in Wolens and, indeed, underscored the questions not particularly close. The Ninth Circuit's ability to reach the contrary conclusion in the precise same context underscores how far they have strayed from this Court's precedence. The second question is whether the Plaintiffs' claim here seek merely to enforce the parties' voluntary undertakings or, rather, seek to enforce State law to enlarge those undertakings and enlarge the parties' bargain. And it's to that question 2 we think Respondent's own claims here make the case quite clear. Respondent did bring a claim here to enforce the parties' voluntary undertakings, a breach of contract claim and lost on the merits. The implied preemption claim is different.

And in order to do that, EPA first identified the downwind receptors that were in a state of nonattainment or had maintenance difficulties, and then it determined which upwind States were linked to those receptors. And in order to be linked to a downwind receptor, the upwind State had -- had to contribute 1 percent or more of the relevant National Air Quality -- Ambient Air Quality standard, or -- or NAAQS, to that downwind receptor. And any State that didn't contribute at least 1 percent to any of the downwind -- any of the relevant downwind receptors was determined not to contribute significantly to nonattainment at that area. Second, once the States that were to be covered by the Transport Rule had been identified, EPA set a State emissions budget for each State. And to do that, it performed computer modeling to determine, in addition to whatever emission control efforts were already going on, what additional emission reductions could be achieved by implementation of control measures available at various cost thresholds; and the thresholds ultimately selected were for NAAQS, $500 per ton. For SO2, the group 1 States were at a level of $2,300 per ton. The group 2 States were 5 -- $500 per ton.

Following up on Justice Scalia about the statutory language and how you read it, I think, you know, most people, everybody, thinks that it's better to regulate with attention to costs than to regulate without attention to costs. We have this, our Trucking Association decision where we said, well, notwithstanding that everybody agrees that regulating with attention to costs is better, when Congress says the opposite we have to go with the opposite. And there we said Congress had said the opposite because it had talked about protecting the public health with an adequate margin of safety. Now, I'm wondering, what does it take in a statute to make us say, look, Congress has demanded that the regulation here occur without any attention to costs?

The First Circuit's decision interpreting 1514A to permit a contractor to retaliate against its own employees is inconsistent with its general usage and it leads to four implausible consequences. First, it renders the statutory language regarding contractors virtually meaningless. Secondly, it renders that language with regard to contractors in the mutual fund industry literally meaningless. Third, it has the implausible consequence of permitting the very type of retaliation that we know Congress was concerned about. Retaliation by an accountant such as Arthur Andersen. And finally, it renders incoherent the provisions in 1514A and the related remedial provision regarding scienter, the burden of proof and an affirmative defense.</text>",2013

And the experts say: Really can't say whether the heroin caused the death in the sense that if the -- if he hadn't taken the heroin, he wouldn't have died. So they say: Well, what can you say? He said: Well, what I can say is that if he hadn't -- is that the heroin made it more likely that he died. Well, how much more likely did the heroin make it?

We give an example in our brief: If the person actually gives the gun so it meets the actus reus requirement that Mr. Elwood has proposed, he actually gives the gun to somebody, not because he cares if that person commits the crime, which he knows he intends to commit, but as a favor for his friend--</text>",2013

Fleming</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government began at Step 2 of Chevron, but I would submit that this case can and should be resolved at Step 1. The government is asking this Court to read the statute in a highly disfavored way such that it is not harmonious but at war with itself, and nothing in the language requires that. In fact, I would recommend that the Court turn to the back page of the government's brief where the statute is actually set forth. And we can see that provision (h)(3) consists of one sentence, and that sentence consists of two parts separated by a comma. Before the comma, the language sets forth one and only one eligibility criterion. After the comma, the language sets forth two things that shall be done if the eligibility criterion is satisfied. Now, importantly, the government does not contend that there is any ambiguity in the language before the comma. Everyone agrees that it contemplates and includes all derivative beneficiaries. There's no dispute about that. And a bedrock rule at the Step 1 inquiry is that the Court reads the statute as a harmonious whole. That goes double when we're talking about a single sentence. So if there is a possible reading of this sentence that is harmonious with the clear opening clause that applies to all derivative beneficiaries under Step 1 of Chevron, that is the reading the Court gives to the statute. It's especially important here because the precise question at issue in this case is a question of eligibility and scope. Who gets the benefit of the two benefits set forth, the two duties set forth by the shalls in the language after the comma. And Congress spoke to that directly in the language before the comma. All derivative beneficiaries who have gone through the (h)(1) formula and whose age is determined to be over 21. Now, the government's claim of ambiguity here depends on asking the Court to read one of the benefits after the comma, automatic conversion, in such a narrow and limited way, a way not required by the plain language, a way that even the BIA actually did not adopt, but such that it is incompatible with the broad scope set forth before the comma. The Court should be very suspicious of that reading, because it is exactly the contrary of the traditional tool of statutory construction going back to Brown & Williamson and FTC v. Mandel that says the Court reads a statute holistically as a harmonious whole. For the government's argument to work, the Court would have to be satisfied that we were in a situation like National Association of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, which is the only case that they cite for their ambiguity claim, but there the court faced two different statutes and acted at different times that were clearly contradictory.

Fleming</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government began at Step 2 of Chevron, but I would submit that this case can and should be resolved at Step 1. The government is asking this Court to read the statute in a highly disfavored way such that it is not harmonious but at war with itself, and nothing in the language requires that. In fact, I would recommend that the Court turn to the back page of the government's brief where the statute is actually set forth. And we can see that provision (h)(3) consists of one sentence, and that sentence consists of two parts separated by a comma. Before the comma, the language sets forth one and only one eligibility criterion. After the comma, the language sets forth two things that shall be done if the eligibility criterion is satisfied. Now, importantly, the government does not contend that there is any ambiguity in the language before the comma. Everyone agrees that it contemplates and includes all derivative beneficiaries. There's no dispute about that. And a bedrock rule at the Step 1 inquiry is that the Court reads the statute as a harmonious whole. That goes double when we're talking about a single sentence. So if there is a possible reading of this sentence that is harmonious with the clear opening clause that applies to all derivative beneficiaries under Step 1 of Chevron, that is the reading the Court gives to the statute. It's especially important here because the precise question at issue in this case is a question of eligibility and scope. Who gets the benefit of the two benefits set forth, the two duties set forth by the shalls in the language after the comma. And Congress spoke to that directly in the language before the comma. All derivative beneficiaries who have gone through the (h)(1) formula and whose age is determined to be over 21. Now, the government's claim of ambiguity here depends on asking the Court to read one of the benefits after the comma, automatic conversion, in such a narrow and limited way, a way not required by the plain language, a way that even the BIA actually did not adopt, but such that it is incompatible with the broad scope set forth before the comma. The Court should be very suspicious of that reading, because it is exactly the contrary of the traditional tool of statutory construction going back to Brown & Williamson and FTC v.
