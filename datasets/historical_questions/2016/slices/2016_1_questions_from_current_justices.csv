It was addressed to, you know, someone wrongfully imprisoned for 20 years and the State felt some obligation to remedy that at least in a symbolic way. But in order to qualify for that you do need to show all these other things. And -- I mean, is it completely settled?

26070,2016.15-9260-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor,"-- I mean, the lack of beauty of the guidelines is they're so artificial on so many levels; all right? What differentiates a normal theft from a robbery is the use of force. And the guidelines, in defining the guidelines range for a theft, starts at a much, much lower base level. Starts at a seven, okay? For a robbery, it starts at a base level of 20. Once you start with that huge difference between the use of force and the nonuse of force, obviously, the robbery guideline is always going to include the use of force. The fact that it might be with a gun as opposed to a knife as opposed to a threat of violence or whatever else you want to define it, the use of force is inherent already in the guideline calculation because, otherwise, that -- there's no reason. They could have just had one table and said, if you rob someone, if it was a pure calculation, as you suggest it, without thinking about the gun, it would have been $20,000 is taken, we're all going to start at a offense level of five years and build up from there. That's not what the guidelines do. So when you're taking discretion away from a judge, I think that's one of the reasons we often require specificity, because the guidelines are artificial in so many different ways.

All of the judges below concluded that Plaintiffs' core theory is squarely foreclosed by Iqbal. But the Second Circuit majority then formulated its own list merger theory of liability, premising liability on the alleged decision of Attorney General Ashcroft to merge the New York list of detainees, which had not been fully vetted, with the INS list, thereby continuing the hold-until-cleared policy for detainees on both lists. Bivens' liability does not attach here for at least three reasons. First, the Bivens remedy should not be extended to national security and immigration policy decisions by senior officials in the wake of the September 11 attacks. If the damages remedy is to be imposed, it's for Congress, not this Court, to do so. Second, the list merger theory suffers from the same pleading deficiencies that this Court identified in Iqbal itself. Among other things, there is an obvious alternative and noninvidious explanation of the list merger decision.

Phillips</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think because this is largely an international trade case, it's probably useful to put this case in context and to compare it to the facts that gave rise to the passage of Section 271(f) that's at issue in this case. You'll recall that in the Deepsouth case, that was a case involving a shrimp deveiner in which all of the activities took place within the United States, except for the final act that took less than an hour to assemble in a foreign country. In that case, this Court held even that was not within the meaning of the -- of the patent statute as it existed then, and Congress then acted to fill that particular loophole. The facts of this case seem to me to be the polar opposite of that. With -- Life Tech has -- Life Technologies operates an -- an enormous plant in England, in the United Kingdom. It spends tens of million dollars on that plant. Four out of the five components that go into the creation of the kits that are at issue in this case are sourced outside of the United States; one inside. I'll come back to that in a minute. And as relevant to this litigation, all of the kit -- kits are sold outside of the United States. So the only contact that any of this has with the United States is the fact that a single, commodity product is shipped to England as part of the process for the fabrication of these particular kits. Now, that commodity product is called a Taq polymerase, which I will readily concede that when I think about what you buy off-the-shelf, I don't go to Costco to buy Taq polymerase, but I'm told, and I think it's absolutely undisputed in the record, that this is a commodity. This is at the essence of what the Congress enacted in (f)(2), which is a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for many non-infringing uses. And, indeed, if you get online and put in ""Taq polymerase,"" you can find literally dozens and dozens of ways to purchase it online at this time. And that was true as much in 2006. It may have been a significant product in 1989, but clearly by 2006, it was a commodity.

And then your adversary's position that the Texas court has already said that under Texas law, you can't serve this way.","<speaker>Elaine J. Goldenberg</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Article 10(a) of the Hague Service Convention permits service through postal channels on persons abroad if the law of the forum State -- that's the State where the case is pending -- authorizes such service and if the receiving State where the mail will be delivered hasn't objected to Article 10(a). And I'd like to start with this permit authorize framework, because I think there's been a lot of confusion in the lower courts on this subject. The question presented here is perhaps phrased a little inartfully in terms of authorization, and it would be really helpful if this Court would clarify this point. Article 10(a) says that provided the State of destination does not object, the present convention shall not interfere with the freedom to send judicial documents by postal channels to persons abroad. So it is not interfering with freedom. It is -- it's not the same thing as providing an affirmative authorization for service by mail. That affirmative authorization has to be found elsewhere. And the place where you find it is in the law of the forum State. So, for instance, in our Federal system, if you look at Rule 4 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, there is a subsection of Rule 4 that says where an international agreement permits, but does not authorize service on persons abroad, here are a bunch of things you can do. And some of those options include service by mail, using registered mail by -- sent by the clerk of the court, service by mail if the district court judge in a particular case directs it, and so on. So that's where you get the authorization. You have to -- the forum State has to authorize the service by mail on a person abroad. At the other end of the process, you have to see whether the receiving State has objected to service by mail. And as my friend indicated, nearly half of the countries that have acceded to or ratified this treaty have indeed objected to service by mail.

Rice</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court: The jury repeatedly deadlocked as to Russell Overton telling the court it would be impossible to reach a verdict and returning a conviction only after multiple assertions of impasse, and 40 to 50 additional votes. In this incredibly close case the government not only wrongfully suppressed evidence of two alternative perpetrators, but also withheld critical impeachment evidence concerning a key witness against Overton Carrie Eleby. The case against Overton was especially weak and Eleby's testimony played an especially important role in that case. I'd like to begin by briefly addressing the weaknesses in the government's case here. At trial the government presented three key witnesses against Overton who placed him in the alley during the attack. The two corroborators, Alston Bennett and Carrie Eleby. All of those witnesses had serious credibility problems and their stories diverged in several significant respects, including among other things about who was involved and what role they supposedly played. At the same time, another purported eye witness who the government later emphasized as the key to its case, affirmatively denied seeing Overton in the alley during the attack even though Overton is exceptionally tall and witness knew him personally.</text>",2016

Gershengorn</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress provided extensive substantive and procedural protections for aliens whom the government wishes to remove, but at the same time, addressed the real concerns about recidivism and flight risk by providing for mandatory detention during removal proceedings for certain categories of criminal aliens and aliens arriving at our shores. The Ninth Circuit undid that legislative balance, invoking principles of constitutional avoidance to require the government to release those aliens unless the government can prove by a preponderance of the evidence every six months that detention remains necessary. The Ninth Circuit's decision is a serious misuse of the constitutional avoidance canon. With respect to arriving aliens, there is no constitutional problem to avoid. As even the Ninth Circuit recognized, the statute is constitutional in the vast majority of applications, and any concerns about outlier cases involving lawful permanent residents can be dressed in as-applied challenges. And with respect to criminal aliens, the text of the statute forecloses the Ninth Circuit's approach, and in any event, the statute is constitutional as written under this Court's decision in Demore. The net result of the Ninth Circuit's one-size-fits-all rule is -- is a regime that's at odds with the text that Congress enacted. It undermines DHS's enforcement priorities, and it creates incentives for individual aliens to delay their removal proceedings.</text>",2016

And why would it not be the case that the -- that the death or injury in such a case is also proximately caused by that violation? In other words, proximate cause says what kind of things are foreseeable, and it says -- it sets an outer bound, and it says totally flukey, random things we're not going to say are proximately caused.
