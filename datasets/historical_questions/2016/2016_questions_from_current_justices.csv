Just to follow up on Justice Sotomayor's point, I think you argued at page 228 of the Joint Appendix that trial counsel's objection was not sufficient to cover the charging error, and I think that the Federal district court on habeas found the same thing on page 366. And so that raises, to my mind, a question whether Martinez applies here. Couldn't -- couldn't your client have brought a Martinez claim? And isn't the Martinez rule premised on the idea you get one clear shot at bringing the issue?

So when you have these -- I'm not talking about this particular case. But in general, when you have the claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, it's sometimes easy in retrospect to say, well, here's an issue that, you know, maybe -- the appellate counsel, in the exercise of discretion, thought it was like number 6 in the order of -- of strength. And you look back and in hindsight you say, well, he should have made more of that, and it's not even mentioned at all in the appellate brief.

Unlike Martinez and unlike Trevino, which were cabined, it -- it seems to me, and you'll correct me if I'm wrong, that if we agree with your position, then anything that -- that an attorney in Federal habeas can examine the trial record, and if that attorney finds anything that seems to be an error, it can be raised in Federal habeas, even if there was no objection at the time of trial, it wasn't raised on direct appeal, it wasn't raised in a State collateral proceeding. That's where this is going. And if it's an -- if the underlying error is ineffective assistance of counsel, well, whatever it is, all of that will be evaluated by the Federal habeas court outside of AEDPA. That's where this is going. So this is an enormous hole. Am I not -- isn't that where this -- isn't that what this means? Because the -- the argument in Federal habeas would be there was cause because counsel was ineffective at the collateral -- State collateral proceeding, and this counsel was ineffective at the State collateral proceeding because there was ineffective assistance on direct appeal. And then counsel on direct appeal was ineffective because there was an error at trial. So the Federal habeas court has to make all of those determinations, and if the court -- the -- which means the court is going to have to look at whether or not there was an error at trial and, in doing that, it is not going to be asking whether a -- whether a State court reasonably rejected the claim because it was never presented to the State court.

So what do we about that problem, number one? And, number two, do we also create an incentive for States to stop using collateral review to test IAC claims? They don't have to do that.

No one is stopping them from advertising themselves that way, or signing contracts that way, or engaging in any activity, except that stopping someone else from using the same trademark. But even that they could do. Because you don't need a registered trademark to sue under the Lanham Act's entitlement for the confusion of the public in the use of any kind of registered or unregistered mark. If another band called themselves Slants, they would be subject to deceptive advertisements because they wouldn't be this Slants. So there is a big difference.

In view of the questions from Justice Breyer and Justice Alito and others on the bench, I think it may be useful to start at the outset to describe what we think the Due Process Rule is in this case and why it does not call into question traditional discretionary sentencing within a broad range that is not informed by sentencing guidelines. So I think the starting point for analysis here is due process. Due process does not itself require that all provisions of law not be vague in some customary dictionary sense. Due process protects fundamental fairness. And when looking at fundamental fairness, the Court examines history and practice. Now, the history of this country has included discretionary sentencing within a range without any guidance to the judge since the 1790 Crimes Act. And through much of the 19th century, many statutes were written that way. The idea that due process vagueness analysis would somehow invalidate that contradicts cases like Medina, which take as their touchstone for due process historical practice. I also think that the purposes of what later was announced as the vagueness doctrine are not implicated in traditional sentencing. The reason for that is not that traditional sentencing produces uniform or predictable results. It does not. It maximizes instead another important value of sentencing, which is individualization or proportionality. Sentencing involves a large array of facts that are very difficult to reduce to rules. The traditional sentencing process relies on the judge and the defendant, in the courtroom with counsel, to examine the multiplicity of facts that bear on appropriate sentencing and then to select a sentence within that range. That is not arbitrary. We have cited in footnote 2 of our reply brief a case from this Court where the Court described that as conscientious judgment rather than arbitrary action. It therefore does not implicate the purpose of the due-process vagueness doctrine. On the other hand, the Sentencing Guidelines as this Court has described them in recent opinions that have examined the advisory system that's been put into place post-Booker, stress that that system injects law into the sentencing process. The judge must calculate the Guidelines range. The judge must be cognizant of it throughout the sentencing process. That Guidelines range informs the judge's selection of a sentence because the judge knows that it reflects the considered expert views of the Sentencing Commission filtered through congressional policy. And because of those features of the sentencing system in the district court, the Court has described the Guidelines range as having an anchoring effect, which tends to influence sentences if intended to do so, and has that effect, and it is continuing to have that effect.

So I think the starting point for analysis here is due process. Due process does not itself require that all provisions of law not be vague in some customary dictionary sense. Due process protects fundamental fairness. And when looking at fundamental fairness, the Court examines history and practice. Now, the history of this country has included discretionary sentencing within a range without any guidance to the judge since the 1790 Crimes Act. And through much of the 19th century, many statutes were written that way. The idea that due process vagueness analysis would somehow invalidate that contradicts cases like Medina, which take as their touchstone for due process historical practice. I also think that the purposes of what later was announced as the vagueness doctrine are not implicated in traditional sentencing. The reason for that is not that traditional sentencing produces uniform or predictable results. It does not. It maximizes instead another important value of sentencing, which is individualization or proportionality. Sentencing involves a large array of facts that are very difficult to reduce to rules. The traditional sentencing process relies on the judge and the defendant, in the courtroom with counsel, to examine the multiplicity of facts that bear on appropriate sentencing and then to select a sentence within that range. That is not arbitrary. We have cited in footnote 2 of our reply brief a case from this Court where the Court described that as conscientious judgment rather than arbitrary action. It therefore does not implicate the purpose of the due-process vagueness doctrine. On the other hand, the Sentencing Guidelines as this Court has described them in recent opinions that have examined the advisory system that's been put into place post-Booker, stress that that system injects law into the sentencing process.

This date -- and it's not unusual for the Ninth Circuit. This dates back to 1995 in a case called Concha that interpreted Rule 41. And I'm going to quote from that case. Here's what the Ninth Circuit said: Quote, ""A voluntary dismissal with prejudice permits the appellate court to review the action that caused him to dismiss his case.""

Kovner</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court in Goodyear and Daimler rejected approaches to general jurisdiction that would allow plaintiff in one State to sue a national company for product liability in all of the other 49 States, calling those approaches exorbitant and unacceptably grasping. The California Supreme Court misunderstood this Court's decisions when it allowed that same result under the label of specific jurisdiction. As this Court explained in Goodyear, specific jurisdiction lets a State exercise authority over activity within its borders, which it has a strong interest in controlling. But a State lacks a comparable interest in exercising authority over out-of-State defendants for entirely out-of-State conduct.</text>",2016

Russell</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act applies to debt collectors. Debt collector is defined in the Act as the most relevant here to include individuals who regularly collect debts owed or due another. When Respondent Santander was originally hired to collect Petitioners' defaulted car loans, there's no question that it was collecting the debt owed or due another under anyone's interpretation of that term. The question in this case is whether that changed when Santander purchased an assignment of that debt. The Fourth Circuit held that it did, wrongly, based on its interpretation of the key phrase ""owed or due another,"" which is used twice in the definition of debt collector, once in the principal definition, and again in the Clause (F) exceptions. The problem with that interpretation is that it cannot be squared with the use of the same phrase in the Clause (F) exceptions, particularly with respect to Clause (F)(iv) With the Court's indulgence, I would like to walk through that exception. And it's found on page 4A of the appendix to the blue brief. As I mentioned, this is an exception for somebody who otherwise qualifies as a debt collector under the main definition for somebody who is collecting a debt owed or due another. And that same requirement is repeated at the beginning of Clause (F) It has to be somebody -- any person collecting or attempting to collect a debt owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another, and then it says to the extent such activity meets one of four qualifications. And the one I want to focus on is the fourth, and that applies to somebody who's engaged in activity concerning a debt obtained by such person as a secured party in a commercial credit transaction involving the creditor. Now, I think the parties agree with the FTC's interpretation of this. This is applying to a situation in which a company, like a car dealership, has gotten a commercial loan from a bank and put up as collateral the debts that it's owed by its customers, say, car loans. The only circumstance in which that kind of entity is ever going to be collecting on a consumer debt, which is required at the beginning of Clause (F), is that they've either foreclosed on the collateral, in which case under the UCC, they will send a notice to the -- the consumers saying we have been assigned this debt; start sending the debt to us. And if the consumer asks for it, they have to send proof of the assignment. Or if the assignment was given to them at the outset as part of the secured credit transaction. The problem for Respondents is that in either case, the bank is only ever going to be doing exactly what a debt purchaser does, which is collecting from the consumers a debt that has been assigned to it and keeping it on its own account. Respondent's only answer to this is to say that this -- no, no, this is a provision that is addressed at the bank that is simply holding the debts as collateral. But that can't be right, because at the very beginning of (F)(iv) -- or (F) -- and Congress made clear that the exception only applies to somebody who is actually collecting or attempting to collect a debt. And somebody who is simply holding a collateral is not collecting or attempting to collect the consumer debts. Now, as a consequence, adopting Respondent's interpretation that somebody who's collecting on its own account through an assignment, as a debt purchaser does, as the commercial creditor does in the scenario we've just described, in our view, they're not collecting the debt owed or due another. And as a consequence, they cannot be the person to whom Congress is referring in subsection (F)(iv) It is an exception that not only is completely surplusage and a null set, it's a -- an exception that renders itself surplusage.

The Fourth Circuit held that it did, wrongly, based on its interpretation of the key phrase ""owed or due another,"" which is used twice in the definition of debt collector, once in the principal definition, and again in the Clause (F) exceptions. The problem with that interpretation is that it cannot be squared with the use of the same phrase in the Clause (F) exceptions, particularly with respect to Clause (F)(iv) With the Court's indulgence, I would like to walk through that exception. And it's found on page 4A of the appendix to the blue brief. As I mentioned, this is an exception for somebody who otherwise qualifies as a debt collector under the main definition for somebody who is collecting a debt owed or due another. And that same requirement is repeated at the beginning of Clause (F) It has to be somebody -- any person collecting or attempting to collect a debt owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another, and then it says to the extent such activity meets one of four qualifications. And the one I want to focus on is the fourth, and that applies to somebody who's engaged in activity concerning a debt obtained by such person as a secured party in a commercial credit transaction involving the creditor. Now, I think the parties agree with the FTC's interpretation of this. This is applying to a situation in which a company, like a car dealership, has gotten a commercial loan from a bank and put up as collateral the debts that it's owed by its customers, say, car loans. The only circumstance in which that kind of entity is ever going to be collecting on a consumer debt, which is required at the beginning of Clause (F), is that they've either foreclosed on the collateral, in which case under the UCC, they will send a notice to the -- the consumers saying we have been assigned this debt; start sending the debt to us. And if the consumer asks for it, they have to send proof of the assignment. Or if the assignment was given to them at the outset as part of the secured credit transaction. The problem for Respondents is that in either case, the bank is only ever going to be doing exactly what a debt purchaser does, which is collecting from the consumers a debt that has been assigned to it and keeping it on its own account. Respondent's only answer to this is to say that this -- no, no, this is a provision that is addressed at the bank that is simply holding the debts as collateral. But that can't be right, because at the very beginning of (F)(iv) -- or (F) -- and Congress made clear that the exception only applies to somebody who is actually collecting or attempting to collect a debt. And somebody who is simply holding a collateral is not collecting or attempting to collect the consumer debts. Now, as a consequence, adopting Respondent's interpretation that somebody who's collecting on its own account through an assignment, as a debt purchaser does, as the commercial creditor does in the scenario we've just described, in our view, they're not collecting the debt owed or due another. And as a consequence, they cannot be the person to whom Congress is referring in subsection (F)(iv) It is an exception that not only is completely surplusage and a null set, it's a -- an exception that renders itself surplusage.

Stewart</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to first to pick up on a point that Ms. Blatt alluded to when she was describing the -- the history of the statute and its amendment. I think the statute in its current form is probably not the type of provision that Congress would draft if it were doing the whole thing in one fell swoop. But it's important to understand that the text of the -- the current provision is the combination of things that were done in 1974 and things that were done in 1980. Congress enacted the original church plan provision. Presumably, it had in mind particular plans that were established and maintained by churches and it covered those; and pretty quickly, problems came to light. Other types of plans were found not to be covered by the administrative agency that Congress evidently believed should be covered. And so when Congress amended the provision in 1980, it chose to work within the existing framework. We're not quite sure why, but at least one plausible explanation would be there were some church plans that had been found to be covered under the old ""established and maintained by a church"" language. Congress may have wanted to avoid any possible inference that those plans were no longer covered, and so it retained the original language, but defined it to include something else. And when Congress passed the -- the provision that Ms. Blatt was discussing earlier, (C)(i), that refers to a plan established and maintained for its employees includes a plan maintained by a principal purpose organization, I -- I think it's -- it's helpful to recognize that there are two different sorts of definitional provisions that Congress sometimes enacts. Sometimes when Congress enacts a definition, it's trying to clarify what the defined term really means. And when Congress acts in that way, we tend to strain to read the definition in a way that makes it consistent with ordinary understandings of a defined term. But sometimes Congress will enact a provision that says something like the -- for purposes of this statute, the term ""State"" includes the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. When Congress does that, it's not trying to explain what State really means; it's simply using a shorthand formulation to say, for purposes of this statute, we want D.C. and Puerto Rico to be treated the same way that the 50 States would be treated. And that's really what Congress was doing in the 1980 amendment. When it defined the term ""plan established and maintained by a church"" to include plans that satisfied the prerequisites in the amendments, it -- it was not saying this is what a plan established and maintained by a church really is.

When it defined the term ""plan established and maintained by a church"" to include plans that satisfied the prerequisites in the amendments, it -- it was not saying this is what a plan established and maintained by a church really is.

17856,2016.16-74-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Can you -- can you tell me what provision of ERISA -- and I'll ask Mr. Feldman the same thing if I have the chance -- what provision of ERISA explains which entity, if any, is responsible for paying benefits if, for example, a defined benefit plan is unable to do that with the assets in the plan?","<speaker>Malcolm L. Stewart</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to first to pick up on a point that Ms. Blatt alluded to when she was describing the -- the history of the statute and its amendment. I think the statute in its current form is probably not the type of provision that Congress would draft if it were doing the whole thing in one fell swoop. But it's important to understand that the text of the -- the current provision is the combination of things that were done in 1974 and things that were done in 1980. Congress enacted the original church plan provision. Presumably, it had in mind particular plans that were established and maintained by churches and it covered those; and pretty quickly, problems came to light. Other types of plans were found not to be covered by the administrative agency that Congress evidently believed should be covered. And so when Congress amended the provision in 1980, it chose to work within the existing framework. We're not quite sure why, but at least one plausible explanation would be there were some church plans that had been found to be covered under the old ""established and maintained by a church"" language. Congress may have wanted to avoid any possible inference that those plans were no longer covered, and so it retained the original language, but defined it to include something else. And when Congress passed the -- the provision that Ms. Blatt was discussing earlier, (C)(i), that refers to a plan established and maintained for its employees includes a plan maintained by a principal purpose organization, I -- I think it's -- it's helpful to recognize that there are two different sorts of definitional provisions that Congress sometimes enacts. Sometimes when Congress enacts a definition, it's trying to clarify what the defined term really means. And when Congress acts in that way, we tend to strain to read the definition in a way that makes it consistent with ordinary understandings of a defined term. But sometimes Congress will enact a provision that says something like the -- for purposes of this statute, the term ""State"" includes the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. When Congress does that, it's not trying to explain what State really means; it's simply using a shorthand formulation to say, for purposes of this statute, we want D.C. and Puerto Rico to be treated the same way that the 50 States would be treated. And that's really what Congress was doing in the 1980 amendment. When it defined the term ""plan established and maintained by a church"" to include plans that satisfied the prerequisites in the amendments, it -- it was not saying this is what a plan established and maintained by a church really is. It was saying, for purposes of the exempt -- of the church plan exemption, we want these to be treated the same.</text>",2016

Elias</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The district court created out of whole cloth a new legal standard that permitted Virginia to apply a one-size-fits-all, 55 percent racial floor to all 12 of its predominantly black districts. Virginia applied this 55 percent rule to move voters in and move voters out of districts on the basis of race, regardless of the differences in voting patterns, geography, demographics, or the actual interests of black voters in each of those districts. This actual conflict test, which the D.C. -- which -- I'm sorry -- which the district court invented for predominance has no basis in this Court's jurisprudence.

In doing so, Congress has always required that the persons involved have a demonstrated and sufficient connection to the United States, either in themselves or through their parents, to warrant the conferral of citizenship, because citizenship carries with it attendant duties and rights on the part of the individual, and important duties of protection and obligation on the part of the United States government.

Holding other things constant, had he been the mother instead of the father, there would be no question that he transmitted citizenship to Respondent under Section 1409. But the statute bars him from doing so on the same terms of the mother is not based on any innate or biological difference between men and women or mothers and fathers, nor does it ensure an interest in reducing statelessness, or -- nor does it serve an interest in reducing statelessness or ensuring that -- that citizenship by descent pass only to those children who are likely to learn American values. Both of the government's justifications for the gender differential at here therefore fail. I would like to begin by addressing the standard of review.

In either event, that single notice of appeal perfects appeal of all issues that arise within that judgment and sentence when it is fully completed. We know this in part because of the Court's decision in Dolan. In Dolan the Court struggled with the mechanics. How was the Court going to evaluate the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act? What does it require a district court to do? And after struggling through those mechanics, the Court said that essentially the second document fills in an amount-related blank in the original judgment that made clear that restitution was applicable. It is clear that what happens second, the restitution part, is nothing more than a completion of the original judgment and sentence. It is not a new judgment. It is not a new sentence. It is simply a completion, a fill-in-the-blanks as the Court has phrased it. We know not only from Dolan that this should be the case, but we know it also by looking at the criminal appellate rules as they relate to criminal cases.

Stewart</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address the domestic exhaustion issue first, and I'd like to begin by responding to Justice Kennedy's question about why hasn't the exhaustion doctrine been codified. The Court's historic cases in the domestic exhaustion field have located the exhaustion principle in the language of the predecessors of what is now 35 U.S.C. 154(a)(1) That is the provision of the Patent Act that says the patent owner has the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the patented invention. And in addressing predecessor versions of that language, this Court said those exclusive rights in essence don't encompass the right to control resale or use of a lawfully sold article. For example, in Bauer & Cie v. O'Donnell, the Court said -- addressed the proper interpretation of the exclusive right to vend, and it said the right to vend was exercised when the first authorized sale was made. The right to vend does not encompass the right to set resale prices. In motion picture patents, the Court said that its task was to determine the meaning of Congress enacting the predecessor version of 154(a)(1). In -- in order -- other cases, the Court has referred to lawfully sold articles as being no longer under the protection of the act of Congress, or that the exhaustion rule delimits the scope of the patent grant. So it's true that the Patent Act doesn't contain an analogue to 17 U.S.C. 109(a), which is the Copyright Act provision that specifically addresses the scope of exhaustion, but the exhaustion doctrine has historically been understood by this Court as a gloss on the exclusive rights conferred by 154(a)(1) and its predecessors, and unless Congress wanted to change the exhaustion rule, either to get -- get rid of it entirely or to substitute some different triggering event, there was no need for it to amend -- to -- to codify an explicit exhaustion provision by continuing in effect and by tweaking the exclusive rights conferred by the grant of a patent, Congress should be understood to have manifested its intention that historic conceptions of domestic -- domestic exhaustion would continue to have sway. Now, the second point I make about domestic exhaustion is that the court of appeals' err, in our view, stem to a large extent from its misreading of general talking pictures. General talking pictures dealt not with a -- not with simply a restriction on the use that purchasers could make after an article had been lawfully sold. It dealt with the conditions on which its patentee's licensee could sell the article in the first place. And the -- the exhaustion doctrine is also -- often referred to colloquially as the first-sale doctrine, and I think that's a reason -- there's a reason for that. It's that the presence or absence of exhaustion turns on whether there has been a lawful first sale, and if the licensee departs from the instruction of the patentee and sells the article in a way that is not authorized, there's no lawful first sale, and therefore, no patent exhaustion. But once the article has been lawfully sold, any restrictions on resale or use that the patentee purports to impose downstream can be enforceable only under contract law or commercial law, not under patent law. And that brings me to my third point about domestic exhaustion, which is one of the arguments on the other side is -- on the Respondent's side is that application of domestic exhaustion principles here would prevent parties from reaching agreements that might be economically advantageous to both of them. And so the Respondent says, well, if I have had particular buyer who only wants to use the cartridge once and doesn't want to pay extra for the privilege of reusing it, if he never intends to do that, why shouldn't we be able to negotiate a deal under which I charge him less in return for his commitment to only use it once? And the answer is nothing in the exhaustion doctrine prevents parties from reaching those agreements and enforcing them as a matter of contract law, if they are enforceable under the -- the law of the relevant jurisdiction. The policy judgment that this Court has historically attributed to Congress is not a judgment that these sorts of restrictions are bad or should be unenforceable. It's simply a judgment that possession of a patent doesn't give the patentee any greater rights to make or enforce restrictions like this than a seller of similar unpatented property would have under the rules of -- of general contract law. And so, in several of the exhaustion decisions, the Court has distinguished between the limits on patent remedies and the alternative remedies that might be available under what the Court has often referred to as the general law, the body of contract and commercial law that applies to -- to all sellers. I'd like to turn now, if I may, to the question of international exhaustion. And the position of the United States on -- on this issue is between that of the two parties, it's our view that a patent -- a U.S. patent owner who sells goods -- patented goods abroad should be able to reserve its U.S. rights but need -- needs to do so expressly. And I'd like to start --</text>",2016

Pincus</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case brings before the Court two questions regarding the patent exhaustion doctrine, also known as the first sale doctrine. As this Court said in Bowman, under that doctrine, the initial authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item. And by exhausting the patentee's monopoly on that item, the sale confers on the purchaser, or any subsequent owner, the right to use or sell the thing as he sees fit. That principle goes back, of course, to the 15th century. The common law refused to enforce restraints on alienations of chattels based on the fundamental insight that you own the goods that you buy, and you should be able to do with them what you wish, and that clouds over Title -- hurt the marketability of goods and intercommerce, and importantly, in the patent context, allowing these downstream restrictions to be forced would preempt secondary markets with -- which check the patent owner's monopoly power. Let me begin with the first question, which is whether the authorized sale of an article embodying the patent exhausts patent rights with respect to that article, or whether the patentee may impose restrictions enforceable under patent laws, such as on resale, repair or reuse simply by stating such a restriction in the sales agreement.

We are going to market this to RVs, but we know it's really not suitable for RVs. And so if people put it on an RV and they are driving around in a hot climate, the tire is going to explode.

26070,2016.15-9260-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor,"-- I mean, the lack of beauty of the guidelines is they're so artificial on so many levels; all right? What differentiates a normal theft from a robbery is the use of force. And the guidelines, in defining the guidelines range for a theft, starts at a much, much lower base level. Starts at a seven, okay? For a robbery, it starts at a base level of 20. Once you start with that huge difference between the use of force and the nonuse of force, obviously, the robbery guideline is always going to include the use of force. The fact that it might be with a gun as opposed to a knife as opposed to a threat of violence or whatever else you want to define it, the use of force is inherent already in the guideline calculation because, otherwise, that -- there's no reason. They could have just had one table and said, if you rob someone, if it was a pure calculation, as you suggest it, without thinking about the gun, it would have been $20,000 is taken, we're all going to start at a offense level of five years and build up from there. That's not what the guidelines do. So when you're taking discretion away from a judge, I think that's one of the reasons we often require specificity, because the guidelines are artificial in so many different ways.

But the Second Circuit majority then formulated its own list merger theory of liability, premising liability on the alleged decision of Attorney General Ashcroft to merge the New York list of detainees, which had not been fully vetted, with the INS list, thereby continuing the hold-until-cleared policy for detainees on both lists. Bivens' liability does not attach here for at least three reasons. First, the Bivens remedy should not be extended to national security and immigration policy decisions by senior officials in the wake of the September 11 attacks.

Second, the list merger theory suffers from the same pleading deficiencies that this Court identified in Iqbal itself.

Dabney</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court in this case is presented with an historic choice. That choice is between upholding or destroying venue protections that Congress provided in 28 U.S.C. 1400(b), and that this Court interpreting that statute declared to exist in its Fourco Glass decision. And the correct choice, we submit, is to adhere to this Court's existing, long-established interpretation of Section 1400(b) and to reject the new call for a new revisionist interpretation that would render Section 1400(b) nugatory in this case and in all but the most unusual cases. I'd like to open first with some undeniable points. In Fourco Glass, this Court made two holdings about 1400(b) that control this case. The first is this Court interpreted Section 1400(b) as a standalone. It's the sole and exclusive provision governing venue in patent cases and is not to be supplemented with Section 1391.</text>",2016

Saharsky</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: So there are two questions before the Court. The Court said in Omni that in order to assert personal jurisdiction, you have to have a statute or a rule making the defendant amenable to service of process. There's a question of, here, is it Section 56 or Montana law. We've explained why we think it's Montana law. And then the second question is if they're exercising service of process on Montana law, does -- is that general jurisdiction consistent with the standards the Court set out in Daimler and Goodyear, and we don't think it is. So on -- particularly on the Section 56 question, because that's one where there's a strong Federal interest in not having words that don't say anything about service of process being interpreted to in fact say something about service of process, we have a first sentence that refers to venue only in Federal courts, and then a second sentence referring to State courts. But all it does is to clarify that there's concurrent jurisdiction in the State courts. And we just don't see how you can get to conferral of personal jurisdiction in the State courts, especially when we know, very clearly from the legislative record, that Congress was trying to solve two particular problems, the first in the first sentence with venue in Federal courts, and then the second in the sentence -- second sentence with making sure that State courts understood that they could hear these claims. I think it is also noticeable, as Petitioner's counsel suggested, that we have not -- we are not aware of any example in which Congress has used language of this type to confer personal -- or even more explicit language to confer personal jurisdiction in the State courts, and also, that even at the time, back in 1910, Congress knew how to confer personal jurisdiction if it wanted to. We gave examples in -- of the Clayton Act from 1914 in our brief, the Credit Mobilier Act in Petitioner's brief, and then these were also discussed in the Robertson case from 1925. In that, Congress knows how to do venue versus service of process. That has continued up through the Court's decision in Omni. So we just don't think that Section 56 should be interpreted to be the first statute -- statute to do it, especially where the implication with respect to the second question would be to say that a company like BNSF is subject to general personal jurisdiction in 28 or more States.

And then your adversary's position that the Texas court has already said that under Texas law, you can't serve this way.","<speaker>Elaine J. Goldenberg</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Article 10(a) of the Hague Service Convention permits service through postal channels on persons abroad if the law of the forum State -- that's the State where the case is pending -- authorizes such service and if the receiving State where the mail will be delivered hasn't objected to Article 10(a). And I'd like to start with this permit authorize framework, because I think there's been a lot of confusion in the lower courts on this subject. The question presented here is perhaps phrased a little inartfully in terms of authorization, and it would be really helpful if this Court would clarify this point. Article 10(a) says that provided the State of destination does not object, the present convention shall not interfere with the freedom to send judicial documents by postal channels to persons abroad. So it is not interfering with freedom. It is -- it's not the same thing as providing an affirmative authorization for service by mail. That affirmative authorization has to be found elsewhere. And the place where you find it is in the law of the forum State. So, for instance, in our Federal system, if you look at Rule 4 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, there is a subsection of Rule 4 that says where an international agreement permits, but does not authorize service on persons abroad, here are a bunch of things you can do. And some of those options include service by mail, using registered mail by -- sent by the clerk of the court, service by mail if the district court judge in a particular case directs it, and so on. So that's where you get the authorization. You have to -- the forum State has to authorize the service by mail on a person abroad. At the other end of the process, you have to see whether the receiving State has objected to service by mail. And as my friend indicated, nearly half of the countries that have acceded to or ratified this treaty have indeed objected to service by mail.

Rice</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court: The jury repeatedly deadlocked as to Russell Overton telling the court it would be impossible to reach a verdict and returning a conviction only after multiple assertions of impasse, and 40 to 50 additional votes. In this incredibly close case the government not only wrongfully suppressed evidence of two alternative perpetrators, but also withheld critical impeachment evidence concerning a key witness against Overton Carrie Eleby. The case against Overton was especially weak and Eleby's testimony played an especially important role in that case. I'd like to begin by briefly addressing the weaknesses in the government's case here. At trial the government presented three key witnesses against Overton who placed him in the alley during the attack. The two corroborators, Alston Bennett and Carrie Eleby. All of those witnesses had serious credibility problems and their stories diverged in several significant respects, including among other things about who was involved and what role they supposedly played. At the same time, another purported eye witness who the government later emphasized as the key to its case, affirmatively denied seeing Overton in the alley during the attack even though Overton is exceptionally tall and witness knew him personally.</text>",2016

Gershengorn</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress provided extensive substantive and procedural protections for aliens whom the government wishes to remove, but at the same time, addressed the real concerns about recidivism and flight risk by providing for mandatory detention during removal proceedings for certain categories of criminal aliens and aliens arriving at our shores. The Ninth Circuit undid that legislative balance, invoking principles of constitutional avoidance to require the government to release those aliens unless the government can prove by a preponderance of the evidence every six months that detention remains necessary. The Ninth Circuit's decision is a serious misuse of the constitutional avoidance canon. With respect to arriving aliens, there is no constitutional problem to avoid. As even the Ninth Circuit recognized, the statute is constitutional in the vast majority of applications, and any concerns about outlier cases involving lawful permanent residents can be dressed in as-applied challenges. And with respect to criminal aliens, the text of the statute forecloses the Ninth Circuit's approach, and in any event, the statute is constitutional as written under this Court's decision in Demore. The net result of the Ninth Circuit's one-size-fits-all rule is -- is a regime that's at odds with the text that Congress enacted. It undermines DHS's enforcement priorities, and it creates incentives for individual aliens to delay their removal proceedings.</text>",2016

And why would it not be the case that the -- that the death or injury in such a case is also proximately caused by that violation? In other words, proximate cause says what kind of things are foreseeable, and it says -- it sets an outer bound, and it says totally flukey, random things we're not going to say are proximately caused.
