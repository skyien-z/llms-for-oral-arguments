Gant</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: While this case is about the FDCPA, it is also fundamentally about the relationship between this Court and Congress. That relationship has long been governed in part by two important presumptions relevant here: first, that Congress legislates against the backdrop of the common law and, second, that Congress legislates aware of this Court's decisions. When Congress enacted the FDCPA in 1977, this Court had long ago adopted a common law rule eventually known as the discovery rule applicable to cases of fraud and concealment. Citing to and quoting the Bailey decision of this Court from 1875, in Holmberg in 1946, this Court stated that it had long ago adopted as its own the old chancery rule, that where a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and remains in ignorance of it without any false or want of diligence or care on his part, the bar of the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is discovered, though there will be no special circumstance or efforts on the part of the party committing the fraud to conceal it from the knowledge of the other party. The Court then continued in Holmberg explaining unequivocally this equitable doctrine is read into every federal statute of limitation and added even those where ""an explicit statute of limitation for bringing suit."" The United States concedes, as it has in prior cases, that there is a common law discovery rule applicable to fraud and concealment. In the decision below, the Third Circuit never mentioned the Holmberg case. Its analysis began and ended with two words in Section 813(d), ""violation occurred."" The Third Circuit understood that those two words by implication, not expressly, but by implication -- that's at appendix page 8 -- displaced the common law discovery rule applicable to fraud. In reaching this conclusion, the Third Circuit deployed what I believe is a false dichotomy, what the Third Circuit described on the one hand as an occurrence rule and on the other hand a common law discovery rule. And in the view of the Third Circuit, if a -- Congress deploys in a statute a so-called occurrence rule, a common law discovery rule is presumed to be displaced. The Third Circuit cited no decision of this Court in setting forth this dichotomy between an occurrence rule and a common law discovery rule. The analysis is at page 6 of the appendix. That conclusion of the Third Circuit is also in opposition to this Court's decision in 1918 in the Exploration case, which is discussed at length in our brief and the briefs of the other parties. There, that is, I think, fairly characterized as an occurrence rule. The statute in Exploration ran from the date of issuance of a land patent. So that was a date certain tied to facts.

Normally, we use law enforcement investigative tools like subpoenas to investigate known crimes and not to pursue individuals' defined crimes. That's a principle you're well familiar with from your time at the Department of Justice. And I'm wondering what limiting principle you offer us here that can prevent that danger. The first one was it has to be pertinent to a legislative purpose, but I think, as we've explored, that's very, very broad and -- and maybe limitless, some would suggest on the other side at least. Constitutional privileges, if you're investigating someone in their private capacity, there are going to be few, maybe attorney-client privilege, things like that. And it can't be burdensome, I heard, was your third, but in an age where everything's online and can be handed over on a disk or a thumb drive, that -- that -- that much pretty much disappears too.

I want to follow up on the line of questioning that several of my colleagues have pursued, the Chief Justice, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Alito, Justice Kagan, and others, which I think come down to the idea of limitless authority and how to deal with that. The other side says that allowing these subpoenas and subpoenas like these, say, for medical records, would be a grave threat to future presidencies. It would be open season, they say, on private records of anyone who is President and maybe other government officials too. And they worry about the harassing nature of subpoenas like that. You say -- and Justice Gorsuch was just exploring this -- it's okay so long as it's pertinent to a legislative purpose. But I think everyone has explore -- explored with you that just about everything can be characterized, in terms of a subpoena, as pertinent to a legislative purpose. I don't think you could answer the Chief Justice's question about something that wasn't.

How can the Court balance those interests?

We -- we couldn't have known that the anchor was there in the river when we hit it and, therefore, we shouldn't be liable. The other side says, no, there's a warranty of safe berth, but at least as it's been interpreted by many courts, including the English court you -- you -- you alluded to earlier, there's an exception for abnormal circumstances under -- under the particular circumstances. I think you alluded to it as well in these circumstances at this time and this place. It seems to me that those two rules, strict liability minus abnormal circumstances and negligence, are awfully close at the end of the day. And if that -- is that true, first of all?

Yes, this is a contract case, but Mr. Phillips has argued for something like a due diligence, right? I think of it as really a negligence-type standard. You've argued for something more like strict liability, right, that it's a warranty, absolute. But you've also recognized, at least in passing, that there's an exception to that warranty for abnormal circumstances, whatever that is. Nobody knows what that is. At the end of the day, don't the two wind up in pretty much the same place?

As this Court's already recognized this morning, some contracts include a traditional safe-berth clause, which gives the charterer the right to designate the port but requires that the charterer choose a port that is safe. In stark contrast, other contrasts -- other contracts include a more limited clause, which expressly provides that the charterer will not be liable so long as it exercises due diligence in selecting the port or expressly disclaims a warranty of safety. The parties here chose the first traditional type of clause, which lacks any due diligence language. By the time they had done so, courts, arbitrators, and scholars on both sides of the Atlantic had for decades construed the safe-berth clause as a warranty that the charterer would choose a port that is actually safe, not merely one that the charterer believes to be safe after the exercise of due diligence.</text>",2019

Phillips</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The basic issue in this case is what ought to be the default rule for what is the generally referred to as safe-port or safe-berth clause in the standard charter party form that has, frankly, governed the transportation of ocean-going vessels for a very, very long time. There are -- the court below concluded that -- based on the language referring specifically to ""staying afloat and safely,"" that this imposed a strict liability on the charterer, my client, who designated that Paulsboro, New Jersey, would be the port of entry for these particular goods. That is an extraordinary interpretation under the circumstances in which my client is now facing well in excess of $140 million in -- in -- in an award based solely on an accident that was, candidly, unknown and unknowable at the time that the designation was made and, candidly, at any time until the actual allision occurred. The question then is, is there a different or better or more sensible default rule that the Court might turn to? And it seems worth spending a second and just focusing on the exact language of this clause, which is at the appendix to the Petitioners' brief at 8a. ""The vessel shall discharge at any safe place or wharf"" -- that, of course, says nothing about any obligations of any of the parties -- ""which shall be designated and procured by the charterer"" -- so that is the obligation of my client to designate and -- and procure the space -- ""provided that the vessel can proceed thereto, lie at, and depart therefrom always safely afloat, any lighterage being at the expense, risk, and peril of the charterer."" And it seems to me the difficulty with saying that this is an unlimited source of liability on a strict liability theory is that why would you identify lighterage as the specific remedy to be worried about unless what you're really concerned about is, has the charterer made essentially a safe choice as far as everyone can tell, and then, when the captain gets there, if for whatever reason the captain in his or her judgment decides it's not a safe choice and decides to go off into another port or to offload some portion at the expense and the risk, all of that is then imposed upon the charterer.</text>",2019
