Is that still good law?","<speaker>Neal Kumar Katyal</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State seeks to put James McKinney to death even though he's never once had a sentencing proceeding that complies with current law. There are two separate paths for McKinney to win. The path in question 1 argues that the Arizona Supreme Court reopened McKinney's sentencing proceeding. The Ninth Circuit had earlier granted a conditional writ of habeas corpus and gave the State the option of either imposing a life sentence or seeking the death penalty again. The State chose the latter, which required brand new state action in the form of new sentencing. The Arizona Supreme Court then did everything itself just as it had in 1996. That was wrong. This Court's decisions in Ring and Hurst require a jury sentencing. If McKinney were sentenced today, no one doubts he'd be entitled to a jury trial. The State claims this would open the floodgates. But McKinney is not seeking to use Ring retroactively as a sword to challenge his earlier proceedings. Rather, he's saying that when the State conducts a new proceeding, that sentencing must comply with current law. Otherwise, the implications would be frightening. For example, a state could run a re-sentencing today in 2019 with a pre-Batson jury, with race-based jury strikes. That can't be right. And the second path, set out in question 2, is for this Court to simply say that the Eddings violation in this case requires a remand to the trial court for sentencing and that the appellate court was wrong to perform that delicate task itself. This breaks no new ground. Indeed, this Court has, on five separate occasions since the 1982 Eddings decision, ordered resentencing for Eddings violations. Both paths get McKinney to the same destination, but they are separate. Question 2 is limited to the small universe of Eddings violations and how to fix them. And question 1, by contrast, is about when sentencing proceedings lose their finality and are reopened. I'm fine waiving the rest of my time if there are questions.</text>",2019

There are two separate paths for McKinney to win. The path in question 1 argues that the Arizona Supreme Court reopened McKinney's sentencing proceeding. The Ninth Circuit had earlier granted a conditional writ of habeas corpus and gave the State the option of either imposing a life sentence or seeking the death penalty again. The State chose the latter, which required brand new state action in the form of new sentencing. The Arizona Supreme Court then did everything itself just as it had in 1996. That was wrong. This Court's decisions in Ring and Hurst require a jury sentencing. If McKinney were sentenced today, no one doubts he'd be entitled to a jury trial. The State claims this would open the floodgates. But McKinney is not seeking to use Ring retroactively as a sword to challenge his earlier proceedings. Rather, he's saying that when the State conducts a new proceeding, that sentencing must comply with current law. Otherwise, the implications would be frightening. For example, a state could run a re-sentencing today in 2019 with a pre-Batson jury, with race-based jury strikes. That can't be right. And the second path, set out in question 2, is for this Court to simply say that the Eddings violation in this case requires a remand to the trial court for sentencing and that the appellate court was wrong to perform that delicate task itself. This breaks no new ground. Indeed, this Court has, on five separate occasions since the 1982 Eddings decision, ordered resentencing for Eddings violations.

First, the Convention as a whole only ever requires contracting states to enforce arbitration agreements; it never prohibits them -- them from doing so.

It does not speak to the scope of valid agreements, including who may be bound or who may invoke those agreements.

If there are some universe of agreements that could be only domestically enforceable but are not enforceable under the Convention, then what?","<speaker>Shay Dvoretzky</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If this case involved a domestic arbitration agreement, GE Energy could enforce it as long as it could satisfy domestic non-signatory enforcement doctrines like equitable estoppel. The question here is whether the New York Convention prohibits that same result for international arbitration agreements. It does not. The Convention is simply silent about enforcement by non-signatories. That silence is consistent with the Convention's design, which sets a floor, not a ceiling, for enforcing arbitration agreements and awards. The Convention says that states must do certain things to promote arbitration. It doesn't say they can't to do more than the Convention requires. Moreover, Article II, the principal provision about arbitration agreements, is especially short. It is not a comprehensive scheme that displaces all sovereign authority to enforce domestic laws about arbitration agreements. All relevant sources of meaning understand the Convention this same way. Other contracting states are close to unanimous that the Convention does not preempt domestic law allowing non-signatory enforcement. The United States, the Restatement, UNCITRAL, and leading commentators agree. In allowing doctrines like equitable estoppel serves the Convention's overriding purpose, to overcome widespread resistance to arbitration. The Eleventh Circuit nevertheless interpreted the definition of ""agreement in writing"" to preclude non-signatory enforcement. This Court should not make the United States an outlier by adopting that position. Article II(2) just specifies the kinds of agreements that states at a minimum must recognize. It doesn't limit who can enforce them. Respondents themselves don't defend the Eleventh Circuit's signature-based rule.

But there are no statistics about how big or small debt collection is with respect to robo- -- robot -- robo-calls generally or with respect to consumer collection. And even if you could show me that they were a small part of the intrusions on people, they certainly are a big emotional complaint because they generate the most ire by citizens. But putting that aside, you haven't shown me why government-backed debt calls are any different than commercial calls, private commercial calls for debt. In both situations, the debtor would expect a call about debts they owe. That's an interest that the government's claimed, but, you know, so what? Both debtors. So there is a discrimination aspect to this case that does raise the equal protection ground.

Clement</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Respondents' effort to convert all of the land traversed by a Park Service-administered trail into lands in the National Park Service fails for reasons of text, context, and consequences. First, as a matter of text, multiple provisions of the Trails Act draw a distinction between the trail and the land it traverses and makes clear that administrative authority is granted only over the former and leaves the latter jurisdiction over the lands themselves undisturbed. Moreover, the Trails Act itself makes clear that the trail can be moved. It makes sense for a trail or a trail route to move every time a tree falls. It doesn't make sense for the status of lands to change every time the route moves. The context powerfully reinforces this key distinction.

2656,2019.18-725-t01,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Mr. Unikowsky, could I -- could I possibly get an argument off the table? Do you really want to argue that the concept of inadmissibility is not a status?","<speaker>Adam G. Unikowsky</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question before the Court today is, what does it mean for an offense to render an alien inadmissible for purposes of the stop-time rule? The Court should hold that an offense renders an alien inadmissible if the immigration judge finds that the offense renders the alien inadmissible at the removal hearing that precipitates the need to apply the stop-time rule. If the Court disagrees with that and agrees with the Eleventh Circuit that inadmissible is a status, it should hold that an alien acquires that status when the alien is capable of being charged with inadmissibility. In this case, neither condition is satisfied. Petitioner was not found inadmissible. He wasn't capable of being found inadmissible. Therefore, he was not rendered inadmissible. So I'd like to begin this morning with a concession the government makes at pages 29 and 30 of its brief which I think narrows the issues in this case somewhat. So the government concedes that when the words ""inadmissible"" and ""removable,"" which are the crucial words in the stop-time rule, when those words are used in a statute that has a connection to the alien's own removal proceeding, they're a reference to the charge against the alien at that proceeding. They're not a status. So the government agrees that in those contexts, its proposed interpretation of the words ""inadmissible"" and ""removable"" in the stop-time rule is incorrect. So, in Section 1226, the mandatory detention statute, that says that an alien who is inadmissible by reason of having committed an offense under Section 1182 is subject to mandatory detention, the government agrees there that ""inadmissible"" is a reference to inadmissible at the proceeding, not just the status of being inadmissible. The government says that's natural in that context, and we agree, because that's a statute with the relationship to the alien's removal. Same thing in Section 1252. That's the jurisdiction-stripping statute. That says that courts of appeals don't have jurisdiction to hear petitions for review by an alien who is removable for certain specified reasons. There, too, the government agrees removable is not the status; it's a reference to the actual charge at the hearing, and they say that's natural in that context because the statute has a connection to the alien's removal proceeding. So the question in this case boils down to whether the government has put forward a sufficient case for holding that the words ""inadmissible"" and ""removable"" in the stop-time rule mean something different from what it concedes they mean in these adjacent or nearby statutes addressing the same subject matter. And I don't think the government has put forward that case, because I think that many of the contextual clues that apply in the nearby statutes also apply in the stop-time rule, or at least there isn't a sufficient reason for construing those statutes differently. So, first of all, I think it's important to recognize that the stop-time rule is applied only in the context of removal proceedings after the immigration judge has just decided whether an alien is inadmissible or removable.

Unikowsky</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question before the Court today is, what does it mean for an offense to render an alien inadmissible for purposes of the stop-time rule? The Court should hold that an offense renders an alien inadmissible if the immigration judge finds that the offense renders the alien inadmissible at the removal hearing that precipitates the need to apply the stop-time rule. If the Court disagrees with that and agrees with the Eleventh Circuit that inadmissible is a status, it should hold that an alien acquires that status when the alien is capable of being charged with inadmissibility. In this case, neither condition is satisfied. Petitioner was not found inadmissible. He wasn't capable of being found inadmissible. Therefore, he was not rendered inadmissible. So I'd like to begin this morning with a concession the government makes at pages 29 and 30 of its brief which I think narrows the issues in this case somewhat. So the government concedes that when the words ""inadmissible"" and ""removable,"" which are the crucial words in the stop-time rule, when those words are used in a statute that has a connection to the alien's own removal proceeding, they're a reference to the charge against the alien at that proceeding. They're not a status. So the government agrees that in those contexts, its proposed interpretation of the words ""inadmissible"" and ""removable"" in the stop-time rule is incorrect. So, in Section 1226, the mandatory detention statute, that says that an alien who is inadmissible by reason of having committed an offense under Section 1182 is subject to mandatory detention, the government agrees there that ""inadmissible"" is a reference to inadmissible at the proceeding, not just the status of being inadmissible. The government says that's natural in that context, and we agree, because that's a statute with the relationship to the alien's removal. Same thing in Section 1252. That's the jurisdiction-stripping statute. That says that courts of appeals don't have jurisdiction to hear petitions for review by an alien who is removable for certain specified reasons. There, too, the government agrees removable is not the status; it's a reference to the actual charge at the hearing, and they say that's natural in that context because the statute has a connection to the alien's removal proceeding. So the question in this case boils down to whether the government has put forward a sufficient case for holding that the words ""inadmissible"" and ""removable"" in the stop-time rule mean something different from what it concedes they mean in these adjacent or nearby statutes addressing the same subject matter. And I don't think the government has put forward that case, because I think that many of the contextual clues that apply in the nearby statutes also apply in the stop-time rule, or at least there isn't a sufficient reason for construing those statutes differently. So, first of all, I think it's important to recognize that the stop-time rule is applied only in the context of removal proceedings after the immigration judge has just decided whether an alien is inadmissible or removable. So there's like two steps. At step one, the immigration judge decides whether an offense renders the alien inadmissible or removable.

The question is whether Petitioner has committed an offense that renders him inadmissible under Section 1182(a)(2). To find the answer, we look to the text of Section 1182(a)(2), and it says that any alien who is convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude is inadmissible. There's no dispute in this case that Petitioner has -- has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. Therefore, he has been -- he has committed an offense that renders him inadmissible under Section 1182(a)(2), and that should be the end of the matter. Now Petitioner says there's an added requirement in the statute, that requirement being that he must be seeking admission. But that requirement can't be found in the text of Section 1182(a)(2). It can't be found in the text of the stop-time rule itself. Rather, the stop-time rule ties the operation of the rule to an alien's status as inadmissible, independent of whether he is seeking admission or not. And in that respect, the stop-time rule operates in the same way as many other provisions of the INA. My friend described some of those provisions as obscure, but I think they're anything but. For example, we cite a number of them on pages 17 to 19 of our brief. One of them is 8 U.S.C. Section 1255(a). This was a major part of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986; 1.7 million aliens applied for relief under this section. And what that section says is that those aliens would be ineligible for relief if they had the status of being inadmissible. And that's so even if those aliens were already admitted and not seeking admission. Moreover, that same section says, if, after being granted amnesty under that provision, those aliens then committed an act that made them inadmissible, that amnesty status would -- would have been terminated. So it works just like the stop-time rule in this case and, indeed, mirrors the operation of that rule. Another example is Section 1160. That's another major part of that same Act. That said that -- that gave special temporary resident status to a certain group of agricultural workers; 1.3 million agricultural workers applied for relief under that section.

And each side is given a different set of rights. Each side is given a different set of burdens. Each side is given a different set of benefits or lack thereof. And I don't see what's illogical to say that what Congress was thinking about is, if you're in removal proceedings, you're eligible for cancellation of removal for those crimes that make you eligible, meaning, if you have to be mandatorily deported, you have to be mandatorily deported.

3141,2019.18-801-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan,"I think this goes back to a question that you got at the very beginning. But setting attorneys' fees aside, could you tell us, Mr. Stewart, exactly what expenses you charge for and exactly what expenses you don't?","<speaker>Malcolm L. Stewart</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: An unsuccessful patent applicant may seek judicial review through either a direct appeal to the Federal Circuit under 35 U.S.C. 141 or a district court suit under Section 145. Section 145 states that an applicant who files suit under that provision must pay all the expenses of the proceeding. The question presented here is whether those expenses include money that the PTO spends to employ lawyers and paralegals who assist with the agency's defense of the suit. For three principal reasons, the answer to that question is yes. First, the term ""expenses"" unambiguously encompasses costs -- encompasses money paid to employees or other personnel to accomplish an -- a particular task. And unlike the term ""costs,"" which has a similarly broad common meaning, this Court has not construed the term ""expenses"" as a legal term of art with a more limited scope. Second, requiring patent applicants who file suit under Section 145 to pay personnel expenses of the PTO is consistent with the overall statutory scheme. Congress has directed the PTO to charge fees that are sufficient to cover its aggregate operating costs, including personnel expenses. And the PTO has developed fee schedules that, in a rough and ready way, require applicants who cause the agency to incur greater expenses to -- to pay more in the way of fees. And Section 145 applicants put the PTO to a particular expenses, and it's therefore consistent with the logic of the statute to require them to pay more. And, third, it's especially appropriate to require Section 145 plaintiffs to pay the PTO's personnel expenses because Section 141 is available as an alternative means of obtaining judicial review. Section 141 is not a cut-rate or a substandard mode of judicial review. It's ordinary, on the record, APA-style judicial review. And it contains no requirement that the -- the applicant who chooses that course must pay the PTO's personnel expenses. And so --</text>",2019

One, a breach of loyalty that they invested in -- in a vehicle that cost more money than was needed, and it was self-dealing, so trust law has always said, you can't self-deal. You can't make money off of the assets of the plan. So whether or not they get something or don't, trust law has been clear forever that that belongs to the trust and the plan participants have trustees who are self-dealing, they're not going to sue for themselves, we can sue for that self-dealing. Secondly, the plan lost 750-odd billion dollars or whatever the money was, millions, in imprudent investment. Now, whether we lose money or not, the plan lost money. It lost $753 million or whatever the figure was. And, in fact, until you contributed 311 million of that 753, the plan was underfunded. You then came along and said: Well, we'll give that much, a part of that loss but not the whole. And so if the trustees are not going to give the whole amount because it's not in their best interests, but it's in the plan's best interests, what does it matter whether the participants get a piece of that or not? The plan gets it and they're representing the plan.

They can't argue that participants have an equitable interest in only some of the trust corpus, because the trust is unsegregated and undivided. So they're forced to take the incredible position, to quote their brief, that defined-benefit plan participants have no interest in plan assets. If Respondents were right, no one would have an equitable interest in any of the trust's assets. But a trust can't exist unless someone holds equitable title to its assets, and that someone here can only be the participants. Second, and independently, my clients have a right to loyal stewardship of their retirement savings. When Respondents engaged in self-dealing, my clients suffered a concrete injury. Under the centuries-old ""no further inquiry"" rule, beneficiaries could sue even when there was no conceivable possibility of a financial loss. The breach itself gives rise to a case or controversy. In any event, and third, my clients have representational standing to vindicate injury to their plan. Since before the founding, when a trustee was unwilling to sue, equity courts allowed beneficiaries to do so on behalf of the trust. And so I'd like to begin with our property injury. A defined-benefit plan under ERISA is a private exchange of services. Workers forgo wages in exchange for a promise of a future payment secured by trust property. This is critical because there is an unsegregated, undivided pool of assets, the trust, that pays the pension of all the beneficiaries.

This Court should reverse for three reasons. First, Section 113 bars Respondents' challenge to EPA's remedy. Second, Section 122 bars Respondents from undertaking any remedial actions absent EPA's authorization.

3832,2019.17-1498-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan,"Well, Ms. Blatt, same kind of question, and maybe it goes to a bunch of your arguments. I mean, look, if I were writing this statute, I would say it all goes to the EPA. It's just -- you know, that's the sensible solution to have one party that makes all the rules in this. But I'm not writing the statute. And the statute has three savings clauses in it, which -- which suggests that the states have a significant role in this. And, in particular, one that says that the states get to impose additional liability or requirements with respect to the release of hazardous substances. And I guess, you know, one way into this is if I -- if -- if -- if we imagine that this was done not with a damages rule, but suppose the Montana legislature just said, you know what, this plan that the EPA has put in place, it requires arsenic at a certain level, and we think it would be better to lower that, and we don't really care that the EPA thinks that that would not be a good idea for health purposes, as well as for economic purposes; we think that that arsenic level should be lowered.

Is that enough to trigger the exception in your case?","<speaker>Eric C. Rassbach</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If separation of church and state means anything at all, it must mean the government cannot interfere with the church's decisions about who is authorized to teach its religion. In this country, it is emphatically not the province of judges, juries, or government officials to decide who ought to teach Catholic fifth graders that Jesus is the son of God or who ought to teach Jewish preschoolers what it means to say: Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God, the Lord is one. And at bottom, that is what these cases are about: who controls who teaches the faith to schoolchildren. Under Hosanna-Tabor, the answer is easy. Churches must choose those who ""teach their faith."" Indeed, that is one of the most important religious functions for any religious community, passing the faith on to the next generation. And since the teachers here were the churches' primary agents for teaching the Catholic faith to fifth graders, teaching them for hours a week, much more than parish priests, they fall within the ministerial exception immunity. Respondents would have the Court ignore all that, substituting a formalistic standard that relies first and foremost on the employees' title to determine whether the ministerial exception applies. That would wrongly elevate form over function and force judges to decide what titles sound religious enough to qualify, and it would hopelessly entangle church and state. Unsurprisingly, no court has ever adopted Respondents' title test. If Respondent's arguments give some members of the Court déjà vu all over again, that is because Respondents have recycled many of the arguments the Court unanimously rejected eight years ago in Hosanna-Tabor. The pretext inquiry, the notice requirement, the idea that freedom of association makes freedom of religion entirely unnecessary all were raised in Hosanna-Tabor and rejected unanimously. Eight years later, Respondents' arguments are not any more convincing. In short, there's no reason for government to get in the business of teaching religion.

4151,2019.19-267-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, there's a difference between a teacher who teaches a religion class in a secular school and a teacher who teaches religion in a religious school, but I'm not sure what the difference is, meaning, can you point me to anything in the evidence that the teacher here was acting any differently working from a workbook for her religious class than a teacher does in a secular school? That's my first question. My second question is, I think what's being confused here is that you're asking for an exception to law that's broader than the ministerial exception generally and broader than is necessary to protect the church. The two teachers at issue here are not claiming that they were fired because the school thought they were teaching religion wrong. One says she was fired because she came down with cancer and was fired for a medical condition. The other claims it was because of age. She had been there for many, many years and had been very acceptable to the school, and all of a sudden, she reaches a certain age and she's fired. So you're asking for an exception to the Family and Medical Leave Act, to wage and hourly laws, to all sorts of laws, including breach of contract because at least one of the schools here, contract with the teacher says they won't discriminate because of the teacher's age or disability. So you're asking for something broader than giving the -- the schools the power to hire or fire certain kinds of people because of how they teach the religion or don't teach it, and you haven't explained to me why it's necessary.","<speaker>Eric C.

And even when some deference is given to a religious organization in a qualified immunity sort of way or otherwise, you're still asking us to make a judgment between who qualifies as a minister and who does not on the basis of our judgment that their activity with respect to a religion is de minimis. And I -- I'm just wondering, does that pose some problems for you and for your clients in some of these cases?

In this country, it is emphatically not the province of judges, juries, or government officials to decide who ought to teach Catholic fifth graders that Jesus is the son of God or who ought to teach Jewish preschoolers what it means to say: Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God, the Lord is one. And at bottom, that is what these cases are about: who controls who teaches the faith to schoolchildren. Under Hosanna-Tabor, the answer is easy. Churches must choose those who ""teach their faith."" Indeed, that is one of the most important religious functions for any religious community, passing the faith on to the next generation. And since the teachers here were the churches' primary agents for teaching the Catholic faith to fifth graders, teaching them for hours a week, much more than parish priests, they fall within the ministerial exception immunity. Respondents would have the Court ignore all that, substituting a formalistic standard that relies first and foremost on the employees' title to determine whether the ministerial exception applies. That would wrongly elevate form over function and force judges to decide what titles sound religious enough to qualify, and it would hopelessly entangle church and state. Unsurprisingly, no court has ever adopted Respondents' title test. If Respondent's arguments give some members of the Court déjà vu all over again, that is because Respondents have recycled many of the arguments the Court unanimously rejected eight years ago in Hosanna-Tabor. The pretext inquiry, the notice requirement, the idea that freedom of association makes freedom of religion entirely unnecessary all were raised in Hosanna-Tabor and rejected unanimously. Eight years later, Respondents' arguments are not any more convincing. In short, there's no reason for government to get in the business of teaching religion. The Ninth Circuit should be reversed.</text>",2019

First, the text, structure, and context of the securities laws offer a straightforward route to reversal. Congress has created for SEC court actions a tiered system of civil money penalties that does not include disgorgement. Congress has also given the SEC authority for an order requiring accounting and disgorgement, using those very words, in an -- in an administrative proceeding but no similar authority for court actions. And Congress has given other agencies clear textual authority for judicial disgorgement orders. Using traditional tools of statutory construction, the result is clear: The SEC can seek the authorized penalties but no others. Second, the statute's allowance for equitable relief does not help the SEC because penalties are not equitable relief. That has been the law for centuries. There is no principal distinction between the characteristics that make SEC disgorgement a penalty under Kokesh and those that make it a penalty under the old equity rule. Its purpose is to punish disobedience of a public law. Any return of money or property to those injured by the violation is discretionary at best and often never happens. Third, the phrase ""equitable relief,"" enacted as part of Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002, did not ratify circuit court cases that had approved SEC disgorgement. Those cases, beginning with Texas Gulf Sulphur, did not look to statutory text. They certainly did not settle the meaning of text that did not even exist yet. Instead, we have here only congressional silence, and silence does not give an agency any authority to act, much less the authority to punish.</text>",2019

Stewart</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin by discussing the significance of Kokesh, and, as some of the questions have illuminated, the Court in Kokesh said that SE -- disgorgement in SEC cases was a penalty for purposes of a statute of limitations provision. There's no reason to read the decision more broadly. And, in particular, the three reasons that the Court gave for concluding that it was a penalty for these purposes don't -- they can't map onto the criteria for determining whether something is equitable relief. The three characteristics that the Court identified were it's imposed as a consequence of violating a public law, it serves a deterrent purpose, and it's not compensatory. And I'd say first that all three of those characteristics were present in Kansas versus Nebraska, in which this Court, sitting as a court of original jurisdiction, ordered disgorgement in an interstate compact case. And in that case, the Court emphasized that when the interstate compact was ratified by Congress, it took on the character of a public law. And the Court said the equitable power of a court of equity is all the greater when the public interest is concerned. Second, the disgorgement remedy in that case was intended only to serve deterrent purposes. That was the whole justification for the remedy, because, due to the fairly idiosyncratic economic circumstances of the parties, the special master concluded and the Court agreed that a compensatory damages remedy would not be sufficient to deter future violations. And so compensatory damages were awarded, but the Court ordered disgorge -- partial disgorgement on top of that in order to ensure that there would be an adequate deterrent. And for the same reason, the third characteristic that the Court identified in Kokesh, namely, that disgorgement in SEC cases is not compensatory, was true in Kansas versus Nebraska as well. The disgorgement remedy was ordered on top of the compensatory damages award. That was deemed adequate to compensate Kansas for its losses. I'd like to turn next to the issue that was taking up the discussion towards the end of Mr. Rapawy's argument, which is the formula by which the SEC urges that disgorgement be calculated and courts ordinarily calculate disgorgement in -- in fraud cases. The Court in Kokesh cited the third restatement of restitution and unjust enrichment for the general rule that net profits are the measure of disgorgement and that the defendant is entitled to deduct its marginal costs. Now the term ""general rule"" implies that there will be exceptions. And if you look at literally the next page of the restatement from the one that the Court cited, the restatement says the defendant will not be allowed a deduction for the direct expenses of an attempt to defraud the claimant. And so, for example, if part of your expenditures are, as Justice Breyer were -- was hypothesizing, if part of your expenditures are sending out fraudulent communications, false sales pitches that are intended to deceive consumers in to -- to buying securities, that would be the kind of expense that under traditional equitable expenses -- under traditional equitable principles would not be allowed. A second example. In Foreign Corrupt Practices cases -- Act cases, the wrong is that the defendant company has obtained a contract by paying a bribe to the public official, and the SEC would say, in those cases, the proper measure of disgorgement is net profits earned on the contract. And so the defendant wouldn't be charged gross receipts. The defendant would be allowed to deduct its operating expenses, but we wouldn't allow the defendant to count the bribe itself as a cost of doing business, as a deductible expense. That, in our view, wouldn't be allowed in computing the amount of disgorgement that would be ordered. So the one thing that I would emphasize most strongly is we are not -- as to measure of disgorgement, we are not asking for an SEC-specific rule. We believe that the arguments we've made in prior cases have been consistent with traditional equitable principles because, even though the general rule is that you use net profits as the measure, that is subject to exceptions. And we rely on the exceptions in a variety of circumstances. The second point I would make is, if we're wrong, if in some instance or instances or in some category of cases courts have been awarding disgorgement in an amount that exceeds what traditional equitable principles would produce, then the correct answer is not to give us everything and it's not to give us nothing. It's that courts should continue to order disgorgement but compute it in accordance with traditional general equitable rules, not in accordance with any SEC-specific formula.</text>",2019

And in that case, the Court emphasized that when the interstate compact was ratified by Congress, it took on the character of a public law. And the Court said the equitable power of a court of equity is all the greater when the public interest is concerned. Second, the disgorgement remedy in that case was intended only to serve deterrent purposes. That was the whole justification for the remedy, because, due to the fairly idiosyncratic economic circumstances of the parties, the special master concluded and the Court agreed that a compensatory damages remedy would not be sufficient to deter future violations. And so compensatory damages were awarded, but the Court ordered disgorge -- partial disgorgement on top of that in order to ensure that there would be an adequate deterrent. And for the same reason, the third characteristic that the Court identified in Kokesh, namely, that disgorgement in SEC cases is not compensatory, was true in Kansas versus Nebraska as well. The disgorgement remedy was ordered on top of the compensatory damages award. That was deemed adequate to compensate Kansas for its losses. I'd like to turn next to the issue that was taking up the discussion towards the end of Mr. Rapawy's argument, which is the formula by which the SEC urges that disgorgement be calculated and courts ordinarily calculate disgorgement in -- in fraud cases. The Court in Kokesh cited the third restatement of restitution and unjust enrichment for the general rule that net profits are the measure of disgorgement and that the defendant is entitled to deduct its marginal costs. Now the term ""general rule"" implies that there will be exceptions. And if you look at literally the next page of the restatement from the one that the Court cited, the restatement says the defendant will not be allowed a deduction for the direct expenses of an attempt to defraud the claimant. And so, for example, if part of your expenditures are, as Justice Breyer were -- was hypothesizing, if part of your expenditures are sending out fraudulent communications, false sales pitches that are intended to deceive consumers in to -- to buying securities, that would be the kind of expense that under traditional equitable expenses -- under traditional equitable principles would not be allowed. A second example. In Foreign Corrupt Practices cases -- Act cases, the wrong is that the defendant company has obtained a contract by paying a bribe to the public official, and the SEC would say, in those cases, the proper measure of disgorgement is net profits earned on the contract. And so the defendant wouldn't be charged gross receipts. The defendant would be allowed to deduct its operating expenses, but we wouldn't allow the defendant to count the bribe itself as a cost of doing business, as a deductible expense. That, in our view, wouldn't be allowed in computing the amount of disgorgement that would be ordered. So the one thing that I would emphasize most strongly is we are not -- as to measure of disgorgement, we are not asking for an SEC-specific rule. We believe that the arguments we've made in prior cases have been consistent with traditional equitable principles because, even though the general rule is that you use net profits as the measure, that is subject to exceptions. And we rely on the exceptions in a variety of circumstances. The second point I would make is, if we're wrong, if in some instance or instances or in some category of cases courts have been awarding disgorgement in an amount that exceeds what traditional equitable principles would produce, then the correct answer is not to give us everything and it's not to give us nothing. It's that courts should continue to order disgorgement but compute it in accordance with traditional general equitable rules, not in accordance with any SEC-specific formula.</text>",2019

Do you think equity would sustain an award for innocent or good-faith infringement without a more culpable state of mind? Because there's a wide swath of behavior between truly innocent, truly good faith, and willful. There could be reckless. There could be callous disregard. Would equity consonance an award for negligence or good faith?","<speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Lanham Act authorizes courts to remedy trademark violations by awarding infringers profits subject to the principles of equity. The question presented here is whether the -- this phrase ""principles of equity"" requires trademark owners to prove willfulness as an absolute precondition to profit awards. The answer is no for three reasons: First, the phrase ""principles of equity"" signifies a multifactor analysis where no one factor is controlling. Second, the phrase -- excuse me. The statutory text and structure supersede any settled willfulness requirement. And, third, there was no such settled background willfulness requirement. First, the phrase ""principles of equity"" refers to the familiar equitable principles that courts have long applied in determining whether to award profits in trademark cases. A defendant's culpability is a weighty factor, but it should not be controlling. Other traditional equitable factors are also important to further the landmark -- the Lanham Act's purposes to protect consumers and trademark owners' goodwill. Such traditional factors include whether other relief adequately compensates the plaintiff and whether the defendant is enriched by his violation of law. And these factors can all exist along a spectrum. For instance, culpability can range from fraudulent to innocent and everything in between, including callous disregard and negligence. So in a case where a defendant is completely innocent, courts should require a greater showing of other factors before awarding profits. Conversely, greater culpability justifies a profit award that deters future infringement. And courts can be trusted to use their discretion to balance the equities for the cases in between. The statute also requires the amount of any award to be compensatory and not a penalty, and just, according to the circumstances. Second, even assuming a settled willfulness requirement before the Lanham Act, the statutory text and structure reflect a congressional intent to supersede it. From the Act's inception, i.e., from 1946, Congress has expressly distinguished and protected defendants and which defendants from awards of monetary relief based on a heightened mental state. Today the Lanham Act contains eight provisions tying monetary relief to a heightened mental state. That's -- that's a lot of provisions. The provision that dictates monetary relief, Section 117(a), is the provision that controls this case. That case -- that provision, excuse me, requires a willful violation for trademark dilution under 1125(c), but no such mental state requirement appears for infringement violations under Section 1125(a) or any other cause of action under the Lanham Act. We think the inference is particularly strong that the omission of a willfulness requirement is intentional. The same Congress in 1999 that amended the statute to add a willfulness requirement for trademark dilution cases under subsection (c) affirmatively distinguished this type of infringement case under subsection (a) because the amendment simultaneously struck out the word ""violation"" of Sections 1125(a) and then reinserted that same phrase, violation of subsection (a), and then added a willful infringement --</text>",2019

The government suggests that there is no such thing as an enforceable congressional promise and that even the clearest command to pay money is subject to a caveat that it's subject to appropriations, and reliance, even on clear language, is ""inherently unreasonable."" That position is inconsistent with all this Court's cases, including the ones that go the government's way by finding an implied repeal for, in the government's view, there is nothing to repeal. Simply failing to appropriate the money cancels the obligation. The government's position would also make it impossible to accomplish many important government objectives that require a clear and enforceable promise to pay, as this case well illustrates. When Congress made the health benefit exchanges a centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act, it faced a problem. The exchanges depended on the participant of private health insurance companies, and those companies were being asked to insure previously uninsured people on unprecedented terms. The natural reaction of the insurers would have been to charge a substantial premium to account for the uncertainties, but that premium would have worked against the government in two fundamental ways. First, it would have made the policies relatively unaffordable, contrary to the whole purpose of the Affordable Care Act; and, second, the government would have ended up paying for those heightened premiums through tax subsidies. So the risk corridor programs at issue here was an important component of the government's solution to the problem. The program depended on a clear and enforceable promise that the government would pay for a portion of any losses incurred by the health insurance companies that stepped forward. In order for that promise to work, it had to be clear and enforceable. If the government had simply said we will make these risk corridor payments subject to appropriations, the promise would have made no difference whatsoever. If all the insurance companies were doing was trading the uncertainties about the risk pool for the uncertainties over the funding priorities of future Congresses, they would have gained nothing in the process. So Congress made a clear money-mandating promise to pay. Based on that promise, my clients and others got state-approved rates to offer policies on the exchanges. After those rates were already set, then HHS adopted its so-called transitional policy, which kept some healthy people off the exchanges and, as the government itself recognized, meant that more insurers would lose more money. But HHS said to the insurers: Don't worry, we have the risk corridors program in place, and we will cover some of those excess losses as a result of the transitional policy. So the policies went forward and losses were incurred, and when it became time to pay, the government then started pointing to some ambiguous appropriations riders.

The government suggests that there is no such thing as an enforceable congressional promise and that even the clearest command to pay money is subject to a caveat that it's subject to appropriations, and reliance, even on clear language, is ""inherently unreasonable."" That position is inconsistent with all this Court's cases, including the ones that go the government's way by finding an implied repeal for, in the government's view, there is nothing to repeal. Simply failing to appropriate the money cancels the obligation. The government's position would also make it impossible to accomplish many important government objectives that require a clear and enforceable promise to pay, as this case well illustrates. When Congress made the health benefit exchanges a centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act, it faced a problem. The exchanges depended on the participant of private health insurance companies, and those companies were being asked to insure previously uninsured people on unprecedented terms. The natural reaction of the insurers would have been to charge a substantial premium to account for the uncertainties, but that premium would have worked against the government in two fundamental ways. First, it would have made the policies relatively unaffordable, contrary to the whole purpose of the Affordable Care Act; and, second, the government would have ended up paying for those heightened premiums through tax subsidies. So the risk corridor programs at issue here was an important component of the government's solution to the problem. The program depended on a clear and enforceable promise that the government would pay for a portion of any losses incurred by the health insurance companies that stepped forward. In order for that promise to work, it had to be clear and enforceable. If the government had simply said we will make these risk corridor payments subject to appropriations, the promise would have made no difference whatsoever. If all the insurance companies were doing was trading the uncertainties about the risk pool for the uncertainties over the funding priorities of future Congresses, they would have gained nothing in the process. So Congress made a clear money-mandating promise to pay. Based on that promise, my clients and others got state-approved rates to offer policies on the exchanges. After those rates were already set, then HHS adopted its so-called transitional policy, which kept some healthy people off the exchanges and, as the government itself recognized, meant that more insurers would lose more money. But HHS said to the insurers: Don't worry, we have the risk corridors program in place, and we will cover some of those excess losses as a result of the transitional policy. So the policies went forward and losses were incurred, and when it became time to pay, the government then started pointing to some ambiguous appropriations riders. But those riders by their plain terms did not repeal the obligations of 1342 or even say prospectively that we're going to limit the payments out to the extent of payments in.</text>",2019

This theory turns the integrity of every official action at every level of government into a potential federal fraud investigation. It end-runs McNally and Skilling by subsuming honest services fraud within property fraud and by criminalizing ulterior motives even without bribes or kickbacks. It would effect a sweeping expansion of federal criminal jurisdiction into a particularly fraught area. This is not the law. This Court in Cleveland held that regulatory authority is not property. So an official who induces a sovereign decision through deceit has not obtained property by fraud.

Kavanaugh,"I want to see your reaction to this way to think about the case, maybe picking up on Justice Breyer's question and -- and Justice Gorsuch's first question. As a number of my colleagues have pointed out, Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, Alito, Breyer and others, there are very strong interests on both sides here, which is what makes the case difficult, obviously. There's religious liberty for the Little Sisters of the Poor and others. There's the interest in ensuring women's access to healthcare and preventive services, which is also a critical interest. So the question becomes, who decides? Who decides how to balance those interests? And the answer, of course, is Congress in the first interest -- instance. And -- and RFRA provides a backstop on that, but even beyond RFRA, in the ACA, Congress has delegated to the agency. Okay, so we have a delegation from Congress to the agency, and -- which is common, and sometimes Congress delegates narrowly with narrow language, and sometimes it delegates broadly. And the rule of thumb I've always thought is courts should construe narrow language narrowly and broad language broadly. And this seems to be broad language, as Justice Thomas noted. And when you have that kind of broad language, you're going to get different executive branches who are going to exercise their discretion within that broad language and balance the interests differently. And then the question is, what's the judicial role? And it seems to me the judicial role is not to put limits on the agency discretion that Congress has not put there. And then we're left, I think, as Justice Breyer said, with -- and -- and I want to get your reaction to this -- with the arbitrary and capricious test at the end of the day and just making sure that in exercising its discretion and balancing those interests, the agency didn't go outside the limits of reasonableness, which is a very deferential test. It's not abdication, but it's deferential. Why isn't that the way to look at the case, and if we get down to the bottom line of is this reasonable, not maybe everyone's preferred choice but at least within the bounds of reasonable, why isn't this a reasonable way to balance it?

If -- if you posit a lower-level decision-maker who's either a monster or an idiot, then, of course, you're always going to think that there's a case for judicial review. Whenever judicial review is cut off, you open up the possibility that there's going to be a decision that would otherwise be reviewed that seems really, really wrong. So you have to -- you have to make the argument that this is what Congress wanted. And why would they have wanted that in this situation?","<speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress used the words ""questions of law"" in Section 1252(a)(2)(D), it meant questions of law only, not questions of fact and not mixed questions of law and fact. We know that from the text of the provision itself, which doesn't mention questions of fact or mixed questions. But we also know it from the context in which Congress enacted the provision. In St. Cyr, this Court held that denying criminal aliens a judicial forum for pure questions of law would raise constitutional doubts. When Congress enacted this provision following St. Cyr, it wanted to provide criminal aliens enough judicial review to avoid those doubts but no more. Questions of law thus refers to the same questions identified in this Court's decision in St. Cyr, pure questions of law. Now Petitioners would read ""questions of law"" to extend far beyond purely legal questions to encompass every mixed question of law and fact. But mixed questions aren't mentioned in the text of Section 1252(a)(2)(D), they're not mentioned anywhere in St. Cyr either, and construing questions of law to encompass every mixed question would all but undo Congress's efforts to limit the scope of judicial review in cases involving criminal aliens. Remember it's been Congress's goal since 1996 to streamline and expedite the removal of criminal aliens. And yet, under Petitioners' reading, criminal and non-criminal aliens alike would get judicial review of all constitutional claims, of all questions of law, and of all mixed questions. The only difference in the judicial review that they would get would be limited to the category of questions of fact, as some of the justices this morning have already noted. That difference would be this: whereas in criminal -- cases involving criminal aliens, the Board's factual findings would be conclusive; whereas in cases involving non-criminal aliens, the Board's factual findings would be conclusive unless not supported by substantial evidence.

But, as this Court indicated in Powell, nearly 50 years ago, nothing would be less fruitful than for this Court to select a rigid rule of constitutional law of insanity. And that admonition rings as true today as it did 50 years ago. The first thing I'd like to talk about is that it's not deeply rooted. The right versus wrong test is a relatively recent vintage. The historical basis for it started somewhere around the 1800s; and, therefore, it's not deeply rooted. In addition, the states have had historical and traditional discretion to both define the elements of the criminal law, the defenses that are available in those criminal justice proceedings, and the substantive rules at which those defenses and elements are met. And consistent with that discretion, the State of Kansas has a holistic approach to the mental illness problem starting at the time the criminal justice proceeding is initiated, throughout the guilt phase, as well as in the punishment phase, and continuing on even with regard to the sentence as it's carried out, whether being in a prison or in a mental hospital. These factors confirm that Petitioner has not carried the heavy burden to identify a single rule that is clearly established and required by the fundamental elements of due process. And for that reason, we believe that the state supreme court judgment in Kansas should be affirmed. And so unless there are additional questions this Court would have, I'd -- I'd like to first turn to the answer of Justice Alito's question, and the answer is the right-and-wrong test has multiple components. There is no consistent element or definition of how that's applied in any of the 46 jurisdictions. As our brief points out, there are a host of different factions and different ways in which those elements would be met, and we think that, in and of itself, undermines the constitutional floor that Petitioner seeks --</text>",2019

But Kansas scrubs moral capacity from its criminal law and runs afoul of the Fourteenth and the Eighth Amendments.

As such, Kansas uproots the deeply rooted by eliminating any mechanism to assess whether a defendant's capacity for moral judgment was intact or was irretrievably compromised by mental illness.

Blatt</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about how to tell the difference between descriptive names the Lanham Act protects and generic ones the Act does not. There are three reasons this Court should hold that the answer is the primary significance test, that is, whether consumers primarily think the name is a genus or a potential brand. First, the Act mandates this test. Second, the Act abrogated Goodyear. And, third, this test furthers the statutory purpose to let consumers decide which marks deserve trademark protection. First, the text. The Act has always required, in Sections 1052, 1091, and 1127, trademark registration if a mark helps consumers distinguish among brands. In other words, the Act protects descriptive names, which consumers find useful, but it excludes generic ones, which consumers think just refer to a genus. The Lanham Act thus codified the law of unfair competition, which had protected descriptive but not generic names. And right before Congress passed the Act, this Court in Kellogg adopted the primary significance test under unfair competition law to distinguish between generic and descriptive names. For the past 70 years, courts have embraced this primary significance test to tell the difference under the Lanham Act. And it was against this universal backdrop that Congress later codified the primary significance test in Section 1064 to overrule a decision departing from this test in the cancellation context; 1064 thus reflects Congress's ratification of the primary significance test to define a generic name in all contexts. The government has no other test for the dividing line other than primary significance. Second, Goodyear did not survive the Lanham Act. The Act repudiates, root to branch, any per se rule that an island of words are generic as a matter of law regardless of consumers' views. First, Sections 1052, 1091, and 1127 necessarily define generic names as ones that do not help consumers distinguish among brands, because everything else must be registered.

The state's only defense in -- in support of the judgment below is that the Sixth Amendment does not require unanimity at all; that is, not in state courts or in federal courts. This Court should reject that argument. As the Court has said many times over many decades, the Sixth Amendment requires a unanimous verdict to convict. In particular, what the Court has said is that the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury carries with it the essentials of the common law.

The state talks about the fact that many states at the time had trial by jury provisions in their own constitutions and correctly notes that some of those provisions explicitly required unanimity but some of them didn't.

The state talks about the fact that many states at the time had trial by jury provisions in their own constitutions and correctly notes that some of those provisions explicitly required unanimity but some of them didn't.

Then we get to the Apodaca question. It seems to me there are two practical arguments for overruling Apodaca if you accept that's holding. One is, as Justice Gorsuch says, there are defendants who have been convicted and sentenced to life, 10-2 or 11-1, who otherwise would have not been convicted. So that seems like a serious issue for us to think about in terms of overruling. And the second is that the rule in question here is rooted in a -- in racism, you know, rooted in a desire, apparently, to diminish the voices of black jurors in the late 1890s. So do either of those two -- and that doesn't go to the Sixth Amendment. That goes to the stare decisis angle.

So let's imagine this case is decided in your favor, and then a -- a defendant who has been convicted by a non-unanimous verdict in Puerto Rico comes here and he says, look, I am a citizen of the United States, and the only reason why I was able to be convicted by a non-unanimous verdict is -- are these old Insular Cases that reflect attitudes of the day in the -- in the end of the -- after the -- the aftermath of the Spanish American War, and just as you brushed aside Apodaca, you should brush aside the Insular Cases.","<speaker>Jeffrey L. Fisher</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Last term in Timbs against Indiana, this Court reaffirmed the well-settled rule that incorporated provisions of the Bill of Rights apply the same way to the states as they apply to the federal government. Taking that rule as the given, the state does not defend Justice Powell's pivotal vote in the Apodaca case. And, indeed, that reasoning flouted precedent at the time and has since been relegated to nothing more than an isolated relic of an abandoned doctrine. The state's only defense in -- in support of the judgment below is that the Sixth Amendment does not require unanimity at all; that is, not in state courts or in federal courts. This Court should reject that argument. As the Court has said many times over many decades, the Sixth Amendment requires a unanimous verdict to convict. In particular, what the Court has said is that the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury carries with it the essentials of the common law. And the common law authorities are uniform, explicit, and absolute. Unanimity is an absolute requirement to trial by jury. And the reasons that the common law commentators gave for that rule are the -- are -- resonate just as powerfully now as they did then. In a nutshell, we are not prepared to take away someone's liberty unless a cross-section of the community uniformly agrees that criminal punishment is appropriate. Now, I don't think the state disputes that historical account that I just gave you or even that unanimity is central to the proper functioning of the jury trial right. Instead, what the state says are two primary things: First, that the drafting history of the Sixth Amendment suggests that the framers meant to dispense with that historical rule, and, second, that that historical requirement of unanimity is no more important than the 12-person rule, which this Court said is not part of the Sixth Amendment, in Williams. So let me turn to those two arguments. Let me start with the drafting history. And we think for three reasons the state has over-read the drafting history. First, as the Court itself said in cases dealing with provisions like the Second Amendment and the Double Jeopardy Clause, we do not read into a deletion of language any meaning when there's no contemporary evidence that it was designed to change the meaning of the provision. And that's all the more true here because of the contextual backdrop. The state talks about the fact that many states at the time had trial by jury provisions in their own constitutions and correctly notes that some of those provisions explicitly required unanimity but some of them didn't. And the rule was the same across all of those states, so the thing that the framers would have taken from the context at the time would have been that it doesn't matter whether you have unanimity in the provision; it requires it either way.</text>",2019

What's -- what's your answer to that?","<speaker>Noel J. Francisco</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The federal sector ADEA adopts the same causation standard applicable to state and local governments and private companies, but-for causation. Three basic points make this clear. First, Section 633 -- 633a prohibits the Federal Government from making a personnel action based on age. But you don't make a personnel action based on age if you make the same decision that you would have made for a similarly situated younger person since any consideration of age has not affected the decision that you have made. At the very least, as in Gross and Nassar, nothing in 633a clearly overrides the common law default rule of but-for causation. Second, Congress easily could have overridden the common law default rule if it wanted to. It could have applied the motivating factor standard to the ADEA, or it could have gone further and prohibited any consideration of age no matter how fleeting. But it didn't do that. Instead, it adopted language that this Court has interpreted as incorporating the common law default rule. Finally, our rule makes perfect sense. There's no reason why Congress would have created a lower causation standard for the Federal Government than for state and local governments. After all, there's no evidence that Congress was more concerned about discrimination by the Federal Government. That's why Senator Bentsen, Section 633a's principal sponsor, said that under 633a, ""government employees will be subject to the same protections against arbitrary employment based on age as are employees in the private sector."" Now, we've had some discussion about the Civil Service Reform Act, and I actually think it's very instructive here to the interpretive question. I'd like to point out two specific provisions in that, I think, that are relevant. The first one actually isn't in our briefs, so I'm going to take a minute here to describe it because it's a provision of the CSRA that specifically cross-references, incorporates, and describes Section 633a in the text of the statute. And what you'll see in that provision is that it uses language to describe 633a that is parallel to the language that you find in the private sector provisions. So I think it underscores that these are just different ways of seeing the same thing. And I'm referring to 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1)(B), and here's what it says: ""Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority, discriminate for or against any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of age, as prohibited under 633a."" So it doesn't have any of the language that my friends on the other side rely on. Textually, this is a statute that Congress has enacted that in its text is describing 633a and it uses language that's parallel to the private sector provisions. And I think it's highly relevant to interpreting 633a because as Justice Scalia explained is in -- in his opinion in Branch against Smith, it is ""of course the most rudimentary rule of statutory construction, that courts do not interpret statutes in isolation but in the context of the corpus juris of which they are a part, including later enacted statutes.""</text>",2019

At the very least, as in Gross and Nassar, nothing in 633a clearly overrides the common law default rule of but-for causation. Second, Congress easily could have overridden the common law default rule if it wanted to. It could have applied the motivating factor standard to the ADEA, or it could have gone further and prohibited any consideration of age no matter how fleeting. But it didn't do that. Instead, it adopted language that this Court has interpreted as incorporating the common law default rule. Finally, our rule makes perfect sense. There's no reason why Congress would have created a lower causation standard for the Federal Government than for state and local governments. After all, there's no evidence that Congress was more concerned about discrimination by the Federal Government. That's why Senator Bentsen, Section 633a's principal sponsor, said that under 633a, ""government employees will be subject to the same protections against arbitrary employment based on age as are employees in the private sector."" Now, we've had some discussion about the Civil Service Reform Act, and I actually think it's very instructive here to the interpretive question. I'd like to point out two specific provisions in that, I think, that are relevant. The first one actually isn't in our briefs, so I'm going to take a minute here to describe it because it's a provision of the CSRA that specifically cross-references, incorporates, and describes Section 633a in the text of the statute. And what you'll see in that provision is that it uses language to describe 633a that is parallel to the language that you find in the private sector provisions. So I think it underscores that these are just different ways of seeing the same thing. And I'm referring to 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1)(B), and here's what it says: ""Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority, discriminate for or against any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of age, as prohibited under 633a."" So it doesn't have any of the language that my friends on the other side rely on. Textually, this is a statute that Congress has enacted that in its text is describing 633a and it uses language that's parallel to the private sector provisions. And I think it's highly relevant to interpreting 633a because as Justice Scalia explained is in -- in his opinion in Branch against Smith, it is ""of course the most rudimentary rule of statutory construction, that courts do not interpret statutes in isolation but in the context of the corpus juris of which they are a part, including later enacted statutes.""</text>",2019

What regulations are there in place that do?,"<speaker>Malcolm L. Stewart</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The first point I'd like to make about the -- the definition of discharge of a pollutant is that the combination of the words ""to"" and ""from"" import more than either term in isolation; that the statute defines the term ""discharge of a pollutant"" to mean any addition of a pollutant to navigable waters or to the ocean from a point source. And, for example, if at my home I pour whiskey from a bottle into a flask and then I bring the flask to a party at a different location and I pour whiskey into the punch bowl there, nobody would say that I had added whiskey to the punch from the bottle. It would be true that the punch -- that the whiskey originated in the bottle, its route was fairly traceable from the bottle to the punch bowl, and it wound up in the punch bowl, but you wouldn't say it was added to the punch from the bottle. Now, at the other extreme, if I brought the bottle to the party and I poured it, the whiskey from a few inches above the surface of the punch and so it traveled through air or if it traveled through a funnel so it passed over a solid surface, in ordinary parlance, we wouldn't say that simply because there was some spatial gap between the bottle and the punch, therefore, I didn't add it from the -- the bottle to -- to the punch. In between those two extremes, I don't think that the ""to"" and ""from"" will get you all the way home. I think the Court needs to look at other provisions of the Clean Water Act to determine what sort of break in the chain will cause the -- the -- the release no longer to be a discharge from the point source to the navigable waters. But the fairly traceable test that the Ninth Circuit adopted just can't be right. It would encompass -- you know, if transmuted over to the whiskey example, it would encompass situations where I poured the whiskey from the bottle into the flask. Nobody would treat that as addition of the whiskey to the punch from the bottle. Now, with respect to groundwater in particular, the reason that EPA has concluded that groundwater in particular will break the causal chain so that it will no longer be an addition from the point source to the navigable water, groundwater is really treated in the Clean Water Act as its own thing, and in large part, that's because of its distinct physical characteristics, but there's a body of both state and federal law that regulates groundwater specifically, in part to protect the drinking water supply because groundwater is obviously important for that, in part because of potential downstream effects on the quality of navigable waters.</text>",2019

Now, at the other extreme, if I brought the bottle to the party and I poured it, the whiskey from a few inches above the surface of the punch and so it traveled through air or if it traveled through a funnel so it passed over a solid surface, in ordinary parlance, we wouldn't say that simply because there was some spatial gap between the bottle and the punch, therefore, I didn't add it from the -- the bottle to -- to the punch. In between those two extremes, I don't think that the ""to"" and ""from"" will get you all the way home. I think the Court needs to look at other provisions of the Clean Water Act to determine what sort of break in the chain will cause the -- the -- the release no longer to be a discharge from the point source to the navigable waters. But the fairly traceable test that the Ninth Circuit adopted just can't be right. It would encompass -- you know, if transmuted over to the whiskey example, it would encompass situations where I poured the whiskey from the bottle into the flask. Nobody would treat that as addition of the whiskey to the punch from the bottle. Now, with respect to groundwater in particular, the reason that EPA has concluded that groundwater in particular will break the causal chain so that it will no longer be an addition from the point source to the navigable water, groundwater is really treated in the Clean Water Act as its own thing, and in large part, that's because of its distinct physical characteristics, but there's a body of both state and federal law that regulates groundwater specifically, in part to protect the drinking water supply because groundwater is obviously important for that, in part because of potential downstream effects on the quality of navigable waters.</text>",2019

Do you disagree with that statement?","<speaker>Toby J. Heytens</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Fifteen years ago, Lee Malvo was tried, convicted, and sentenced for his role in the D.C. sniper attacks.

But Miller's rule does not cover Malvo's case, and the lower courts erred in holding otherwise. I'd like to make three points, one about Miller, one about Montgomery, and one about why this matters. First, if Miller's holding isn't concerned with mandatory sentences, much of this Court's language in Miller makes very little sense. Miller repeatedly stated its own holding in terms of mandatory sentences, and the Court's analysis specifically distinguished between mandatory and non-mandatory states. Second, Montgomery must be interpreted both in light of Miller and in light of the facts that were before the Court. All of the defendants before the Court in both Miller and Montgomery had received mandatory sentences, and this Court should not lightly interpret a decision about retroactivity as having retroactively announced a new rule governing non-mandatory sentences. Finally, the reason why habeas is so formal and restrictive is because habeas is extraordinarily costly. Malvo's victims were already required to endure one full trial and sentencing hearing more than a decade ago, and the Court should not lightly ask them to go through another, particularly given that the original sentencing fully complied with then controlling constitutional restrictions. I waive the remainder of my two minutes. So turning to the first point about Miller, I -- I think it's just extremely hard, as Malvo's brief now clarifies, that he only sought habeas relief based on Miller. And if you look at Malvo's original habeas petition -- it's on page 80, I believe, page 80 of the petition appendix -- he doesn't just say that he's seeking relief based on Miller; he says he's seeking relief based on Miller's holding that mandatory life without parole violates the Eighth Amendment.

Malvo's victims were already required to endure one full trial and sentencing hearing more than a decade ago, and the Court should not lightly ask them to go through another, particularly given that the original sentencing fully complied with then controlling constitutional restrictions. I waive the remainder of my two minutes. So turning to the first point about Miller, I -- I think it's just extremely hard, as Malvo's brief now clarifies, that he only sought habeas relief based on Miller. And if you look at Malvo's original habeas petition -- it's on page 80, I believe, page 80 of the petition appendix -- he doesn't just say that he's seeking relief based on Miller; he says he's seeking relief based on Miller's holding that mandatory life without parole violates the Eighth Amendment. So I think even Malvo, when he originally sought habeas in this case, recognized the precise nature of Miller's holding, and I think it's extraordinarily hard to get away from that.</text>",2019

Kavanaugh,"You -- you want us to hold that a discretionary regime satisfies Miller and Montgomery and remand for consideration of all these things, forfeiture, whether it was really discretionary?","<speaker>Eric J. Feigin</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Malvo is arguing that his life without parole sentences for his murders are retroactively invalid under Miller even if Virginia law allowed him to seek a lower sentence based on his age. That's wrong for two reasons. First of all, the substantive retroactive holding of Miller is limited to mandatory sentences. Any objection Malvo has to the particular sentencing proceedings in his individual case would at best fall under what Montgomery describes as Miller's procedural component, which isn't retroactive. Second, all that procedural component requires is the opportunity to raise age as a reason for a lower sentence. Neither Montgomery nor Miller prescribes a precise formula for taking age into account, let alone requires a sentencer to consider age even when a defendant himself fails to put it at issue. Now, Justice Kavanaugh, you asked how we know that a discretionary scheme -- the existence of a discretionary scheme is sufficient to protect against the substantive right that Montgomery finds that Miller recognizes. I think we know that from a couple of different places. First, in Miller itself, I think the Court goes out of its way to compare and contrast discretionary schemes and mandatory schemes. I think you'll find this in particular at page 484 of Miller, noting that, basically, as -- as I read Miller, discretionary schemes are generally getting it right and mandatory schemes aren't. And I think it would be quite surprising that the kind of scheme the Court used as its baseline for comparison turns out, in fact, to be unconstitutional. But the second place we know it I think is from page 734 of Montgomery, where the Court says that the ability -- and you combine that with page 735 that makes clear it's the opportunity to consider age. That the procedural component of Miller, which is the opportunity to consider age, is what protects the substantive right. And if, as the Fourth Circuit supposed and the Virginia Supreme Court held in Jones II, Malvo actually did have the opportunity to seek a lower sentence based on his age, then I don't think he can recast his claim as a substantive claim under Miller that he had his substantive rights violated.</text>",2019

But, in most sentencing regimes, as you well know, throughout the country in the variety of sentencing courts, judges are required to consider all sorts of factors by state law.

Yet, it is routinely accepted that the judge has ""considered the factor"" if it has been raised or even if it's required as a matter of state law. There are lots of state cases and federal cases that say, so long as the issue's been raised, we assume the judge ""considered it.""

But Miller's rule does not cover Malvo's case, and the lower courts erred in holding otherwise. I'd like to make three points, one about Miller, one about Montgomery, and one about why this matters. First, if Miller's holding isn't concerned with mandatory sentences, much of this Court's language in Miller makes very little sense. Miller repeatedly stated its own holding in terms of mandatory sentences, and the Court's analysis specifically distinguished between mandatory and non-mandatory states. Second, Montgomery must be interpreted both in light of Miller and in light of the facts that were before the Court. All of the defendants before the Court in both Miller and Montgomery had received mandatory sentences, and this Court should not lightly interpret a decision about retroactivity as having retroactively announced a new rule governing non-mandatory sentences. Finally, the reason why habeas is so formal and restrictive is because habeas is extraordinarily costly.

14144,2019.18-217-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor,"And how about the case they cited where counsel did raise this argument about the youth and the judge said, I have no power?","<speaker>Eric J. Feigin</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Malvo is arguing that his life without parole sentences for his murders are retroactively invalid under Miller even if Virginia law allowed him to seek a lower sentence based on his age. That's wrong for two reasons. First of all, the substantive retroactive holding of Miller is limited to mandatory sentences. Any objection Malvo has to the particular sentencing proceedings in his individual case would at best fall under what Montgomery describes as Miller's procedural component, which isn't retroactive. Second, all that procedural component requires is the opportunity to raise age as a reason for a lower sentence. Neither Montgomery nor Miller prescribes a precise formula for taking age into account, let alone requires a sentencer to consider age even when a defendant himself fails to put it at issue. Now, Justice Kavanaugh, you asked how we know that a discretionary scheme -- the existence of a discretionary scheme is sufficient to protect against the substantive right that Montgomery finds that Miller recognizes. I think we know that from a couple of different places. First, in Miller itself, I think the Court goes out of its way to compare and contrast discretionary schemes and mandatory schemes. I think you'll find this in particular at page 484 of Miller, noting that, basically, as -- as I read Miller, discretionary schemes are generally getting it right and mandatory schemes aren't. And I think it would be quite surprising that the kind of scheme the Court used as its baseline for comparison turns out, in fact, to be unconstitutional. But the second place we know it I think is from page 734 of Montgomery, where the Court says that the ability -- and you combine that with page 735 that makes clear it's the opportunity to consider age. That the procedural component of Miller, which is the opportunity to consider age, is what protects the substantive right. And if, as the Fourth Circuit supposed and the Virginia Supreme Court held in Jones II, Malvo actually did have the opportunity to seek a lower sentence based on his age, then I don't think he can recast his claim as a substantive claim under Miller that he had his substantive rights violated.</text>",2019

Ratner</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to be very clear about what is and is not preserved when a defendant argues for a lower sentence than he receives. There are three key points. First, a defendant who argues for a lower sentence does preserve the claim that the district court unreasonably declined to grant the leniency requested. Second, a defendant does not preserve any procedural challenges or any challenges, however labeled, that go to something other than the length of the sentence. And, third, a defendant who argues for leniency on one ground in the district court does not preserve a claim for leniency on a different ground. Those three points all come from the same overarching principle that parties need to give the district court an opportunity to consider and resolve their claims. But, under Rule 51, they need to give the district court one opportunity, not two. And that's fundamentally where the court below erred.

Burgess</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Circuit's decision should be reversed for either of two independent reasons. First, a Rule 59(e) motion filed within 20 days of judgment is part of the first full opportunity to pursue habeas relief. It is not a second habeas application. In the 50 years between Rule 59's adoption and AEDPA's enactment, there is no record of a court ever treating a timely Rule 59 motion merely seeking reconsideration as though it were a second habeas application. AEDPA did not change this settled practice, and nothing in this Court's Gonzalez decision suggests otherwise. Rule 60(b) motions present obvious opportunities to circumvent AEDPA's restrictions, as the facts in Gonzalez itself well illustrate. There, the motion was filed years after the judgment and well after the end of any appellate proceedings. Rule 59(e) motions are different. They have to be filed within 28 days of judgment, they suspend the judgment's finality, and they result in a single appeal. Second, by dismissing Mr. Banister's appeal as untimely, the Fifth Circuit effectively penalized him for following the plain terms of Appellate Rule 4(a). There's no basis in the rule or in AEDPA for retroactively recharacterizing a timely Rule 59(e) motion and treating it as though it were never filed for purposes of Rule 4(a). On this issue, Texas and the United States notably rely on a new argument, as their position is that Mr. Banister's Rule 59 motion shouldn't count because it wasn't filed properly. But the basic problem with that argument is there's no properly filed requirement in Rule 4(a). And we think this Court should reject the government's invitation to rewrite the plain terms of that rule, which would significantly complicate what is supposed to be a clear, straightforward jurisdictional inquiry and would have implications for all civil proceedings in addition to habeas. I'd like to start with our first argument, and on that issue, our -- our rule is clear. If a motion is filed when a court still has authority to enter or revise the judgment, before any appeal, it is part of the first habeas proceeding. As a result, cannot be a second petition.

Burgess</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Circuit's decision should be reversed for either of two independent reasons. First, a Rule 59(e) motion filed within 20 days of judgment is part of the first full opportunity to pursue habeas relief. It is not a second habeas application. In the 50 years between Rule 59's adoption and AEDPA's enactment, there is no record of a court ever treating a timely Rule 59 motion merely seeking reconsideration as though it were a second habeas application. AEDPA did not change this settled practice, and nothing in this Court's Gonzalez decision suggests otherwise. Rule 60(b) motions present obvious opportunities to circumvent AEDPA's restrictions, as the facts in Gonzalez itself well illustrate. There, the motion was filed years after the judgment and well after the end of any appellate proceedings. Rule 59(e) motions are different. They have to be filed within 28 days of judgment, they suspend the judgment's finality, and they result in a single appeal. Second, by dismissing Mr. Banister's appeal as untimely, the Fifth Circuit effectively penalized him for following the plain terms of Appellate Rule 4(a). There's no basis in the rule or in AEDPA for retroactively recharacterizing a timely Rule 59(e) motion and treating it as though it were never filed for purposes of Rule 4(a). On this issue, Texas and the United States notably rely on a new argument, as their position is that Mr. Banister's Rule 59 motion shouldn't count because it wasn't filed properly. But the basic problem with that argument is there's no properly filed requirement in Rule 4(a). And we think this Court should reject the government's invitation to rewrite the plain terms of that rule, which would significantly complicate what is supposed to be a clear, straightforward jurisdictional inquiry and would have implications for all civil proceedings in addition to habeas.

And you're, of course, right that there is a default rule that is used when somebody just says dismissal for a 12(b)(6) motion. We assume that that's with prejudice as a kind of default rule.

Burgess</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Without-prejudice dismissals for failure to state a claim are not strikes under Section 1915(g) for three reasons. First, the statute uses a familiar legal phrase with a well-established meaning in the context relevant here. When courts review judicial orders to determine their impact on a future action, evaluating preclusion, for example, they conclusively presume that the phrase ""dismissed for failure to state a claim"" means dismissed with prejudice.

Second, the structure of the PLRA further supports that interpretation. Read together, the three dismissal categories identified in 1915(g) target actions that are facially meritless or otherwise abusive. Without-prejudice dismissals for failure to state a claim are different. They may be based on purely procedural defects, such as the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and it would be odd to impose a strike for such suits since Congress excluded from 1915(g)'s reach other categories of dismissals that don't implicate the merits or otherwise suggest abuse, such as dismissals based on sovereign immunity. Third and related, the other side's interpretation upsets the PLRA's balance by punishing prisoners for dismissals that, by definition, say nothing about the ultimate merits of their action.

To call this as a Heck bar comparable to immunity is one thing, because there you might have an argument that not counting as a strike a lack of jurisdiction, failure to exhaust, sovereign immunity, even potentially a Heck bar, those are all jurisdictional questions.

Whether it's immunity, Heck, or -- or failure to exhaust, you're making a legitimate claim. There's another independent ground for not having you come to the court.

Olson</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The text, structure, and history of the Prison Litigation Reform Act all support giving ""was dismissed"" its ordinary meaning in the three strikes provision. The text is straightforward. If a case was dismissed for failure to state a claim, it meets the statutory definition regardless of whether that dismissal was with or without prejudice because, in either circumstance, that case was dismissed, which is what the statute looks to. Second, the structure of the Act backs this ordinary meaning. The Prison Litigation Reform Act uses the phrase ""failure to state a claim"" several times in its structure -- in its -- in its text. Petitioner's proposed interpretation requires this Court to give that phrase one meaning in 1915(g), the three-strikes provision, and a different meaning in the rest of the Act. That violates basic rules of statutory interpretation. In addition, the three-strikes use of the categories frivolous and malicious alongside the category fails to state a claim counsels, as the colloquy with Chief Justice -- the Chief Justice illustrates, that these provisions should be given similar scope. Frivolous and malicious dismissals can be with and without prejudice. The same scope should apply here. What results is an easily administrable rule to see what happened, rather than look and analyze the consequences. Finally, the history of the Act supports this reading. This Court, in the Neitzke opinion in 1989, held that although it might be an appealing proposition, having sua sponte dismissals for failure to state a claim was inconsistent with the in forma pauperis statute in effect at that time. Congress responded to that suggestion in the Act a few years later, adding the opportunity for dismissals, sua sponte dismissals, and using the same language to count such dismissals as strikes.</text>",2019

Maybe in some district courts the incentives actually cut the other way. Some of my clerks who have clerked on the D.C.

So, if that's correct, if courts are doing this randomly or if some are subject to one set of incentives and others subject to an opposite set of incentives, but they're all trying to do the same thing, which is to deal with a complaint that has not pled sufficient facts and telling the person go do it again, why should we treat those two cases differently for purposes of counting strikes?","<speaker>Eric R.

I mean, they're just going to think that you've got to refile after something else happens.","<speaker>Eric A. Burgess</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Without-prejudice dismissals for failure to state a claim are not strikes under Section 1915(g) for three reasons. First, the statute uses a familiar legal phrase with a well-established meaning in the context relevant here. When courts review judicial orders to determine their impact on a future action, evaluating preclusion, for example, they conclusively presume that the phrase ""dismissed for failure to state a claim"" means dismissed with prejudice. In 1915(g), Congress used the same phrase in the same basic context. There's every reason to think Congress expected courts to apply the phrase's settled meaning rather than to convert ordinary without-prejudice dismissals into sanctions that restrict future suits. Second, the structure of the PLRA further supports that interpretation. Read together, the three dismissal categories identified in 1915(g) target actions that are facially meritless or otherwise abusive. Without-prejudice dismissals for failure to state a claim are different. They may be based on purely procedural defects, such as the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and it would be odd to impose a strike for such suits since Congress excluded from 1915(g)'s reach other categories of dismissals that don't implicate the merits or otherwise suggest abuse, such as dismissals based on sovereign immunity. Third and related, the other side's interpretation upsets the PLRA's balance by punishing prisoners for dismissals that, by definition, say nothing about the ultimate merits of their action. This interpretation frustrates the Act's objective to filter out bad claims while still allowing for consideration of the good, since it restricts a prisoner's ability to bring a potentially legitimate claim even after the prisoner has cured a procedural defect. I'd like to start with the text of the statute. The -- the other side's lead argument is that the term ""dismiss"" is sufficiently capacious to encompass both dismissals with prejudice or dismissals without prejudice as a -- as a dictionary matter. And we don't disagree with that proposition, but we don't think that argument takes adequate account of the full statutory phrase at issue here and the context in which it is being used.</text>",2019

That power has always included the power to set conditions of appointment, such as requiring that an elector live in the state or show up for the Electoral College meeting. One condition that states are clearly allowed to impose is that electors promise to support the presidential candidate preferred by the state's voters. States have been choosing electors on that basis since the founding. This Court approved that condition in Ray. And the other side admits that states can impose this condition. The only dispute here is whether states can enforce this condition or any other valid condition of appointment. Petitioners say no, or at least that's what they said in their brief. They say that states cannot remove or sanction electors after appointment for any reason, even if the elector is being bribed or blackmailed, even if they lied about their eligibility to serve in the first place, or even if they refuse to show up for the meeting of the Electoral College. That is not the law, as Petitioners now seem to acknowledge. Constitutional text, original understanding, historical practice, and this Court's precedent all demonstrate that states can enforce valid conditions of appointment like those here. Now I'd like to start by discussing original understanding because Petitioners want you to believe that this case presents a conflict between our country's long-standing practices and the framers' intent. But two stubborn facts refute their claim. First, the framers and their contemporaries clearly understood that states could remove or fine electors after appointment. From even before the Twelfth Amendment, many states had laws removing or fining electors for violating the conditions of their appointment, repudiating a central premise of Petitioners' claim. And, second, as this Court recognized in Ray and in McPherson, from the very first presidential election, states have been choosing electors specifically because they had promised to support a particular presidential candidate. And this contradicts Petitioners' claim that the framers viewed the exercise of discretion as central to the elector role, and it shows that Petitioners' quarrel is not just with our long-standing practice; it is with the framers themselves.

They say that states cannot remove or sanction electors after appointment for any reason, even if the elector is being bribed or blackmailed, even if they lied about their eligibility to serve in the first place, or even if they refuse to show up for the meeting of the Electoral College. That is not the law, as Petitioners now seem to acknowledge.

Now I'd like to start by discussing original understanding because Petitioners want you to believe that this case presents a conflict between our country's long-standing practices and the framers' intent. But two stubborn facts refute their claim. First, the framers and their contemporaries clearly understood that states could remove or fine electors after appointment. From even before the Twelfth Amendment, many states had laws removing or fining electors for violating the conditions of their appointment, repudiating a central premise of Petitioners' claim. And, second, as this Court recognized in Ray and in McPherson, from the very first presidential election, states have been choosing electors specifically because they had promised to support a particular presidential candidate. And this contradicts Petitioners' claim that the framers viewed the exercise of discretion as central to the elector role, and it shows that Petitioners' quarrel is not just with our long-standing practice; it is with the framers themselves.

18738,2019.18-9526-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"Thank you, Chief. And good morning, Mr. Gershengorn. I want to talk a bit about the history and maybe make a comment, and you and other -- your colleagues can react. But this is not a situation where there's a reservation in an existing state and Congress has arguably diminished a reservation. This is a case with a territory that, by 1890, Indian territory was predominantly white, about 60 percent of the population, also a significant black population, about 10 percent, and about 30 percent Indian. And the question, as of 1890, how do we get there to that situation, you go back to the treaties of 1832 and 1833 that grant the Creeks and the Five Tribes land, but then the Civil War is key, and the tribes, the Five Tribes, all align with the Confederacy in the Civil War. The tribes have black slaves, lots of black slaves. And then there's a new treaty in 1866 because the United States is not happy that the tribes have aligned with the Confederacy. Why does that matter for us? Because, in that new treaty in 1866, it grants rights-of-way to railroads, the railroads lead to settlements, the settlements lead to new towns that are predominantly white. So, by 1890, you have an odd situation of an Indian territory nominally that's predominantly white. So Congress's options at that time are -- are to remove the -- the whites, to remove the Indians. Neither of those was going to happen. So the other remaining options were tribal government over non-Indians, which, of course, is contrary to tradition, or to create a new state. And Congress chose the new state option, it seems, and then had a lot of things that happened over the next 17 years. So I just wanted to get that history out there because I think we're talking about Indian territory and reservations when, in fact, it was 60 percent white, 10 percent black, 30 percent Indian in the relevant territory.","<speaker>Ian H.

The decision below must be reversed because the text makes clear that Congress never terminated the Creek reservation and never transferred federal criminal jurisdiction to Oklahoma. I have four basic points to make this morning. First, the Creek Nation had a reservation. The relevant treaties reserved the lands from sale and solemnly guaranteed the lands for the Creek to govern. The text of both treaties and statutes expressly identified the Creek land as a reservation. Nothing more was needed. Second, Congress did not establish -- disestablish that reservation. Indeed, Congress considered hallmark language of disestablishment and rejected it. Congress initially sought cession yet instead provided only for allotment. Then, when congressional inaction would have dissolved the tribe, Congress instead preserved the tribe and its government for all purposes authorized by law, and it did so against the backdrop of existing tribal authority to legislate over reservation land. Those congressional judgments should be respected. Third, Congress did not transfer criminal jurisdiction to Oklahoma. At statehood, the Major Crimes Act established exclusive federal jurisdiction over enumerated crimes in ""any state of the United States.""

So, if we were to look at the narrow question whether Congress has provided for the trial of cases like this one in state court, what would an opinion like that look like?

Verrilli, Jr.</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1113(2) of ERISA requires that claims for breach of fiduciary duty be brought within three years of when the plaintiff first had actual knowledge of the breach. In 2015, the Respondent, Sulyma, sued, claiming that his retirement plans imprudently overinvested in hedge funds and commodities. But more than three years before that suit was filed, Sulyma received plan disclosures that apprised him of the precise investment allocations he later claimed were imprudent. The Ninth Circuit held that those disclosures would not trigger the three-year bar because Sulyma testified that he had not read them and Intel, therefore, had not established that he had subjective awareness of what was disclosed. The Ninth Circuit was wrong to read the statute to require proof of subjective awareness. Under Section 1113(2), plan participants have actual knowledge of facts that are actually given to them in mandatory ERISA disclosures. That reading respects ERISA's text and the statutory emphasis on -- the structural emphasis in the statute on robust disclosure by plan fiduciaries and private policing by plan participants. The Ninth Circuit's reading upends that balance. It effectively doubles from three to six years the period in which plaintiffs can exploit hindsight bias to second-guess investments, even when plans have fully disclosed the basis for those investments, and it introduces arbitrariness and intractable proof problems. Now one way to bring the correct interpretation of Section 1 -- 1113(2) into focus is by considering the provision as it was originally enacted in 1974, and that's reproduced at pages 38 and 39 of the Blue Brief. The original statute provided that the three-year limitations period would be triggered either when a plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or when the plan filed with the Department of Labor a report that included facts from which a participant could reasonably learn of the facts of the breach. Now, if you read the statute in the way that the Ninth Circuit read it, it doesn't make any sense as it was originally enacted because the three-year period would be triggered in a situation in which the plan disclosed to the Department of Labor the facts that establish the breach but not when the -- when the plan disclosed to the plan participants themselves in mandatory disclosures the very same facts that would trigger it if provided to the Department of Labor. That just doesn't make any sense of the statute. Our reading, in contrast, makes perfect sense of the statute. And if I could, I -- I will start with the text and -- and, I think, try to take a minute and explain why we've got a perfectly reasonable linguistic understanding of Section 1113(2). And it's this: A plaintiff has actual knowledge of facts actually provided to him in mandatory disclosures because, when the plaintiff receives the disclosure, he has, in the word of the statute's past tense ""had,"" but he has in his possession a body -- the body of knowledge contained in the disclosures.
