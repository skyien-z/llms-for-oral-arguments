Schleimer</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It's been a little less than two years since this Court handed down the decision in Buckeye Check Cashing Service v. Cardegna. Within nine months after Buckeye was decided, the California Court of Appeal issued its decision in this case excising the issue of validity or legality of a contract from an entire category of arbitrations, declaring it off limits to arbitration. The contract in this case couldn't be more clear. It states quite specifically that the validity or legality of the contract shall be arbitrated. So there was no consideration given to the intent of the parties. The Federal Arbitration Act, of course, applies in this case. There was never really a dispute about that, because it'S a contract between the citizens of two States and it was never disputed that the Federal Arbitration Act would apply. If left standing, the decision in this case could result in a multiplicity of State law decisions and statutes eliminating arbitration in entire classes of cases through the mere expediency of having it go to an administrative agency.</text>",2007

And I would like to direct the Court's attention to page 101 of the joint appendix, because the language I'm going to be talking about appears there in the course of the Governor's request for reconsideration of DOJ's objection. This is the language from this Court's opinion in Young against Fordice. And it starts midway down the page, where the Court says that: ""The simple fact that a voting practice is unlawful under State law does not show entirely by itself that the practice was never in force or effect. "" We agree. And then the Court goes on to say: ""A State, after all, might maintain in effect for many years a plan that technically or in one respect or another violated some provision of State law. "" citing Perkins against Matthews and City of Lockhart against United States. All that Young against Fordice does is explain that that case is a sport that deviates from the general rule that this Court has had that when a law is in force or effect its constitutionality under State law doesn't matter. I'd also like to direct the Court's attention to page 114 of the joint appendix, where Act 85-237's text appears, and direct you to the bottom of the page in section 4, which says: ""This Act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and approval by the Governor upon its otherwise becoming a law.

The Federal Circuit was wrong because, as this Court has explained, the statutory term ""attorney fees""... and now I'm quoting... ""takes into account the work not only of attorneys but others whose labor contributes to the work product for which an attorney bills her client. "" Employing that reasoning the Court held, in Missouri versus Jenkins, that paralegal fees are compensable at market rates as attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. section 1988. The question in this case is whether there is any reason EAJA should be interpreted differently. The answer is no. And, indeed, the only potentially relevant difference between the two statutes... that EAJA requires fees to be awarded at prevailing market rates, and section 1988 requires only that fees be reasonable... provides stronger support for market-based recovery of paralegal fees under EAJA than it would under section 1988.</text>",2007

Olson</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For 10 years, New York relied on political party primaries to nominate general election candidates for supreme court justice, but that process discouraged qualified candidates and spawned unseemly, expensive, and potentially corrupting fundraising by judicial candidates. So the legislature substituted an indirect party primary system at which delegates are elected who, in turn, select general election candidates at political party conventions. The Second Circuit concluded that the delegate convention statutes enabled political parties to exercise too much influence at the expense of the insurgent party members or insurgent candidates and struck those statutes down as facially unconstitutional and reinstated the discredited primary process. The issue in this case is whether the delegate-convention system is facially unconstitutional because it allows party leaders to defeat the aspirations of party insurgents.

And secondly, I would say that in considering that question, Justice Kennedy, the important thing is to consider what is the intended role that the State gives to the participants in this process? And what the role here is that individual voters have the opportunity to vote for local delegates who are to represent their interests at the convention. As Cousins instructs, once they have the opportunity to pull a lever for the delegate that shares their values and their preferences, their right of suffrage is satisfied. What they do not have, what Respondents and what the lower courts would like to have exist but doesn't exist and isn't required under the Constitution, is the opportunity for rank-and-file voters to vote directly for the candidates at the nomination stage, and that's the difference between a delegate-based convention and a primary. If we agree, and I think the Court would agree, that there is no right to a primary... that's something, in fact, that's conceded in this case; there is no constitutional right to a primary... then there is no State requirement that there be a direct opportunity for association between voter and candidate at the nomination phase; that it is perfectly appropriate and constitutional for that association to be between voter and delegate, and the voters then rely on their locally... elected delegates to advance their interest in the convention process. That's the difference between a convention and a primary. We think it's a critical one here. So the cases--</text>",2007

Becker</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Both parts of the question presented in this case should be answered ""yes"". For a treble damage civil RICO claim based on fraud, someone must rely on the alleged misrepresentation, and that someone must be the plaintiff. But that's the very nature of a fraud claim. Plaintiffs here claim that they were injured by reason of a RICO violation, the predicate acts of which involved a scheme or artifice to defraud. But no one in this case is arguing that a civil RICO claim based on fraud can proceed without someone relying. So some reliance is required; the only question is who must rely? And we submit that the natural answer is the plaintiff. A plaintiff who hasn't relied to his detriment on an alleged misrepresentation hasn't been defrauded; he hasn't been injured by reason of a scheme to defraud. Plaintiffs here haven't alleged that they relied on any misrepresentation; they haven't even alleged that they received a misrepresentation.</text>",2007

It's hard for me to understand why that's relevant in this calculation. Suppose there's a case where it's perfectly clear that certain strikes were not racially motivated. Let's say the prosecution has the strategy of striking every lawyer who's on the panel. It strikes every white lawyer and it strikes every black lawyer. Then what is the relevance of the fact that the black lawyers were peremptorily challenged?,"<speaker>Stephen B. Bright</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The decision here of the majority of the Louisiana Supreme Court on remand from this Court is an extraordinary departure from the lessons that this Court taught in its Miller-El decisions. And I point out sort of three overarching errors in that regard. First, the majority looked at each of the Miller-El factors or some of them, and largely discounted them. That there were five African-Americans struck, they whittled that down to two. That there was disparate questioning, they identified that of the white jurors and Jeffrey Brooks, but they said that counted for the State. And Miller-El clearly teaches that it didn't. They found there was no racial implication in the mention of O.J. Simpson case from the start of the case all the way through, because neither O.J. Simpson's race nor Mr. Snyder's race was mentioned. Secondly, there were some Miller-El factors that were not considered at all, not even acknowledged. For example, one of the most powerful ones, the failure to ask any questions of Jeffrey Brooks or Elaine Scott. There are very ambiguous general reasons for striking them. They asked no questions. In this case, you could ask anybody any questions you wanted as a lawyer. And then thirdly, when they got to the point of considering them cumulatively, they had now whittled them down to where there was very little to consider. And our position is that what Justice Kimball did, the author of the original decision, who wrote the dissenting opinion, one of the two dissents here, actually did what this Court remanded this case to do, which was reconsideration in light of Miller-El, because when you consider all those factors together, nothing answers the question of or explains them as well as race. You can pick each piece out, each leaf out and you can try to find an innocent explanation for it.

Bright</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The decision here of the majority of the Louisiana Supreme Court on remand from this Court is an extraordinary departure from the lessons that this Court taught in its Miller-El decisions. And I point out sort of three overarching errors in that regard. First, the majority looked at each of the Miller-El factors or some of them, and largely discounted them. That there were five African-Americans struck, they whittled that down to two. That there was disparate questioning, they identified that of the white jurors and Jeffrey Brooks, but they said that counted for the State. And Miller-El clearly teaches that it didn't. They found there was no racial implication in the mention of O.J. Simpson case from the start of the case all the way through, because neither O.J. Simpson's race nor Mr. Snyder's race was mentioned. Secondly, there were some Miller-El factors that were not considered at all, not even acknowledged. For example, one of the most powerful ones, the failure to ask any questions of Jeffrey Brooks or Elaine Scott. There are very ambiguous general reasons for striking them. They asked no questions. In this case, you could ask anybody any questions you wanted as a lawyer. And then thirdly, when they got to the point of considering them cumulatively, they had now whittled them down to where there was very little to consider. And our position is that what Justice Kimball did, the author of the original decision, who wrote the dissenting opinion, one of the two dissents here, actually did what this Court remanded this case to do, which was reconsideration in light of Miller-El, because when you consider all those factors together, nothing answers the question of or explains them as well as race. You can pick each piece out, each leaf out and you can try to find an innocent explanation for it. But when you stand back and look at it all together... and that's why the court missed the fact that the back strike was racially motivated in this case. It just simply didn't look at these things in the context--</text>",2007

The statute is structured to prevent criminals from using the fruits of their crimes to promote or to conceal their illegal activities.

Because the word ""proceeds"" appears in the introductory section of the statute, those kinds of restrictions would apply to both concealment and promotion cases. For example, the statute wouldn't cover expense payments that are structured to conceal the unlawful nature and source of the funds involved.

And I think it's important to frame the discussion by starting with the actual jury instruction that's at issue in this case. It's at Pet. App. 301a. It says that a managerial agent is someone who supervises other employees and has responsibility for, and authority over, particular aspects of a corporation's business.

As its own internal documents explain, Captain Hazelwood was in charge of what they called a business unit of Exxon Shipping.

He was the person who decided on behalf of Exxon that it was safe to leave port the night of March 23, 1989. Now, it is our submission that it is perfectly appropriate to expose the corporation to punitive damages based on the reckless acts of such an individual.
