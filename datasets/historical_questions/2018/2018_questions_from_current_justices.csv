1962,2018.18-431-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch,"Mr. Feigin, looking at the language of (c)(3), the word ""offense"" is in a prefatory clause before (A) and (B). And as I understand the government's position, (A), we will continue to read ""offense"" to mean the offense charged on the books and look at the elements. But, with respect to (B), you'd like us to look at the facts and treat the word ""offense"" there to mean what did the defendant actually do. We don't normally read prefatory language to mean two different things in two clauses that follow. And, in fact, the government earlier this year in -- I -- I don't know how to pronounce it, Cochise, I think it is, argued precisely this point, that normally a single word is given a single construction, at least throughout the same paragraph.

1966,2018.18-431-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan,"-- can I -- can I ask you some further questions about the language of the statute? And I guess I want to do it by comparing it to this bill that's currently pending in Congress which is meant to change this provision in order to make it fact-specific. And so this bill, rather than says -- rather than saying an -- an -- an offense that by its nature involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used, instead says an offense that by -- excuse me, an offense that based on the facts underlying the offense -- so they substitute ""by its nature"" for ""based on the facts underlying the offense"" -- and then they change the tense and they say involved a substantial risk that force may have been used, right? So ""by its nature"" versus ""based on the facts"" and changing the tense to make it clear that what we're looking at is something that has occurred and that we're able, actually, to make a fact-specific determination about it. Now that's the way you would write a provision of the kind that you want. This is not the way you would write a provision of the kind that you want. ""By its nature"" clearly is like, what is this offense ordinarily about? And then the use of the present tense is -- is inconsistent with this notion that the jury in this case is having to look back to determine the particular facts of a particular crime.","<speaker>Eric J.

I think that that's pretty clear. The question is sort of, you know, did -- did you propose a different kind of warning? So let me give you a hypothetical. Suppose that you manufacture a drug and there's some evidence, whether it's enough, hard to know, but there's some evidence that it causes ovarian cancer, and you, the drug manufacturer, proposes a warning to the FDA, but instead of saying that the drug causes ovarian cancer, you say it causes ovarian cysts. Now ovarian cysts are nothing that anybody wants to have, but they're an inconvenience. They're not ovarian cancer. And the FDA says: No, we don't think that that's the issue at all.

May not be clearly related to the atypical -- forget that word -- fractures that have been reported in the literature. Discussion of the risk factors for stress fractures is not warranted and is not adequately supported by the available literature. Nowhere did they say that the atypical fractures are not supported by the literature, and nowhere did they say don't change it. The rest of the letter tells you make changes and we'll come back and talk more about this.

In other words, what are we to look to when we decide whether it's impossible for Merck to change its label? Because one easy way of thinking about whether it's impossible for Merck to change its label is to say: Did the FDA tell Merck that it couldn't change its label in the relevant way? If the FDA told Merck that, then it's impossible. But, if the FDA didn't tell Merck that, whatever is in the FDA's head, if the FDA didn't tell Merck that, then it's not impossible for Merck to change its label, and it has responsibility over its label, and to the extent that it thinks that the literature supports a change, it should change its label.","<speaker>Malcolm L.

The first is that, in October of 2010, when the FDA ultimately decided that an addition to the warnings and precautions section of these labels was warranted, it rejected Merck's proposal that the warning include repeated uses of the term ""stress fracture"". And FDA did express at that time the concern that practitioners, for whom that term usually connoted a relatively minor event, might read it as understating the seriousness of the potential health risk of Fosamax. That potential type of confusion needs to be distinguished from the question, was FDA confused by Merck's submission as a whole? And there's no reason to think that that was so. At page 670 of the Joint Appendix, Merck kind of, in the introductory section of its proposal, summarizes what it's -- the warning that it's proposing to add, and it says at the very top of the page: Merck is proposing to add language to both the precaution and adverse reaction post-marketing experience section of the label to describe low-energy fractures that have been reported, of which some have been stress insufficiency at the subtrochanteric region of the femoral shaft.

What do we do about that?

8690,2018.17-1026-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor,"Because the way it approached the issue was pretty clear. It said, in deciding whether counsel is ineffective, first you determine whether a defendant would have appealed. And it said there's two ways to make that determination. A, was there a plea waiver? If yes, then he wouldn't have appealed. Or, second, did he tell the attorney he wanted to appeal? And this is the second of those. But I can't square your position with Flores-Ortega because Flores-Ortega seemed to accept as a working proposition that given that there is even, in a guilty plea, there are waivers of some issues but not others, that the question of whether a defendant would have appealed takes into account the plea waiver at that stage, but once a defendant tells an attorney to appeal, that's his choice.

Jorgensen</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: My friend keeps referring to a waiver of issues, but there was no waiver of issues in this case. There was a waiver of a procedure. There was an appellate waiver. Thus, in similar situations like this where there is an appeal waiver, there has been a waiver of a proceeding, not just of those issues. And I think this case actually provides a very good example of that. The plea agreement in this case that was signed by Mr. Garza contains many provisions. Some of those provisions include that he would plead guilty to certain charges, that the State would not then bring -- bring other charges and would dismiss an enhancement. Mr. Garza agreed to the particular sentence he would receive. The plea agreement lists many of the -- lists the rights that are required to be given under Idaho's Rule 11, which is the substantive equivalent to Federal Rule 11.

Second, it's not true that Congress wanted to detain and deport all criminal aliens, as the government claims in its reply brief at page 12. And, three, if Congress really wanted what the executive branch claims here, it would have simply written a statute that says people in these four categories shall be detained without a hearing until removed. That is not what Congress did. Instead, Congress wrote a statute, 1226(c), as an exception to the general detention scheme in 1226(a) which applies except as provided in subsection (c), not as except -- not except as provided in section (c)(2), as the government would have it.

The first anomaly is, as you noted, that the transition rules, which were meant to be a ramp-up to the permanent rule, are completely superfluous.

The second anomaly with the government's reading is -- and the government struggled with this in response, again, to your questions, Justice Kagan -- is that if the only qualification to be subject to mandatory detention is that you fall into one of the four categories in A through D, they necessarily read out the prior criminal custody requirement.

Let's start with the history. Justice Sotomayor, you asked a question about the priority of enactment, the fact that this statute was originally enacted in 1831, even though the current version of Section 1920 is much more recent. What this Court said in Crawford Fitting is that the priority of enactment does not matter. Section 1920 presumptively applies in all civil cases, regardless of when those provisions were adopted. Going back to the original history, what is it that the term ""full costs"" was enacted in order to do? We think that it does a couple things. Five days after setting up the federal judiciary, Congress enacted the Process Act, telling federal courts to look to state fee bills in order to determine which costs could be shifted between litigants. That was the regime that prevailed at the time that this provision was added to the Copyright Act in 1831. There were two general types of state fee bill provisions that would have made the word ""full"" in full costs necessary, and we give a couple examples on page 17 of our brief, Footnote 1. The first type of case are statutes that impose some sort of limitation on costs. So an example would be the first statute, a Kentucky statute providing ""the plaintiff shall recover his full costs although the damages do not exceed 40 shillings."" There were a number of statutes that said, if your damages were not above a certain threshold, you would get no more cost than damages. Forty shillings was a typical amount. So this provision tells you that, even if your damages are below that type of threshold, nevertheless, you get your full costs. The second type of case is a case of a statutory multiplier. So the Mississippi statute, for instance, provided a landlord can recover ""double the value of rent in arrear and distrained for with full costs of the suit."" So you get double damages along with your full costs. And that's actually the sense in which we think the 1831 Copyright Act used the term ""full costs"" because, remember, that for an infringement, half of any forfeiture would go to the government and the other half would go to the plaintiff, along with their full costs.

Five days after setting up the federal judiciary, Congress enacted the Process Act, telling federal courts to look to state fee bills in order to determine which costs could be shifted between litigants. That was the regime that prevailed at the time that this provision was added to the Copyright Act in 1831. There were two general types of state fee bill provisions that would have made the word ""full"" in full costs necessary, and we give a couple examples on page 17 of our brief, Footnote 1. The first type of case are statutes that impose some sort of limitation on costs. So an example would be the first statute, a Kentucky statute providing ""the plaintiff shall recover his full costs although the damages do not exceed 40 shillings."" There were a number of statutes that said, if your damages were not above a certain threshold, you would get no more cost than damages. Forty shillings was a typical amount. So this provision tells you that, even if your damages are below that type of threshold, nevertheless, you get your full costs. The second type of case is a case of a statutory multiplier. So the Mississippi statute, for instance, provided a landlord can recover ""double the value of rent in arrear and distrained for with full costs of the suit."" So you get double damages along with your full costs. And that's actually the sense in which we think the 1831 Copyright Act used the term ""full costs"" because, remember, that for an infringement, half of any forfeiture would go to the government and the other half would go to the plaintiff, along with their full costs. So the word ""full"" in that phrase tells you, even though the plaintiff is only getting half of the recovery, nevertheless, the plaintiff gets their full costs.</text>",2018

Now, in the facts of Illinois Brick and, indeed, in the facts of all the Illinois Brick cases that we've discussed, you had both. So you didn't have to separate the two. And now, here, you don't have both, because this is not a vertical supply chain, but there still is a pass-through mechanism. So then the question is, does Illinois Brick apply to that or not? And I think what Justice Breyer was suggesting to you, that as long as it's not that vertical supply chain where the person is not buying from the monopolist itself, here, the person is transacting with the monopolist itself, that that's what separates this case from Illinois Brick and makes it entirely different, notwithstanding that there's some kind of pass-through mechanism involved.","<speaker>Daniel M.

Wall</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The only damages theory in this monopolization action is rooted in a 30 percent commission that Apple charges app developers and which allegedly causes those developers to increase app prices to consumers.

If the commission increases beyond the competitive level, but apps developers do not change their apps prices, consumers suffer no damages.

At least you've got a -- you've got a reasonable argument under that provision. But the two provisions that seem to me to create a lot of problems for your position are 15 U.S.A. -- 15 U.S.C. 1692a(6), which creates a special definition of ""debt collector"" for a purpose that's not relevant here, and that refers to any business the principal purpose of which is the enforcement of security interests.

Going back to something that Justice Alito said, the reason I find it a difficult question is it seems to me that judicial foreclosures, non-judicial foreclosures, fall within both. They -- you know, these people are debt collectors under the language of the statute, and these people are enforcing security interests under the language of the statute. But that can't be right because the grammar of the statute suggests that we now have to kick them out of one or the other. All right? And so the question is, which do we kick them out of? Do we say, notwithstanding that they look like debt collectors, we're not going to treat them like debt collectors, or do we say that, notwithstanding that they enforce security interests, we're going to pretend that they don't? So, when I think about it that way, I kind of think: Well, I don't know, foreclosures are paradigmatic enforcement of security interests. There's nothing that gets more enforcing a security interest than foreclosing on a mortgage.

It is an indirect attempt because the foreclosure process is designed by law to automatically sell the consumer's house to obtain payment on the consumer's debt.

We think that the easiest way to resolve this case is to focus directly on the pre-foreclosure notices. Those notices are quintessential FDCPA communications. They just so happen to arise in the foreclosure context. They state that there is a default on the debt. They state the amount of the debt owed. They state to whom the debt is owed.

So, in all of the situations before we apply the Bill of Rights to this -- before we apply the Bill of Rights to states, they did things that, under incorporation, were unconstitutional. And in most of our cases, they were history going both ways. Some states did; some states didn't. So, really, what the issue that we have to look at isn't -- is where has our understanding come to in terms of a particular Bill of Rights? And in Austin, we said it is a long part of history that punitive sanctions cannot be excessive. And Justice Scalia said it very well: For the Eighth Amendment to limit cash fines while permitting -- permitting limitless in-kind assessments would make little sense, altering only the form of the Star Chamber abuses. So, at a certain point in Austin, we looked at what had happened to in rem forfeiture and realized that we had just changed the Star Chamber form. I -- I -- I don't actually understand your argument based on history because, without incorporation, the history's going to be what you want it to be. The real question is the fundamental right. Are we trying to avoid a society that's like the Char -- Star Chamber?

And if I could just make three or four points why that's right and try to simplify things a bit in response to the questioning. So, first, I think you can really just begin and end with the text here. The statute says burglary. This Court has already held that that means any statute with these basic elements which include remaining with intent and -- and that's true regardless of the exact definition or label. And -- and this is just what it means to remain in a place. You remain there as long as you stay. That's what this Court already held in Cores, the case about the alien crewman who remained in the United States unlawfully because he was still here. And that's also how this works in the law of trespass, which I think is really important here because it has the same pairing, to enter land or remain on land without permission. And the ""remaining"" prong for trespass is a continuing trespass. It's telling you that if you're on somebody's else's land without their permission, it doesn't matter how -- how you got there, how long you've been there; you're under a continuing obligation to leave. And I think the -- the right way to understand the -- the -- the Taylor formulation and -- and really what's happening in these state laws is -- is aligning their burglary law with trespass. So that there's a trespasser in your house or some other building or other structure like that, and they have the intent to commit the crime, that's what burglary is.

Because we have statutes that have pre-enforcement review and then explicitly allow review in the enforcement proceeding. We have statutes that allow pre-enforcement review and explicitly bar review in the enforcement proceeding, Clean Air Act. And, here, the statute's silent. And the question is what the default rule should be. And to Justice Alito's point, given the due process considerations, to Justice Breyer's point, why the absence of -- of law on this, the absence of law, I think, is because judicial review has always been assumed in enforcement proceedings, unless it's explicitly barred. That's why there's an absence of law, I -- I believe, in this instance. And to your point about, well, they can go through this other convoluted method of motion for reconsideration: If you're going to allow that, why not just allow the review in the enforcement proceeding and -- and have a more efficient process?

But what strikes me is that when we think about that, those officials really are thinking in gross, if you know what I mean. They're thinking about a method of execution as applied to the general class of people and deciding that it's appropriate. And what, of course, makes this case very different is that it's not in gross. It's a particular person that says I have a highly unusual condition that will make the execution highly unusual, that will have me suffer highly unusual pain. And in that context, I think all of that stuff that we talked about in Baze about why we should refer to state-considered judgments really falls away because there's been no considered judgment, surely by the legislature and, in general, by officials, about -- about one particular person.

They've got an executive agency acting as judge with an executive director who can pick the judges, who can substitute judges, can reexamine what those judges say, and change the ruling, and you've got another government agency being the prosecutor at the same time.

Second, the estoppel that was enacted by Congress specifically references the jurisdiction of the district court and the International Trade Commission, not the Court of Federal Claims, where the government's patent litigation takes place, reinforcing the definition of ""person"" not to include the government.

It basically said the case was wrong, and then it found some distinction that wasn't even relevant to the question and said we don't have to overrule it because there is this distinction.

This prosecutor would question a white person who said that he or she had reservations about the death penalty, and the questions are all designed to rehabilitate the person. You know, the prosecutor would say: Well, if the law required you to do it, you could follow the law, couldn't you? And then the person would say yes.

That's where the principle is embodied, and that says something that ought to be uncontroversial, and that is, if you make a product and the ordinary use or maintenance of that product is going to cause a harm that you know about, then you need to warn about that. And the court of appeals here quite explicitly limited its holding to situations in which you have a product that has a part and that part is required for it to operate. And so if I could just point us to the first operative sentence of the court of appeals' opinion. It's at 2a of the Joint Appendix. It's not that long. ""The defense's basic idea"" -- this is bare-metal -- ""is that a manufacturer who delivers a product, bare-metal, that is, without the insulation or other material that must be added for the product's proper operation."" And so it is concerned only there with the case in which you just -- these machines will not work if they don't have asbestos in them. But it's worse for that -- for the defendants in terms of their liability, because as been -- as has been suggested, it is the operation and maintenance of the machine that makes the danger worse. So Justice Breyer or -- and Justice Sotomayor discussed a situation of how it is that asbestos can be on a shelf and it's not at all dangerous, but if you put it in the machine and you subject it to the temperature of 100 -- 850 degrees and you compress it and you leave it there over time, it will degrade to the point that, when you have ordinary maintenance, which is specified in the manual for the machine, and you are digging it out and chopping it up, that creates asbestos dust. Asbestos dust is a distinct danger that causes a distinct harm from asbestos as a part. And that is the concern here. And that is when you are maintaining the machine as you're supposed to, as you are directed to by the manual created by the Defendants here, you have an injury to which you are subjected. There's a pretty good illustration of that, and that's their own concession that when they ship the machine with the original gasket in it or when they provide the 992 replacement gaskets that Foster Wheeler did, who's one of the Defendants, they're liable. They recognize it's part of their machine. Maintaining their machine is creating the risk. Their responsibility for that, for warning us, telling us wear a mask in the manual, doesn't change when we get to the 993rd gasket. Now I take the kind of law and economics take on this to be, well, who's the most efficient party to warn? And I want to explain why it is that they are. But just to pause for a second, that, I think, is probably the function of maritime law here, and that is even if you disagreed with us and believed that there was a division in how the common law was applied in these circumstances, there is a special solicitude for sailors that you would say requires the warning by the manufacturers here. And if the Navy believed there was over-warning, the Navy would prohibit giving this warning. Now why are they the most efficient party to give the warning? First, it's their machine. They're much more familiar with how the parts work than the part manufacturer because the parts can be used for lots of different machines. What happens with a gasket, for example, is we'll get shipped a set of asbestos board, and it will be cut out to fit inside whatever flange or whatever pipe connection is inside the machine. The people who know how that's going to operate, how much pressure is going to be on it, is the maker of the machine. The asbestos packing, it comes off a shelf. It gets put in the machine. Now who knows how the machine will affect the asbestos? The maker of the machine. The real manufacturer that's going to point to the cases that he's citing are the makers of the asbestos replacement parts, because he says examples like, well, you know, this could be used for lots and lots of different applications.

But it's worse for that -- for the defendants in terms of their liability, because as been -- as has been suggested, it is the operation and maintenance of the machine that makes the danger worse. So Justice Breyer or -- and Justice Sotomayor discussed a situation of how it is that asbestos can be on a shelf and it's not at all dangerous, but if you put it in the machine and you subject it to the temperature of 100 -- 850 degrees and you compress it and you leave it there over time, it will degrade to the point that, when you have ordinary maintenance, which is specified in the manual for the machine, and you are digging it out and chopping it up, that creates asbestos dust. Asbestos dust is a distinct danger that causes a distinct harm from asbestos as a part. And that is the concern here. And that is when you are maintaining the machine as you're supposed to, as you are directed to by the manual created by the Defendants here, you have an injury to which you are subjected. There's a pretty good illustration of that, and that's their own concession that when they ship the machine with the original gasket in it or when they provide the 992 replacement gaskets that Foster Wheeler did, who's one of the Defendants, they're liable. They recognize it's part of their machine. Maintaining their machine is creating the risk. Their responsibility for that, for warning us, telling us wear a mask in the manual, doesn't change when we get to the 993rd gasket. Now I take the kind of law and economics take on this to be, well, who's the most efficient party to warn? And I want to explain why it is that they are. But just to pause for a second, that, I think, is probably the function of maritime law here, and that is even if you disagreed with us and believed that there was a division in how the common law was applied in these circumstances, there is a special solicitude for sailors that you would say requires the warning by the manufacturers here. And if the Navy believed there was over-warning, the Navy would prohibit giving this warning. Now why are they the most efficient party to give the warning? First, it's their machine. They're much more familiar with how the parts work than the part manufacturer because the parts can be used for lots of different machines. What happens with a gasket, for example, is we'll get shipped a set of asbestos board, and it will be cut out to fit inside whatever flange or whatever pipe connection is inside the machine. The people who know how that's going to operate, how much pressure is going to be on it, is the maker of the machine. The asbestos packing, it comes off a shelf. It gets put in the machine. Now who knows how the machine will affect the asbestos? The maker of the machine. The real manufacturer that's going to point to the cases that he's citing are the makers of the asbestos replacement parts, because he says examples like, well, you know, this could be used for lots and lots of different applications. So take a maker in their mind of the asbestos gasket material or the asbestos packing. It's not necessarily going to be used on a Navy destroyer in a GE turbine.

They're much more familiar with how the parts work than the part manufacturer because the parts can be used for lots of different machines. What happens with a gasket, for example, is we'll get shipped a set of asbestos board, and it will be cut out to fit inside whatever flange or whatever pipe connection is inside the machine. The people who know how that's going to operate, how much pressure is going to be on it, is the maker of the machine. The asbestos packing, it comes off a shelf. It gets put in the machine. Now who knows how the machine will affect the asbestos? The maker of the machine. The real manufacturer that's going to point to the cases that he's citing are the makers of the asbestos replacement parts, because he says examples like, well, you know, this could be used for lots and lots of different applications. So take a maker in their mind of the asbestos gasket material or the asbestos packing. It's not necessarily going to be used on a Navy destroyer in a GE turbine.

And, third, the appeal was properly considered based upon this Court's decisions in Harris Truck Lines and Thompson. And I'd like to start with timeliness under the federal rules.

So the question is, is the burden that you're speaking about of there being, perhaps, you've pointed to 10 examples, the briefs, of cases that in your view should not have gone to a jury in the -- in the -- in the Ninth Circuit, so less than half a percent of the cases that were filed alleging retaliatory arrests have actually gone to trial, is it worth giving up the protections of 1983 for such a fundamental right as the freedom of speech right?","<speaker>Jeffrey B. Wall</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Two points. First, every similar constitutional tort claim under 1983 has an objective requirement that prevents a purely subjective inquiry into officers' motivations.

Or you could say it should wait until a state litigation process has exhausted itself. And maybe it makes sense to wait when the state has acknowledged a duty to pay, and we can say the state's probably good for it. And that's where those cases originally came from, Cherokee and some of the early ones. But maybe -- maybe it doesn't make sense when the state has denied any obligation to pay. Maybe -- maybe it makes -- maybe it is different when it's an inverse condemnation, because when we look at other -- other constitutional rights, we don't say that a First Amendment violation isn't complete until someone has litigated that claim in state court under state processes or a Fourth Amendment claim. And when you look at the history of inverse condemnation suits, they originated in common law under trespass. It's a simple claim against the state for trespass. That's what an inverse condemnation suit is. Nothing more, nothing less.

You haven't suggested that the Pennsylvania inverse condemnation system is unfair, unjust, not reasonable, not fast, not anything else, right? So your only absolute claim is ""I should have had this done in federal court, not state court,"" correct?","<speaker>Noel J. Francisco</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may -- may it please the Court: I'd like to address two basic points that I think are relevant to the discussion that we've been having here. First, Williamson County's premise was correct. The government doesn't violate the takings clause if it provides just compensation after the fact. But it erred in assuming that Section 1983 is only available to address constitutional violations. Instead, it's available to enforce the deprivation of all constitutional rights, and there's no basis for concluding that the right to just compensation is the only right that Section 1983 doesn't cover. But, second, I think you can effectively reach the same result under Section 1331 because, as this Court held in International College of Surgeons, is -- if a state cause of action asserts a federal takings claim as such, then that state cause of action arises under the Constitution for purposes of Section 1331, and so the property owner falls within the district court's original jurisdiction, and you don't have to address whether Williamson County was rightly or wrongly decided at all.</text>",2018

So why shouldn't the reverse be true, we thought. That rationale has now disappeared with incorporation. And we've since revisited a very similar -- similar issue in the Fourth Amendment context in Elkins, where we used to allow federal prosecutors to use illegally obtained evidence, and now we don't. So that rationale seems to have, in fact, changed over time. So that might be one -- one argument.

But what's -- what's -- what's quite interesting about the statistical analysis in this case is that quite a lot of it does not run off a proportional representation benchmark. In other words, all the computer simulations, all the 25,000 maps, right, really do take the political geography of the state as a given. So -- so, if Democrats are clustered and Republicans aren't, that's in the program. And all the other redistricting requirements or preferences, like contiguity, like following natural boundaries, that's all in the program. So there's -- the benchmark is not proportional representation. The benchmark is the natural political geography of the state, plus all the districting criteria, except for partisanship. And if you run those maps, right, what did you get? You got 24,000 maps and this -- and 99 percent of them, 99 plus percent of them, were on one side of the map that was picked here. All of those maps show that a 10/three configuration is not the natural one. And it's not the natural one not because it's not proportional representation.

In other words, the state can do whatever it wants, it can depart from proportional representation however much it wants to, however much the natural features of the state would suggest, it can come up with something that's not proportional representation at all.

And once we say, okay, all these other factors are controlled for, we can -- we can do a regression analysis, control for geography and all these things, we're still going to have hundreds of maps. And the legislature is going to choose one. And at that point, we have to say, what's the range of permissible options? And that -- from that, we need a baseline.
