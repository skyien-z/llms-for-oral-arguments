15841,2018.17-1091-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor,"General, yeah, that -- that is true, but that's because at a certain -- up to a certain point in our history, we didn't apply the Bill of Rights to the states. So, in all of the situations before we apply the Bill of Rights to this -- before we apply the Bill of Rights to states, they did things that, under incorporation, were unconstitutional. And in most of our cases, they were history going both ways. Some states did; some states didn't. So, really, what the issue that we have to look at isn't -- is where has our understanding come to in terms of a particular Bill of Rights? And in Austin, we said it is a long part of history that punitive sanctions cannot be excessive. And Justice Scalia said it very well: For the Eighth Amendment to limit cash fines while permitting -- permitting limitless in-kind assessments would make little sense, altering only the form of the Star Chamber abuses. So, at a certain point in Austin, we looked at what had happened to in rem forfeiture and realized that we had just changed the Star Chamber form. I -- I -- I don't actually understand your argument based on history because, without incorporation, the history's going to be what you want it to be. The real question is the fundamental right. Are we trying to avoid a society that's like the Char -- Star Chamber?

He believed they wouldn't, because of his delusions, ultimately succeed, but he understood perfectly well that set of facts. And we said that still qualified him. So we have a man here who knows that he's incarcerated or kept in a cage because he's in a bed, he can't move on his own, can't remember where the bathroom is next to him, can't see, slurs his words. He's really not quite there. But he knows that someone says he committed a murder and that they're trying to kill him, but he doesn't understand why. He can't be present enough in time to rationally understand or reflect on what he has done because he can't retain information for long. And why is that different than Panetti? In Panetti, the man was blaming someone else, which may be even worse for some people, or saying that someone else is going to protect him.

You know, one of the things that strike me -- strikes me, when I went back and -- and looked at Baze, there's a lot about kind of deference to a state legislature and state officials about determining the appropriate method of execution, about giving a kind of considered judgment to the sort of pain that would be expected from an execution, as well as their interests in carrying out legitimate sentences and making decisions on that basis. But what strikes me is that when we think about that, those officials really are thinking in gross, if you know what I mean. They're thinking about a method of execution as applied to the general class of people and deciding that it's appropriate. And what, of course, makes this case very different is that it's not in gross. It's a particular person that says I have a highly unusual condition that will make the execution highly unusual, that will have me suffer highly unusual pain. And in that context, I think all of that stuff that we talked about in Baze about why we should refer to state-considered judgments really falls away because there's been no considered judgment, surely by the legislature and, in general, by officials, about -- about one particular person.

And the second is that Congress uses the 10b-5 language after every court has decided that 10b-5 creates a private right of action.

In exchange for ceding its land, the tribe expressly reserved the right to hunt on that ceded land. The text of the 1868 treaty memorializing this agreement explicitly identifies the four events that would cause the hunting right to terminate. Wyoming's admission to the Union is not among them. Therefore, the only way that Wyoming's statehood could have terminated the hunting right is by implication, but that is the very theory that this Court repeatedly rejected in Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians.

So -- but --","<speaker>Danielle Spinelli</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code lets the trustee decide whether the estate will become a party to an executory contract of the debtor.

Rejection constitutes a breach of such contract immediately before the date of the filing of the petition. The debtor will not fulfill any remaining unperformed obligations under the contract, and the counterparty will have a prepetition claim against the debtor for any resulting damages. But that's all rejection is, the estate's decision not to take on the debtor's future performance obligations, which are therefore breached.

All sides to this case now agree that the Ninth Circuit was wrong. There is no per se rule that courts can never provide relief when a creditor violates the discharge in good faith.

This categorical rule would adopt a profoundly atextual qualified-immunity-like defense for the code, declaring that courts can never provide relief so long as a creditor can identify any fair, reasonable ground for violating the discharge. This novel proposal has no foothold in this Court's traditional principles for enforcing injunctions or the cords -- the code's broad equitable authority under Section 105. There is no per se rule that excuses subjective or objective mistakes under the code. Section 105 provides broad authority to enforce and restore the statutory discharge, and the code bars all efforts to collect discharged debts, not only unreasonable ones.

Now it appears Petitioner is really not talking about civil contempt, even though that is the question presented on which this Court granted cert. For civil contempt, we think that the text of 524 is what controls. The text of 524 says that a discharge order operates as an injunction, and not to borrow Justice Frankfurter's sort of horticultural analogy, but that brings all the old soil with it, the word ""injunction."" And so the government's position is that the ordinary rules that govern injunctions, injunctive relief, and the discipline for violating injunctive orders in the ordinary civil context apply in the bankruptcy context. Now, the Ninth Circuit below had a bankruptcy-specific rule in which good faith belief, even if unreasonable, could immunize from civil contempt.

Goldstein</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is a failure to warn case under Section 388 of the Second Restatement. That's where the principle is embodied, and that says something that ought to be uncontroversial, and that is, if you make a product and the ordinary use or maintenance of that product is going to cause a harm that you know about, then you need to warn about that. And the court of appeals here quite explicitly limited its holding to situations in which you have a product that has a part and that part is required for it to operate. And so if I could just point us to the first operative sentence of the court of appeals' opinion. It's at 2a of the Joint Appendix. It's not that long. ""The defense's basic idea"" -- this is bare-metal -- ""is that a manufacturer who delivers a product, bare-metal, that is, without the insulation or other material that must be added for the product's proper operation."" And so it is concerned only there with the case in which you just -- these machines will not work if they don't have asbestos in them. But it's worse for that -- for the defendants in terms of their liability, because as been -- as has been suggested, it is the operation and maintenance of the machine that makes the danger worse. So Justice Breyer or -- and Justice Sotomayor discussed a situation of how it is that asbestos can be on a shelf and it's not at all dangerous, but if you put it in the machine and you subject it to the temperature of 100 -- 850 degrees and you compress it and you leave it there over time, it will degrade to the point that, when you have ordinary maintenance, which is specified in the manual for the machine, and you are digging it out and chopping it up, that creates asbestos dust. Asbestos dust is a distinct danger that causes a distinct harm from asbestos as a part. And that is the concern here. And that is when you are maintaining the machine as you're supposed to, as you are directed to by the manual created by the Defendants here, you have an injury to which you are subjected. There's a pretty good illustration of that, and that's their own concession that when they ship the machine with the original gasket in it or when they provide the 992 replacement gaskets that Foster Wheeler did, who's one of the Defendants, they're liable. They recognize it's part of their machine. Maintaining their machine is creating the risk. Their responsibility for that, for warning us, telling us wear a mask in the manual, doesn't change when we get to the 993rd gasket. Now I take the kind of law and economics take on this to be, well, who's the most efficient party to warn? And I want to explain why it is that they are. But just to pause for a second, that, I think, is probably the function of maritime law here, and that is even if you disagreed with us and believed that there was a division in how the common law was applied in these circumstances, there is a special solicitude for sailors that you would say requires the warning by the manufacturers here. And if the Navy believed there was over-warning, the Navy would prohibit giving this warning. Now why are they the most efficient party to give the warning? First, it's their machine. They're much more familiar with how the parts work than the part manufacturer because the parts can be used for lots of different machines. What happens with a gasket, for example, is we'll get shipped a set of asbestos board, and it will be cut out to fit inside whatever flange or whatever pipe connection is inside the machine. The people who know how that's going to operate, how much pressure is going to be on it, is the maker of the machine. The asbestos packing, it comes off a shelf. It gets put in the machine. Now who knows how the machine will affect the asbestos? The maker of the machine. The real manufacturer that's going to point to the cases that he's citing are the makers of the asbestos replacement parts, because he says examples like, well, you know, this could be used for lots and lots of different applications. So take a maker in their mind of the asbestos gasket material or the asbestos packing. It's not necessarily going to be used on a Navy destroyer in a GE turbine. The people who know the effects of a Navy destroyer GE turbine are GE, who made the turbine. In addition --</text>",2018

There's a pretty good illustration of that, and that's their own concession that when they ship the machine with the original gasket in it or when they provide the 992 replacement gaskets that Foster Wheeler did, who's one of the Defendants, they're liable. They recognize it's part of their machine. Maintaining their machine is creating the risk. Their responsibility for that, for warning us, telling us wear a mask in the manual, doesn't change when we get to the 993rd gasket. Now I take the kind of law and economics take on this to be, well, who's the most efficient party to warn? And I want to explain why it is that they are. But just to pause for a second, that, I think, is probably the function of maritime law here, and that is even if you disagreed with us and believed that there was a division in how the common law was applied in these circumstances, there is a special solicitude for sailors that you would say requires the warning by the manufacturers here. And if the Navy believed there was over-warning, the Navy would prohibit giving this warning. Now why are they the most efficient party to give the warning? First, it's their machine. They're much more familiar with how the parts work than the part manufacturer because the parts can be used for lots of different machines. What happens with a gasket, for example, is we'll get shipped a set of asbestos board, and it will be cut out to fit inside whatever flange or whatever pipe connection is inside the machine. The people who know how that's going to operate, how much pressure is going to be on it, is the maker of the machine. The asbestos packing, it comes off a shelf. It gets put in the machine. Now who knows how the machine will affect the asbestos? The maker of the machine. The real manufacturer that's going to point to the cases that he's citing are the makers of the asbestos replacement parts, because he says examples like, well, you know, this could be used for lots and lots of different applications. So take a maker in their mind of the asbestos gasket material or the asbestos packing. It's not necessarily going to be used on a Navy destroyer in a GE turbine.

But it's worse for that -- for the defendants in terms of their liability, because as been -- as has been suggested, it is the operation and maintenance of the machine that makes the danger worse. So Justice Breyer or -- and Justice Sotomayor discussed a situation of how it is that asbestos can be on a shelf and it's not at all dangerous, but if you put it in the machine and you subject it to the temperature of 100 -- 850 degrees and you compress it and you leave it there over time, it will degrade to the point that, when you have ordinary maintenance, which is specified in the manual for the machine, and you are digging it out and chopping it up, that creates asbestos dust.

And the court of appeals here quite explicitly limited its holding to situations in which you have a product that has a part and that part is required for it to operate. And so if I could just point us to the first operative sentence of the court of appeals' opinion. It's at 2a of the Joint Appendix. It's not that long. ""The defense's basic idea"" -- this is bare-metal -- ""is that a manufacturer who delivers a product, bare-metal, that is, without the insulation or other material that must be added for the product's proper operation."" And so it is concerned only there with the case in which you just -- these machines will not work if they don't have asbestos in them. But it's worse for that -- for the defendants in terms of their liability, because as been -- as has been suggested, it is the operation and maintenance of the machine that makes the danger worse. So Justice Breyer or -- and Justice Sotomayor discussed a situation of how it is that asbestos can be on a shelf and it's not at all dangerous, but if you put it in the machine and you subject it to the temperature of 100 -- 850 degrees and you compress it and you leave it there over time, it will degrade to the point that, when you have ordinary maintenance, which is specified in the manual for the machine, and you are digging it out and chopping it up, that creates asbestos dust. Asbestos dust is a distinct danger that causes a distinct harm from asbestos as a part. And that is the concern here. And that is when you are maintaining the machine as you're supposed to, as you are directed to by the manual created by the Defendants here, you have an injury to which you are subjected. There's a pretty good illustration of that, and that's their own concession that when they ship the machine with the original gasket in it or when they provide the 992 replacement gaskets that Foster Wheeler did, who's one of the Defendants, they're liable. They recognize it's part of their machine. Maintaining their machine is creating the risk. Their responsibility for that, for warning us, telling us wear a mask in the manual, doesn't change when we get to the 993rd gasket. Now I take the kind of law and economics take on this to be, well, who's the most efficient party to warn? And I want to explain why it is that they are.

""The defense's basic idea"" -- this is bare-metal -- ""is that a manufacturer who delivers a product, bare-metal, that is, without the insulation or other material that must be added for the product's proper operation."" And so it is concerned only there with the case in which you just -- these machines will not work if they don't have asbestos in them. But it's worse for that -- for the defendants in terms of their liability, because as been -- as has been suggested, it is the operation and maintenance of the machine that makes the danger worse. So Justice Breyer or -- and Justice Sotomayor discussed a situation of how it is that asbestos can be on a shelf and it's not at all dangerous, but if you put it in the machine and you subject it to the temperature of 100 -- 850 degrees and you compress it and you leave it there over time, it will degrade to the point that, when you have ordinary maintenance, which is specified in the manual for the machine, and you are digging it out and chopping it up, that creates asbestos dust. Asbestos dust is a distinct danger that causes a distinct harm from asbestos as a part. And that is the concern here. And that is when you are maintaining the machine as you're supposed to, as you are directed to by the manual created by the Defendants here, you have an injury to which you are subjected. There's a pretty good illustration of that, and that's their own concession that when they ship the machine with the original gasket in it or when they provide the 992 replacement gaskets that Foster Wheeler did, who's one of the Defendants, they're liable. They recognize it's part of their machine. Maintaining their machine is creating the risk. Their responsibility for that, for warning us, telling us wear a mask in the manual, doesn't change when we get to the 993rd gasket. Now I take the kind of law and economics take on this to be, well, who's the most efficient party to warn? And I want to explain why it is that they are. But just to pause for a second, that, I think, is probably the function of maritime law here, and that is even if you disagreed with us and believed that there was a division in how the common law was applied in these circumstances, there is a special solicitude for sailors that you would say requires the warning by the manufacturers here. And if the Navy believed there was over-warning, the Navy would prohibit giving this warning. Now why are they the most efficient party to give the warning? First, it's their machine. They're much more familiar with how the parts work than the part manufacturer because the parts can be used for lots of different machines. What happens with a gasket, for example, is we'll get shipped a set of asbestos board, and it will be cut out to fit inside whatever flange or whatever pipe connection is inside the machine. The people who know how that's going to operate, how much pressure is going to be on it, is the maker of the machine. The asbestos packing, it comes off a shelf. It gets put in the machine. Now who knows how the machine will affect the asbestos? The maker of the machine. The real manufacturer that's going to point to the cases that he's citing are the makers of the asbestos replacement parts, because he says examples like, well, you know, this could be used for lots and lots of different applications. So take a maker in their mind of the asbestos gasket material or the asbestos packing. It's not necessarily going to be used on a Navy destroyer in a GE turbine. The people who know the effects of a Navy destroyer GE turbine are GE, who made the turbine. In addition --</text>",2018
