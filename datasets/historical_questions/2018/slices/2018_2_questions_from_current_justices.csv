The government said that (d) is the more specific provision and the nature of the comprehensiveness, as the Chief Justice indicated, for purposes of pre-enactment offenders was that the Attorney General gets to decide, and the Attorney General could decide to do nothing, the government said, the Attorney General could decide to include some offenders, none of the offenders, or all of the pre-enactment offenders. The government said that it could then determine which of the Act provisions it wished to, in a Chinese menu manner, apply to these people it had chosen. The government then said the Attorney General could change his or her mind about all of this at any given time.

Or you could say it should wait until a state litigation process has exhausted itself. And maybe it makes sense to wait when the state has acknowledged a duty to pay, and we can say the state's probably good for it. And that's where those cases originally came from, Cherokee and some of the early ones. But maybe -- maybe it doesn't make sense when the state has denied any obligation to pay. Maybe -- maybe it makes -- maybe it is different when it's an inverse condemnation, because when we look at other -- other constitutional rights, we don't say that a First Amendment violation isn't complete until someone has litigated that claim in state court under state processes or a Fourth Amendment claim. And when you look at the history of inverse condemnation suits, they originated in common law under trespass. It's a simple claim against the state for trespass.

So your only absolute claim is ""I should have had this done in federal court, not state court,"" correct?","<speaker>Noel J. Francisco</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may -- may it please the Court: I'd like to address two basic points that I think are relevant to the discussion that we've been having here. First, Williamson County's premise was correct. The government doesn't violate the takings clause if it provides just compensation after the fact. But it erred in assuming that Section 1983 is only available to address constitutional violations. Instead, it's available to enforce the deprivation of all constitutional rights, and there's no basis for concluding that the right to just compensation is the only right that Section 1983 doesn't cover. But, second, I think you can effectively reach the same result under Section 1331 because, as this Court held in International College of Surgeons, is -- if a state cause of action asserts a federal takings claim as such, then that state cause of action arises under the Constitution for purposes of Section 1331, and so the property owner falls within the district court's original jurisdiction, and you don't have to address whether Williamson County was rightly or wrongly decided at all.</text>",2018

One was incorporation, and we were concerned that the federal government would be at a disadvantage compared to states without this rule because states were not bound then by the Double Jeopardy Clause and could pursue a second prosecution after a failed federal prosecution. So why shouldn't the reverse be true, we thought. That rationale has now disappeared with incorporation. And we've since revisited a very similar -- similar issue in the Fourth Amendment context in Elkins, where we used to allow federal prosecutors to use illegally obtained evidence, and now we don't. So that rationale seems to have, in fact, changed over time. So that might be one -- one argument. And then -- and then the other is, again, with the -- with the -- in Bartkus, we relied on the -- on the -- and elsewhere on -- on the promise that prosecutors wouldn't do this in routine cases.

Michel</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: More than 70 years ago, in United States versus California, this Court clarified the federal government's paramount sovereignty over the continental shelf. Congress reinforced that interest throughout OCSLA, including its choice of law provision. Now, unlike a typical choice of law provision, Section 1333 of OCSLA does not direct a choice between two bodies of law. Instead, it creates one body of law, a body of federal law, and it adopts state law as ""the law of the United States"" to the the extent it is applicable and not inconsistent with other federal law. Now, as this Court and virtually every other court has recognized for 50 years, those words refer to gap-filling in federal law. Respondent's position, by contrast, would essentially replicate the position on mainland California on the Outer Continental Shelf, with the small exception that federal officials would enforce the law, which we think is inconsistent with the text, the purpose, and the history of -- of OCSLA.</text>",2018

But what's -- what's -- what's quite interesting about the statistical analysis in this case is that quite a lot of it does not run off a proportional representation benchmark. In other words, all the computer simulations, all the 25,000 maps, right, really do take the political geography of the state as a given. So -- so, if Democrats are clustered and Republicans aren't, that's in the program. And all the other redistricting requirements or preferences, like contiguity, like following natural boundaries, that's all in the program. So there's -- the benchmark is not proportional representation. The benchmark is the natural political geography of the state, plus all the districting criteria, except for partisanship. And if you run those maps, right, what did you get? You got 24,000 maps and this -- and 99 percent of them, 99 plus percent of them, were on one side of the map that was picked here. All of those maps show that a 10/three configuration is not the natural one. And it's not the natural one not because it's not proportional representation.
