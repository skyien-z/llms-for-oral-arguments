Gershengorn</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress provided extensive substantive and procedural protections for aliens whom the government wishes to remove, but at the same time, addressed the real concerns about recidivism and flight risk by providing for mandatory detention during removal proceedings for certain categories of criminal aliens and aliens arriving at our shores. The Ninth Circuit undid that legislative balance, invoking principles of constitutional avoidance to require the government to release those aliens unless the government can prove by a preponderance of the evidence every six months that detention remains necessary. The Ninth Circuit's decision is a serious misuse of the constitutional avoidance canon. With respect to arriving aliens, there is no constitutional problem to avoid. As even the Ninth Circuit recognized, the statute is constitutional in the vast majority of applications, and any concerns about outlier cases involving lawful permanent residents can be dressed in as-applied challenges. And with respect to criminal aliens, the text of the statute forecloses the Ninth Circuit's approach, and in any event, the statute is constitutional as written under this Court's decision in Demore. The net result of the Ninth Circuit's one-size-fits-all rule is -- is a regime that's at odds with the text that Congress enacted. It undermines DHS's enforcement priorities, and it creates incentives for individual aliens to delay their removal proceedings.</text>",2017

First, with respect to the pleading standards, it's critical to understand that police officers must concededly take account of speech when deciding whether to arrest in many situations.

The four that I wrote down were pleading standards, qualified immunity, Mt. Healthy, and a distinction between felonies or major crimes and other crimes. First, with respect to the pleading standards, it's critical to understand that police officers must concededly take account of speech when deciding whether to arrest in many situations. The bar example is one of those. And police officers need to have an objective -- an objective basis on which their conduct will be judged. It is virtually impossible for police officers themselves in the bar kind of situation to disaggregate their own thought processes and understand whether -- and re-create after the fact, certainly, whether they carried out an arrest because of the -- the content of somebody's speech and their dislike for it, or because the content of somebody's speech suggested belligerence and suggested a likelihood to continue to incite violence and there was a need to arrest in order to contain the situation. The problem with a pleading standard rule, as the Ninth Circuit demonstrates, is that there are many cases in which police officers and arrestees simply have a different view of what happened. And the Ninth Circuit sends those cases to juries, and, regularly, the juries ultimately find for the police officers but only after they've been forced to endure all of the burdens of litigation.</text>",2017

And what we understand the Second Circuit to have done -- and this is the clearest in Footnote 10 of its opinion on page 30a -- is to say that when a foreign government presents its views about the construction of its laws to a U.S. court, the U.S. court is bound to defer if that construction is facially reasonable and the U.S. court cannot look behind that construction to things like contradictory statements in other fora or to other relevant materials on foreign law that cast doubt on the foreign sovereign's representation. And we think that was a serious error. And we think it's reflected in the way that this case has unfolded. The district court, at the motion to dismiss stage, said I have the Ministry's brief, it's due deference, but I still have questions and I need more information. It then developed at the summary judgment stage a lengthy analysis of all of the different things that it believed bore on the relevant question of Chinese law. That analysis runs to some 50 pages. And the Second Circuit said, in that footnote that I referenced earlier, that the district court's consideration of that material would have been ""entirely appropriate"" had the Ministry not appeared in this case. But the Second Circuit believed that because the Ministry had appeared, that inquiry and that analysis of the Ministry's other statements and of the other evidence wasn't appropriate. And, therefore, the Second Circuit didn't consider any of that and so hasn't adjudicated a lot of the debates about the meaning of Chinese law that the parties are now trying to have before you in the first instance.</text>",2017

Fletcher</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I could start with Justice Sotomayor's question to my colleague about where the Second Circuit went wrong. I think it's useful to distinguish between what we see as two related but distinct mistakes that the Second Circuit made. One of them relates to how much weight or deference a federal court should have given to a submission like the Ministry's amicus brief in this case, and that's the question that the parties have really focused on. And I do want to explain why we think that the standard that the Second Circuit articulated is -- is too rigid and too deferential to foreign sovereign submissions. But there's another important mistake that we think the Second Circuit made. And on that, we think my friends on this side of the table actually really aren't defending what the Second Circuit has done, and that is in defining what's the universe of materials that a U.S. court can consider in applying the appropriate standard of deference in assessing the foreign government's submission and ultimately in determining what foreign law is. And what we understand the Second Circuit to have done -- and this is the clearest in Footnote 10 of its opinion on page 30a -- is to say that when a foreign government presents its views about the construction of its laws to a U.S. court, the U.S. court is bound to defer if that construction is facially reasonable and the U.S. court cannot look behind that construction to things like contradictory statements in other fora or to other relevant materials on foreign law that cast doubt on the foreign sovereign's representation. And we think that was a serious error. And we think it's reflected in the way that this case has unfolded. The district court, at the motion to dismiss stage, said I have the Ministry's brief, it's due deference, but I still have questions and I need more information. It then developed at the summary judgment stage a lengthy analysis of all of the different things that it believed bore on the relevant question of Chinese law. That analysis runs to some 50 pages. And the Second Circuit said, in that footnote that I referenced earlier, that the district court's consideration of that material would have been ""entirely appropriate"" had the Ministry not appeared in this case. But the Second Circuit believed that because the Ministry had appeared, that inquiry and that analysis of the Ministry's other statements and of the other evidence wasn't appropriate. And, therefore, the Second Circuit didn't consider any of that and so hasn't adjudicated a lot of the debates about the meaning of Chinese law that the parties are now trying to have before you in the first instance.</text>",2017

Strauss</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me first pick up on a piece of the legislative history that my friend quoted to the Court. Senator Specter, who introduced the precursor of what became 1610(g), did say that, as -- as Mr. Perlin said, that the provision was designed to eliminate many of the barriers which are preventing U.S. citizens from collecting on court-ordered damages. He then said it does this by changing the legal standard of the Bancec doctrine. So that was the way in which this exposed more assets -- more property to execution by terrorism plaintiffs. In fact, the Petitioners' position about the construction of 1610(g) is wrong for four independently sufficient reasons. One is the language the Court has focused on, ""as provided in this section."" This section, is Section 1610, that is the section of which (g) is a subsection. So the phrase ""as provided in this section"" means the Petitioners have to satisfy the provisions of 1610, which means that only property used for commercial activity in the United States can be seized. And Petitioners, I think, have just not come up with a plausible alternative account of what ""as provided in this section"" means. But there's a second reason. And it has to do with the difference between subsection (g) and the provisions of subsection 1610 that really do abrogate sovereign immunity. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act says, in Section 1609, that the property of foreign states in the U.S. shall be immune from attachment, except as provided in 1610. Then the subsections of 1610 say in terms one after another that certain property shall not be immune. Subsection (a) says that, as does (b), as does (d), as does (e). Subsection (g) contains no such language. The relevant part of subsection (g) does not refer to immunity at all. And there's a reason for that.

And I think it's easiest to understand if you're looking directly at it, 77p, subsection (c), on page 1a of the red brief.

From the very beginning, Smith, for example, basically said the disclosure at issue doesn't disclose the content of the conversation. As the dissent pointed out, the provider had access to the -- to the content of the conversation. Yet, we drew a line in saying cell phone numbers -- telephone numbers are disclosable because everybody knows that the telephone company is keeping track of those numbers. You get it in your phone bill at the end of each month. But we said people don't know or even if they realize that the phone company can listen in to their conversation, that there's a reasonable expectation that the phone company won't, absent some urgent circumstance, a death threat, almost a special needs circumstance. That suggests, as you started to say earlier, that it never was an absolute rule, the third-party doctrine. We limited it when -- in Bond and Ferguson when we said police can't get your medical records without your consent, even though you've disclosed your medical records to doctors at a hospital.

Well, and the Court said no because you expose what your bag looks like, but you don't have an expectation that people are going to touch your bag.

We look to this broad class of people who are in this situation. And if that's true -- I mean, I guess I had sort of conceptualized your argument as the exact opposite. Well, we don't know anything about Mr. Sveen, so even if it's true that people generally want to give their life insurance policy to their children, that doesn't matter because we don't know that about Mr. Sveen.
