You're already saying it's not a gross abuse of discretion or otherwise you would be appealing. So you're not doing that.

Rejecting your argument that the substantial assistance has to start from the amended guideline down, let's assume we accept the government, and the 11 circuits who have ruled this way, that it has to start from the statutory minimum. But assume further that some of those circuits have said that the court can't even consider the guideline range in determining how much of a discount to give, and that was wrong. That, as with all factors, a district court can consider what it wants in determining, for all the reasons I said earlier, how much of a discount to give can be informed by the guideline range in some way. Where would that put your clients? Because it's -- I'm not clear that -- and to be frank with you, it wasn't something I was paying attention to when I read the sentencing transcripts.

And if you tell somebody, well, because of a typo, the guy is going to stay in jail for six more months, people will say, well, that's not -- that's not fair. On the other hand, I don't think that takes into account there is cost associated with that, which is the -- the remedy is you send it back for another sentencing hearing, who knows how long, how much time has passed. The judge has to reconstruct the whole operation. And that's caused by your client's failure to object when he should have objected. So why doesn't it make sense to say that it kind of makes a difference, if you're talking about a relatively insignificant amount of time -- any day in jail is not insignificant -- but there's a difference between an error that results in an additional six months and an error that results in an additional five years.

6009,2017.16-9493-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mrs. Davidson -- Ms. Davidson, I think of the three prongs, the third and the fourth prong, the third prong as being fairness of process: Were you given the process that you were entitled to constitutionally or statutorily? And so, on the third prong, we've had many cases where elements were not given to a jury. This is neither case. We've had Cotton, where a drug amount wasn't given to a jury. We look at that third prong as a substantial deprivation of some form of constitutional or state right. I think of the fourth prong as fairness of the ultimate outcome, which is very different because often, like in Cotton, where an element like drug amount wasn't given to a jury, we look at the quantum of evidence and say: Would the outcome have been different? And that's most of our cases. Was the area -- error so substantial that the outcome was actually unfair? And so, for me, that fourth prong does serve even in sentencing guidelines a different function. It talks -- our third-prong finding is that the fairness of a judge's process of considering your sentence from a correct guideline was frustrated.

So, in order to allow the -- the case -- the claim to be filed after the statute of limitations has run, it has to fit within the doctrine of equitable tolling.

The dual office-holding ban incorporates this distinction, prohibiting active-duty military officers from holding a second office that requires nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate absent express congressional authorization, while generally allowing military officers to be assigned to exercise the duties of such positions. That's why when the four judges at issue here began to serve as appointed judges on the CMCR, the Court of Military Commission Review, it violated the dual office-holding ban and disqualified them from hearing the Petitioners' appeals.

We're talking about two cases, same lawyers, same parties, but consolidation can come up in a situation and often does when there are 100 separate cases, a mass tort situation. And there, one waiting for the final judgment can be a very long wait and it could be very prejudicial. I mean, let's say it's in some sort of mass tort and some of the people have, you know, emotional distress damages, others physical injury, and early on the judge says, look, I don't think you can recover emotional distress. So all the cases that just have emotional distress, judgment is entered against them. Now let's go on to the other thing which is going to take five years.

It provides a bright-line rule that brooks no exception. When a final judgment is entered, you have a right of appeal. Second, Rule 42 does not merge cases. There's a careful architecture in the federal rules from Rules 13 through Rule 24 designed to bring cases that should be tried as one case together.

Shanmugam</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Dodd-Frank Act provides incentives to and protections for whistleblowers; that is, individuals who have reported securities law violations to the SEC. The question presented in this case is whether the statutory definition of whistleblower applies to the subsection of the statute that protects whistleblowers from retaliation for engaging in certain types of conduct. The answer to that question is yes. By its plain terms, the statutory definition applies to the entirety of the section, including the anti-retaliation provision. Far from being absurd, that plain text interpretation is entirely consistent with the history and the structure of the whistleblower provisions and with Congress's overarching objective of promoting reporting to the SEC. It also preserves the balance between the Dodd-Frank Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which already provides broad protections to whistleblowers who report internally. And even if the statute were somehow ambiguous, the SEC's interpretation is not entitled to deference because its rule-making was procedurally defective. This Court should reject the interpretation of the Ninth Circuit, and it should reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit in this case. Now, by its terms, the Dodd-Frank Act's anti-retaliation provision prohibits retaliation only against a particular category of persons; namely, whistleblowers. And the statutory definition of whistleblower, again by its terms, applies in this section. That section, of course, indisputably includes the anti-retaliation provision, as well as the award provisions. And, therefore, the anti-retaliation provision only applies to individuals who meet the statutory definition of whistleblower; again, individuals who have reported securities law violations to the SEC. Now, as I said at the outset, we believe that that's consistent with the history, structure, and objectives of the whistleblower provisions. As to the history, perhaps the most telling fact is the fact that an earlier version of the anti-retaliation provision reached all employees. Congress then amended the provision to apply to a narrower set of individuals, whistleblowers. As to the structure of these provisions, in our view, the anti-retaliation provision protects the very class of persons to whom the award provisions provide incentives, and, therefore, the anti-retaliation provision in a very real sense works hand-and-glove with the anti-retaliation -- with the award provisions.</text>",2017

But there you are, you have this definitional provision, and it says what it says. And it says it applies to this section. And you have to have a really, really severe anomaly to get over that.

Shanmugam</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Dodd-Frank Act provides incentives to and protections for whistleblowers; that is, individuals who have reported securities law violations to the SEC. The question presented in this case is whether the statutory definition of whistleblower applies to the subsection of the statute that protects whistleblowers from retaliation for engaging in certain types of conduct. The answer to that question is yes. By its plain terms, the statutory definition applies to the entirety of the section, including the anti-retaliation provision. Far from being absurd, that plain text interpretation is entirely consistent with the history and the structure of the whistleblower provisions and with Congress's overarching objective of promoting reporting to the SEC. It also preserves the balance between the Dodd-Frank Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which already provides broad protections to whistleblowers who report internally. And even if the statute were somehow ambiguous, the SEC's interpretation is not entitled to deference because its rule-making was procedurally defective. This Court should reject the interpretation of the Ninth Circuit, and it should reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit in this case. Now, by its terms, the Dodd-Frank Act's anti-retaliation provision prohibits retaliation only against a particular category of persons; namely, whistleblowers. And the statutory definition of whistleblower, again by its terms, applies in this section.

As to the history, perhaps the most telling fact is the fact that an earlier version of the anti-retaliation provision reached all employees. Congress then amended the provision to apply to a narrower set of individuals, whistleblowers. As to the structure of these provisions, in our view, the anti-retaliation provision protects the very class of persons to whom the award provisions provide incentives, and, therefore, the anti-retaliation provision in a very real sense works hand-and-glove with the anti-retaliation -- with the award provisions.</text>",2017

It appears as if what you're -- you're reading is that the failure to vote is enough evidence to suggest that someone has moved. That seems to be your position because it can be the only one. But is that a reasonable effort to draw that conclusion when you do results in disenfranchising, disproportionately, certain cities where large groups of minorities live, where large groups of homeless people live, and across the country they're the group that votes the least, in -- in large measure because many of them work very long hours. And without the golden week that Ohio rescinded, many of them can't vote because the polls are not open while they're not working. Places like Cleveland have very, very, very long lines of -- of voter -- of voters trying to vote. All of these impediments result in large numbers of people not voting in certain spots in the state. So if the word ""reasonable effort"" has any meaning with a Congress who said that the failure to vote is a constitutional right, how can we read this statute to permit you to begin a process of disenfranchising solely on the basis of that with no independent evidence whatsoever that the person has moved? You can use the Post Office. They tell you that. You can use Certified Mail. You could use juror change of addresses. You can use driver license, motor vehicle change of addresses. There are dozens of other ways that you could verify a change of address, yet you're suggesting that using a failure to appear at an election or elections as evidence of moving when people have a right not to vote if they choose. Many have. And others like the veteran who's a plaintiff in this case explains the reasons why he failed to vote in two elections. I have to give the meaning, the words that Congress said, don't use the failure to vote as a result -- that results in someone being disenfranchised.

But if we are going to impose a standard on the courts, it has to be something that's manageable and it has to be something that's sufficiently concrete so that the public reaction to decisions is not going to be the one that the Chief Justice mentioned, that this three-judge court decided this, that -- this way because two of the three were appointed by a Republican president or two of the three were appointed by a Democratic president. Now, it's been 30 years since Bandemer, and before then and since then, judges, scholars, legal scholars, political scientists have been looking for a manageable standard. All right. In 2014, a young researcher publishes a paper, Eric McGhee publishes a paper, in which he says that the measures that were previously -- the leading measures previously, symmetry and responsiveness, are inadequate. But I have discovered the key. I have discovered the Rosetta stone and it's -- it is the efficiency gap. And then a year later you bring this suit and you say: There it is, that is the constitutional standard. It's been finally -- after 200 years, it's been finally discovered in this paper by a young researcher, who concludes in the end -- this is the end of his paper -- after saying symmetry and responsiveness have shown to be -- looked to be inappropriate, ""The measure I have offered here, relative wasted votes, is arguably"" -- arguably -- ""a more valid and flexible measure of -- of partisan -- of partisan gerrymandering."" Now, is this -- is this the time for us to jump into this? Has there been a great body of scholarship that has tested this efficiency gap? It's full of questions. Mr. McGhee's own amicus brief outlines numerous unanswered questions with -- with this theory. What do you do in -- in elections that are not contested? Well, then you have to -- you have to make two guesses. How many people would have voted for the winning candidate if it had been a contested election? How many people would have voted for the losing candidate if it had been a contested election? One of the judges in the court below asks: Why do you calculate EG by map, by subtracting from the votes obtained by the winner, 50 percent of the votes, instead of the votes obtained by the runner up? And Mr. McGhee says: Well, I have an answer to this, and I have a forthcoming paper and I'll answer it in the forthcoming paper.

This is the Alexander Hamilton quote from the Federalist Papers: ""It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable"" to suit without consent. The immovable property exception is an exception that applies to other sovereigns, but that's because an exception to that general rule has been made. In the United States, the political branches control whether there are exceptions to that general rule of sovereign immunity from suit for the United States, for foreign states, and for Indian tribes.</text>",2017

Gershengorn</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress provided extensive substantive and procedural protections for aliens whom the government wishes to remove, but at the same time, addressed the real concerns about recidivism and flight risk by providing for mandatory detention during removal proceedings for certain categories of criminal aliens and aliens arriving at our shores. The Ninth Circuit undid that legislative balance, invoking principles of constitutional avoidance to require the government to release those aliens unless the government can prove by a preponderance of the evidence every six months that detention remains necessary. The Ninth Circuit's decision is a serious misuse of the constitutional avoidance canon. With respect to arriving aliens, there is no constitutional problem to avoid. As even the Ninth Circuit recognized, the statute is constitutional in the vast majority of applications, and any concerns about outlier cases involving lawful permanent residents can be dressed in as-applied challenges. And with respect to criminal aliens, the text of the statute forecloses the Ninth Circuit's approach, and in any event, the statute is constitutional as written under this Court's decision in Demore. The net result of the Ninth Circuit's one-size-fits-all rule is -- is a regime that's at odds with the text that Congress enacted. It undermines DHS's enforcement priorities, and it creates incentives for individual aliens to delay their removal proceedings.</text>",2017

First, with respect to the pleading standards, it's critical to understand that police officers must concededly take account of speech when deciding whether to arrest in many situations. The bar example is one of those. And police officers need to have an objective -- an objective basis on which their conduct will be judged.

And what we understand the Second Circuit to have done -- and this is the clearest in Footnote 10 of its opinion on page 30a -- is to say that when a foreign government presents its views about the construction of its laws to a U.S. court, the U.S. court is bound to defer if that construction is facially reasonable and the U.S. court cannot look behind that construction to things like contradictory statements in other fora or to other relevant materials on foreign law that cast doubt on the foreign sovereign's representation.

And on that, we think my friends on this side of the table actually really aren't defending what the Second Circuit has done, and that is in defining what's the universe of materials that a U.S. court can consider in applying the appropriate standard of deference in assessing the foreign government's submission and ultimately in determining what foreign law is. And what we understand the Second Circuit to have done -- and this is the clearest in Footnote 10 of its opinion on page 30a -- is to say that when a foreign government presents its views about the construction of its laws to a U.S. court, the U.S. court is bound to defer if that construction is facially reasonable and the U.S. court cannot look behind that construction to things like contradictory statements in other fora or to other relevant materials on foreign law that cast doubt on the foreign sovereign's representation. And we think that was a serious error. And we think it's reflected in the way that this case has unfolded. The district court, at the motion to dismiss stage, said I have the Ministry's brief, it's due deference, but I still have questions and I need more information. It then developed at the summary judgment stage a lengthy analysis of all of the different things that it believed bore on the relevant question of Chinese law. That analysis runs to some 50 pages. And the Second Circuit said, in that footnote that I referenced earlier, that the district court's consideration of that material would have been ""entirely appropriate"" had the Ministry not appeared in this case. But the Second Circuit believed that because the Ministry had appeared, that inquiry and that analysis of the Ministry's other statements and of the other evidence wasn't appropriate. And, therefore, the Second Circuit didn't consider any of that and so hasn't adjudicated a lot of the debates about the meaning of Chinese law that the parties are now trying to have before you in the first instance.</text>",2017

Strauss</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me first pick up on a piece of the legislative history that my friend quoted to the Court. Senator Specter, who introduced the precursor of what became 1610(g), did say that, as -- as Mr. Perlin said, that the provision was designed to eliminate many of the barriers which are preventing U.S. citizens from collecting on court-ordered damages. He then said it does this by changing the legal standard of the Bancec doctrine. So that was the way in which this exposed more assets -- more property to execution by terrorism plaintiffs. In fact, the Petitioners' position about the construction of 1610(g) is wrong for four independently sufficient reasons. One is the language the Court has focused on, ""as provided in this section."" This section, is Section 1610, that is the section of which (g) is a subsection. So the phrase ""as provided in this section"" means the Petitioners have to satisfy the provisions of 1610, which means that only property used for commercial activity in the United States can be seized. And Petitioners, I think, have just not come up with a plausible alternative account of what ""as provided in this section"" means. But there's a second reason. And it has to do with the difference between subsection (g) and the provisions of subsection 1610 that really do abrogate sovereign immunity. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act says, in Section 1609, that the property of foreign states in the U.S. shall be immune from attachment, except as provided in 1610. Then the subsections of 1610 say in terms one after another that certain property shall not be immune. Subsection (a) says that, as does (b), as does (d), as does (e). Subsection (g) contains no such language. The relevant part of subsection (g) does not refer to immunity at all. And there's a reason for that.

And that's why I -- I'm differentiating between incident-related searches and basically dragnet searches when you're looking at what a person is doing over 127, 30, 40, even 24 hours, which is it's not related to any legitimate police need to invade the privacy of a person over a 24-hour period, unless there's a suggestion that the crime occurred during that entire 24-hour period. So that's why I asked you is there a difference between saying if police have cause to believe a crime has been committed, can they ask for records related to that individual crime, even if it happened on one day, a second day, a fourth day, a 10th day, so long as they're limiting their search as related to a criminal activity, as opposed to a dragnet sweep of everybody's intimate details? Because right now we're only talking about the cell sites records, but as I understand it, a cell phone can be pinged in your bedroom. It can be pinged at your doctor's office. It can ping you in the most intimate details of your life. Presumably at some point even in a dressing room as you're undressing. So I am not beyond the belief that someday a provider could turn on my cell phone and listen to my conversations. So I'm not sure where your 24-hour rule comes from. Shouldn't your rule be based on incident-related rather than the essence of your complaint, which is that we're permitting police to do a dragnet search of your life?","<speaker>Nathan Freed Wessler</speaker><text>Thank you.

From the very beginning, Smith, for example, basically said the disclosure at issue doesn't disclose the content of the conversation. As the dissent pointed out, the provider had access to the -- to the content of the conversation. Yet, we drew a line in saying cell phone numbers -- telephone numbers are disclosable because everybody knows that the telephone company is keeping track of those numbers. You get it in your phone bill at the end of each month. But we said people don't know or even if they realize that the phone company can listen in to their conversation, that there's a reasonable expectation that the phone company won't, absent some urgent circumstance, a death threat, almost a special needs circumstance. That suggests, as you started to say earlier, that it never was an absolute rule, the third-party doctrine. We limited it when -- in Bond and Ferguson when we said police can't get your medical records without your consent, even though you've disclosed your medical records to doctors at a hospital. They can't touch your bag to feel what's in your bag because an individual may disclose his or her bag to the public. I think one of my colleagues here said you can -- why shouldn't people expect others to touch their bag as well? Well, and the Court said no because you expose what your bag looks like, but you don't have an expectation that people are going to touch your bag.

If it's not in the curtilage -- curtilage, then it's not a search of the home, the Fourth Amendment doesn't apply. But once you get beyond that, it is a search of the home, the ultimate Fourth Amendment question is always: Is it a reasonable search? And that's where we are here. Is it reasonable? It's a balancing of interests. That's what reasonableness meant in -- at the end of the 18th century; it's what it means today. And so you have to grapple with the real privacy interests that are involved in the case versus the other considerations; namely, the mobility of the automobile.

We look to this broad class of people who are in this situation. And if that's true -- I mean, I guess I had sort of conceptualized your argument as the exact opposite. Well, we don't know anything about Mr. Sveen, so even if it's true that people generally want to give their life insurance policy to their children, that doesn't matter because we don't know that about Mr. Sveen.
