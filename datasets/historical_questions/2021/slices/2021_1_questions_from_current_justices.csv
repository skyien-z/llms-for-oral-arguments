Alito, Jr.","What if the only thing counsel said was, we'd like this testing, we really don't know what claims we might bring, and we really don't know how the testing might assist any claims that we might bring, but we just want to see whether anything pops up? Is that enough?","<speaker>Benjamin M. Flowers</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Jackson long ago warned against giving the convict population of the country new and unprecedented opportunities to litigate until they serve their sentences or make the best of increased opportunities to escape. The Sixth Circuit here blessed precisely the sort of opportunity he warned of. It held that when a federal statute prohibits ordering a prisoner's transportation with a writ of habeas corpus, courts may instead order transportation under the All Writs Act. But courts have no such power. Every All Writs order must be agreeable to the usages and principles of law, meaning the traditional writs as altered by statute. Transportation orders must be agreeable to habeas law because habeas writs were the only traditional writs used for ordering the transportation of prisoners. So, when a federal habeas statute prohibits ordering transportation with a writ of habeas corpus in a particular situation, courts may not evade that prohibition by issuing a transportation order under the All Writs Act. But the order here was improper for a second reason regardless. Every All Writs Act order must be necessary or appropriate in aid of the issuing court's jurisdiction. The order here doesn't qualify because it evades the rules governing discovery in habeas cases and facilitates the development of evidence that no habeas court can even consider. All that leaves only the question whether the circuit had jurisdiction in this case, and it did. The warden satisfied all three elements of the collateral order doctrine. First, the order here is conclusive. Second, the question whether the All Writs Act empowers a federal court to interfere with the sovereign's management of its own prisons is both important and separate from the merits. And, finally, the state cannot -- states cannot meaningfully protect themselves from transportation orders unless they're allowed to appeal immediately. Regardless, the warden moved in the alternative for mandamus relief. If the Court thinks the collateral order doctrine doesn't apply, it should remand with instructions to issue a writ of mandamus correcting the district court's egregiously wrong and dangerous decision.

Are you pursuing both now, or are you pursuing them separately, or is this sort of a hybrid claim argument you're making?","<speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Coach Kennedy took a knee at midfield after games to say a brief prayer of thanks, his expression was entirely his own. That private religious expression was doubly protected by the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses. When the School District fired him for that fleeting religious exercise out of endorsement concerns, it not only violated the First Amendment, but it -- it ignored a veritable wall of this Court's precedents that make clear that a school does not endorse private religious speech just because it fails to censure it. As much as the District would like to change the subject, the record is clear that Coach Kennedy was fired for that midfield prayer, not for any earlier practices. And the record is equally clear that the District's sole reason for its actions was out of endorsement concerns, not concerns for band members' safety or how many players joined the coach in the prayer. In fact, Coach Kennedy was disciplined for events at two games in particular, October 23 and October 26. At the first of those games, it is undisputed that no one joined the coach in his prayer. Nonetheless, that solo prayer was Exhibit A in his firing. Exhibit B was the October 26 game, when no players joined him in the prayer. Yet, nonetheless, the District, throughout this case, both contemporaneously and to the EEOC and in deposition, has confirmed that the sole driving force behind its actions has been avoiding endorsement. The Ninth Circuit held that the District's actions not only comply with the First Amendment but are compelled by it. That decision is flatly inconsistent with this Court's precedents. The Ninth Circuit's government speech holding ignores this Court's statement in Garcetti that -- that -- to avoid overly broad job descriptions. And the Ninth Circuit's Establishment Clause holding fails to grasp a basic teaching of this Court's cases that has been said over and over again and is simple enough for even young students to understand, that the government does not endorse all private religious speech just because it takes place on the school side of the gates.

7977,2021.21-418-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"But why does it have to be a neutral rule? Meaning -- and -- and this is why I'm getting to this example. She's on duty. She's on duty in the classroom. And the duty is not from the beginning of the bell to the end of the bell. The duty is while she's in the classroom. So why can't an employer tell an employee what they're permitted to do, personal or otherwise, during that time? And I ask this question because I'm analogizing it to this situation. I found it odd in your brief that you just kept saying the coach wasn't on the field during the game. But I have a dozen or more statements by your coach telling and admitting that his duties as coach didn't -- weren't just during the game. He had an obligation to remain behind for two hours after the game finished. That was part of his duties. He had a duty to make sure that he escorted all the players off the field. He had a duty to make sure the other team got off the field. He had a duty to do a post-game wrap-up both with the players and the coach. He had a duty to clean up and to make sure that the gym was left in good order. So I guess what I'm asking is, if he had all these duties and your employer says to you, these are the duties that you have and that's all I want you to do, why can't it choose to say, and the one duty I don't want you to do is to do this one because you are an example to your players? You admit that that's part of your duties. If it's not part of his duties to set the example the school wants, why can't the school fire a coach who decides to put a Nazi swastika on their arm and go to the middle of the field and pray?

9883,2021.20-5279-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas,"Ms. Ross, is there any way using either your test or Petitioner's test to avoid fact-finding that seems to run the risk of involving us with the Sixth Amendment?","<speaker>Erica L. Ross</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Contrary to Petitioner's suggestion, the government's rule is faithful to the text and it does not depend on synchronicity between the final elements of different crimes. Rather, two crimes are committed on occasions different from one another when their essential conduct elements are satisfied by different acts. That reflects the statute's text. If the same act satisfies an element of two different crimes, then the commission of each offense is not a different occasion, that is, a different event, occurrence, or happening. The government's test also furthers the statute's purpose because it separates defendants who have been held criminally responsible for multiple discrete acts from those who have been held responsible for a single act that resulted in several statutory violations. Now I agree with my friend that in the vast majority of cases we can apply -- we can decide this question pretty easily. On our test, they can be resolved by a simple rule of thumb. If one offense is over before the next begins, then the two are committed on different occasions because their essential elements are necessarily accomplished through different acts. Two examples illustrate the point. First, if a defendant burglarizes ten houses on the same street, those are necessarily ten different occasions. He could not have unlawfully entered each home through one act, and he had the choice not to commit another crime between each one. Second, if a defendant robs ten people in one place with the same stick-up, as in Petty, that one act marks only one occasion. As I think has become clear this morning, Petitioner's freewheeling approach would be much more difficult to apply. He would require courts to seek to identify the juncture of circumstances that gave rise to the relevant criminal opportunity. But none of that language is in the text, and Petitioner's rule would require courts to examine granular facts that state court records often will not include. Petitioner's approach also would yield inconsistent results. Different judges will have different intuitions about what -- when one occasion ends and another begins. This Court should reject Petitioner's invitation to uncertainty and inconsistency and affirm.</text>",2021

And, of course, we would have to look at each one to see if it's a different occasion. And I guess, at some point, we'd have to figure out what documents we look at in determining whether a particular element was -- was present, and that, you say, will avoid inconsistent results across the country.

Ross</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Contrary to Petitioner's suggestion, the government's rule is faithful to the text and it does not depend on synchronicity between the final elements of different crimes. Rather, two crimes are committed on occasions different from one another when their essential conduct elements are satisfied by different acts. That reflects the statute's text. If the same act satisfies an element of two different crimes, then the commission of each offense is not a different occasion, that is, a different event, occurrence, or happening. The government's test also furthers the statute's purpose because it separates defendants who have been held criminally responsible for multiple discrete acts from those who have been held responsible for a single act that resulted in several statutory violations. Now I agree with my friend that in the vast majority of cases we can apply -- we can decide this question pretty easily. On our test, they can be resolved by a simple rule of thumb.

So how do you distinguish your case from the express language in Ex parte Young?","<speaker>Marc A. Hearron</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In enacting Senate Bill 8, the Texas legislature not only deliberately prohibited the exercise of a constitutional right recognized by this Court, it did everything it could to evade effective judicial protection of that right in federal or state court. Texas delegated enforcement to literally any person anywhere except its own state officials. The only conceivable reason for doing so was to evade federal court review under Ex parte Young. Texas then created special rules applicable only to S.B. 8 claims that make it all but impossible to protect one's constitutional rights in state court. For a single abortion, the law authorizes limitless suits in all 254 counties and provides that a victory in one has no preclusive effect in any other.

You make the point correctly that usually you can get pre-enforcement review in federal court when it's enforced, a law is enforced by a state prosecutor or a state executive official. That's longstanding law. The issue here is different because it's private enforcement in state courts, and that raises a novel issue for us about how to apply Ex parte Young. The Ex parte Young principle is that those who enforce the law can be enjoined or can be sued in pre-enforcement suits in federal court. But, as Justice Thomas points out, in the two paragraphs at the top of page 163 of Ex parte Young, state courts seem to be carved out from that. So that's the tension. I think you identified it. The principle of Ex parte Young versus the language at the top of 163, for me, that's been a real sticking point in trying to sort this out. Now one -- one answer you didn't give is that subsequent law says that when state courts entertain private civil suits, they enforce state law. And I wanted -- Shelley versus Kraemer being the most prominent landmark example of that.

12292,2021.21-463-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"Well, I -- I think all these arguments were the same arguments that Minnesota raised in Ex parte Young itself. I mean, you look at the history of that case, it was an extraordinary controversy in the United States and in Minnesota about the federal court review, and that itself didn't exist before Ex parte Young. In other words, that was an extension of preexisting doctrine to recognize a problem that the Chief Justice was identifying with deprivation of constitutional rights and chilling on the ability to get judicial review. So Ex parte Young sets out this principle that you can get pre-enforcement review in federal court against state enforcement of laws that are assertedly unconstitutional. And 999 times out of a thousand or maybe every time until this case, that's a state executive official. It's a pro forma exercise usually to identify the state executive official. And Justice Kagan points out there's a loophole that's been exploited here or used here, which is the private suits are enforced by state court clerks or judges. So the question becomes, should we extend the principle of Ex parte Young to, in essence, close that loophole? In other words, put aside the language in Ex parte Young for a second, and that is strong for you, I agree, but the principle of Ex parte Young and the whole sweep of Ex parte Young would suggest extending the principle here, arguably.","<speaker>Judd E.

I know that the argument is that he doesn't enforce this -- these laws, the attorney general here doesn't enforce these laws. But the district court suggested that wasn't true. It has some direct enforcement authority with regard to S.B. 8's fee-shifting provision concerning any legal challenge to any abortion restriction or regulation and may also have some constitutional authority under Texas law to enforce Texas law. The Ex parte Young fiction was that if there is an agent who can enforce the law in part or in whole and they're sued, then everyone else in the enforcement chain is enjoined. So, if every private citizen here has been deputized by the state to enforce this law for the bounty, then why wouldn't an injunction against the AG bar those citizens from going into court just the way it would bar attorney -- district attorneys or police officers from arresting people once that order has been issued or district attorneys from prosecuting those people for a violation of the law that a court has found unconstitutional and tell the attorney general, the representative of the state, is not legal?","<speaker>Judd E.

Now I take and I listen to what Ex parte Young said about not interfering with the work of the coordinate branches, ongoing work of the coordinate branches, but one thing that we said in Cooper versus Aaron was equally important, and that is ""constitutional rights declared by this Court can neither be nullified openly and directly by state legislatures or state executive or judicial officers -- and these are the key words -- ""nor indirectly through evasive schemes."" So, given what I just said, that that principle is inherent in the Constitution, why am I limited by Grupo Mexicano? Why would I be looking to a history that can't exist by its very nature? What does exist are the words we said in Ex parte Young, which was we are charged by Congress in ensuring that federal rights are respected directly or indirectly. So could you respond and tell me why we're limited by anything in terms of what an equitable remedy would be like, assuming we were to find -- and you can challenge the assumption, but you'll waste your time -- assuming we were to find that this was intend -- this scheme was intended to chill abortions that were constitutional?","<speaker>Judd E.

Number one, and this relates to Justice Alito's question, could she then use her discretion? Notwithstanding that the court had found grave risk, could it nonetheless say, yes, we're going to send the child back because there are sufficient ameliorative measures? So the first question is, could she make that order without abusing discretion? And I guess the second question is you -- you know the record better than I do, and you've read the various opinions more closely than I have. Do you think that the district court -- like, what do you think that the prospects are that the district court would want to do that? I mean, once the Second Circuit rule is taken away, do you think that there's really any chance that the district court would have said, yes, under my discretion, I think that these ameliorative measures are sufficient so as to send the child back?","<speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Second Circuit requires courts to consider the full range of ameliorative measures in every case involving a finding of grave risk under Article 13(b).

13068,2021.20-1034-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett,"So I think my sticking point is the same one that others have asked you. It's difficult to figure out how to write this paragraph. In your answer to Justice Kagan, I mean, I understand why the United States doesn't want to box itself in to a particular thing, but it, frankly, wouldn't give district courts that much guidance. And you were talking about not putting a thumb on the scale because at risk of falling into the error that the Second Circuit may have fallen into. But it did more than have a thumb on the scale. I mean, it had a categorical rule. And I don't see anything in the United States' position that would prevent -- Justice Alito talked about each court of appeals developing standards to guide the exercise of discretion. I don't see anything in what the United States has proposed that would prevent a thumb on the scale one way or another. You know, in -- in my discretion, I am generally going to use extreme caution, as I suggested to Ms. King, before imposing ameliorative measures in a domestic violence case. It seems to me like those are the kinds of things that shape discretion. And as Justice Kavanaugh said, it seems like, in these complex domestic violence-type cases, all of the risks that you're talking about would be present. So would it really be so bad if we tried to -- if we send it back, offer something in the way of guidance, even if it is simply to say, yes, district courts have discretion that should be exercised consistent with ICARA and the Hague Convention; however, given these concerns and how they are often present in domestic violence cases, use caution before going forward with them in that context?","<speaker>Frederick Liu</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Second Circuit requires courts to consider the full range of ameliorative measures in every case involving a finding of grave risk under Article 13(b).

It runs counter to the convention's purposes and framework, which emphasize expeditious proceedings, the safety of the child, and not getting entangled in custody matters. It's contrary to the long-standing views of the State Department. And no other signatory nation has adopted that interpretation of this treaty. If this Court agrees with us, what remains is how best to resolve this case. In our view, a reversal is warranted. It was three years ago today that the district court made its grave risk finding. Safe and swift resolution then would have allowed the child to remain in the U.S. in the interim while the custody proceedings deal with the complex family issues at this -- in this case, including the implications of Mr. Saada's sustained and horrific abuse. But the district court was forced by the Second Circuit to take a lengthy detour, which entangled itself in custody matters, forced the parties to obtain an Italian court order without investigating the effectiveness of that order. That process and the results are inconsistent with the convention, at once, far too long, far too entangled, and at the same time not robust and not protective enough. The child here is almost six years old. He has spent the vast majority of his life in legal limbo. Reversal provides the safe and swift closure he deserves.

The question here is which patients are entitled to Part A benefits. Section 426 states that every individual who satisfies certain requirements shall be eligible -- or shall -- shall be entitled to Part A benefits, and that provision and others make clear that the entitlement is not absolute but subject to conditions, and it is not negated merely because Medicare does not pay for particular units of care. That is the best reading of the statute's text, context, and its population-focused design, and, at a minimum, a reasonable reading that deserves deference. The court of appeals and Respondent's contrary reading rests on two inferences based on other language concerning other programs. The court of appeals inferred from Congress's references to ""persons eligible for Medicaid"" that in the Medicare fraction Congress must have meant ""entitled to Part A"" to mean something different than it means throughout the statute. But Congress's use of ""entitled"" and ""eligible"" is fully explained by its usage of those terms in the underlying Medicare and Medicaid programs governed by separate statutory frameworks. Congress simply took those terms as it found them. Respondent contends that the agency's approach to SSI benefits conflicts with its position here. That is not correct, as the agency explained in the 2010 regulation and as the Sixth Circuit explained in Metro Hospital.

So that's problem two. And then the phrase ""for such days,"" as I analyze this, becomes surplusage.

Dreeben</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves a fundamental question about the meaning of content-based regulation under the First Amendment. The Fifth Circuit interpreted this Court's decision in Reed to mean that any time that an officer must read a sign to apply the law, the law is content-based. That holding is wrong and should be reversed. A law is content-based on its face when the text of the law singles out specific subject matter for differential treatment. The law in Reed did that by distinguishing ideological, political, and directional signs. A rule regulating off-premises advertising does not. The off-premises rule is an empty vessel that applies to all subjects and topics. It turns on the relationship of a sign to its location, not the content of its message. The Fifth Circuit's rigid rule does not further First Amendment values. Austin's law does not skew the marketplace for speech or suppress any ideas. But the Fifth Circuit's rule would have untenable effects. Many ordinances can be applied only by looking at what a sign says. Temporary event signs are a perfect example. Strict scrutiny of such laws is unwarranted. Now Respondent offers a new theory, arguing that any sign code provision tied to the function or purpose of speech is content-based on its face. But many neutral laws are tied to function. Sign regulation is inherently functional. Signs function to present information. And the regulation of solicitation is based on the function of soliciting.

You have to read things to know anything about them. You have to read a sign to see if it's covered by the First Amendment, and you have to read it to know whether it's obscenity or not. Directional signs, as Justice Breyer said earlier, you have to read it to see if it's directional. And yet, I think it's illogical and contrary to any common sense to think that a regulation that says states can put up signs -- only states can put up directional signs on highways, that that's content-based. It -- just not logical. And so I think what Justice Breyer's trying to get at is that history teaches us -- it's just the history in this case; I joined Justice Alito's concurrence -- that there are certain types of functions, not purposes but functions, like on- and off-premises, that don't have a possibility or a direct effect on speech in the same way as a regulation that says only the religious -- as in Reed, that only religion can do X, politics can do Y, and this can do Z.

That holding is wrong and should be reversed. A law is content-based on its face when the text of the law singles out specific subject matter for differential treatment. The law in Reed did that by distinguishing ideological, political, and directional signs. A rule regulating off-premises advertising does not. The off-premises rule is an empty vessel that applies to all subjects and topics. It turns on the relationship of a sign to its location, not the content of its message. The Fifth Circuit's rigid rule does not further First Amendment values. Austin's law does not skew the marketplace for speech or suppress any ideas. But the Fifth Circuit's rule would have untenable effects. Many ordinances can be applied only by looking at what a sign says. Temporary event signs are a perfect example. Strict scrutiny of such laws is unwarranted. Now Respondent offers a new theory, arguing that any sign code provision tied to the function or purpose of speech is content-based on its face. But many neutral laws are tied to function. Sign regulation is inherently functional. Signs function to present information. And the regulation of solicitation is based on the function of soliciting. So long as these rules are even-handed, they are facially content-neutral. First Amendment review still applies, but the right standard is intermediate, not strict, scrutiny. Because the Fifth Circuit applied the wrong standard, its judgment should be reversed. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2021

Dreeben</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves a fundamental question about the meaning of content-based regulation under the First Amendment. The Fifth Circuit interpreted this Court's decision in Reed to mean that any time that an officer must read a sign to apply the law, the law is content-based. That holding is wrong and should be reversed. A law is content-based on its face when the text of the law singles out specific subject matter for differential treatment. The law in Reed did that by distinguishing ideological, political, and directional signs. A rule regulating off-premises advertising does not. The off-premises rule is an empty vessel that applies to all subjects and topics. It turns on the relationship of a sign to its location, not the content of its message. The Fifth Circuit's rigid rule does not further First Amendment values. Austin's law does not skew the marketplace for speech or suppress any ideas. But the Fifth Circuit's rule would have untenable effects. Many ordinances can be applied only by looking at what a sign says. Temporary event signs are a perfect example. Strict scrutiny of such laws is unwarranted. Now Respondent offers a new theory, arguing that any sign code provision tied to the function or purpose of speech is content-based on its face. But many neutral laws are tied to function. Sign regulation is inherently functional. Signs function to present information. And the regulation of solicitation is based on the function of soliciting. So long as these rules are even-handed, they are facially content-neutral. First Amendment review still applies, but the right standard is intermediate, not strict, scrutiny.

15669,2021.20-828-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch,"I -- I'd like to come at that same question from a different angle. Here's where I'm stuck, Mr. Kneedler. You know, Reynolds told us and General Dynamics reaffirmed that the state secret privilege allows the government to keep evidence away from a party but that generally the party is free to prove its case using other evidence. And so the government's really at a choice. Does it want to disclose the evidence and defend itself, or does it want to let a judgment, a tort judgment, go ahead against it and -- and keep -- keep national security safe? Okay. And FISA was enacted against that backdrop. And -- and if I were pressed, I would say FISA is perfectly consistent with that understanding of state secrets. The problem is that now the government takes a very -- much stronger view of what state secrets doctrine is and it imports a lot of the Totten stuff into it and says anytime we have a secret, we're -- we're entitled to use that evidence in our possession without telling you anything about it as a basis for dismissing the suit more or less as a matter of routine. And instead of being put to the choice of accepting a tort judgment but keeping a secret, it now gets both. It gets to reject the tort judgment and keep the secret. And in a -- in a world in which the national security state is growing larger every day, that's quite a power. And it seems like the Ninth Circuit operated on this understanding of the state secrets doctrine, which might be inconsistent with FISA, I think probably is inconsistent with FISA, and then we have to ask the question of which displaces. But that question only arises if we accept a mistaken view of the state secrets doctrine. And so I think your friends on the other side have made this point and suggested why don't we just address the state secrets problem and say the Ninth Circuit misunderstood state secrets doctrine and reverse or remand on that basis, and then we don't have to get into this question of a conflict which only arises on a mistaken understanding of state secrets doctrine.

McCloud</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The First Circuit held below that district courts are barred from considering intervening law and facts when deciding whether to impose a reduced sentence under the First Step Act. That holding conflicts with the law's text, and it flouts background principles of sentencing and judicial decision-making. The First Circuit's rule would also require courts to ignore information that is critical to the reasoned exercise of their sentencing discretion. Under the First Circuit's approach, the fact that a defendant was suspected in the murder of a prison guard would be an impermissible consideration when deciding whether to reduce that defendant's sentence. The government does not defend the First Circuit's rule. The judgment should therefore be vacated because the district court in this case plainly did not recognize its authority to consider intervening developments. The question for this Court is, what rule should apply on remand? The first option is that courts must consider relevant intervening law and facts, just as they do in other sentencing proceedings. This is a modest requirement. Under a ""must consider"" rule, the court has to pay respectful attention to arguments about intervening developments made by the parties.

Section 404 does not entitle a defendant to insist that the court consider other unrelated factual and legal developments since the original sentencing, including the more than 75 non-retroactive amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that the Commission has adopted since 2010.

Petitioner's principal argument, as you've heard this morning, in favor of such an entitlement rests on the term ""impose"" in Section 404, which Petitioner would read to incorporate a requirement to redo the Section 3553(a) analysis that a court does in imposing an initial sentence. That argument is inconsistent with the text of Section 404 as a whole, in particular, with the text of Section 404(c), as well as with the undisputedly limited scope and nature of sentence reduction proceedings. As the statutory text reflects, the lodestar of any proceeding under Section 404 is the defendant's existing lawful sentence.

By its plain terms, Section 404 only requires a district court to take account of one new development, namely, the changes to crack cocaine sentencing made by Sections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act. Section 404 does not entitle a defendant to insist that the court consider other unrelated factual and legal developments since the original sentencing, including the more than 75 non-retroactive amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that the Commission has adopted since 2010. Reading Section 404 to create such an entitlement would result in a significant and unjustified windfall for a select subset of crack cocaine offenders who were sentenced before the effective date of the Fair Sentencing Act. Petitioner's principal argument, as you've heard this morning, in favor of such an entitlement rests on the term ""impose"" in Section 404, which Petitioner would read to incorporate a requirement to redo the Section 3553(a) analysis that a court does in imposing an initial sentence. That argument is inconsistent with the text of Section 404 as a whole, in particular, with the text of Section 404(c), as well as with the undisputedly limited scope and nature of sentence reduction proceedings. As the statutory text reflects, the lodestar of any proceeding under Section 404 is the defendant's existing lawful sentence. At every single proceeding under Section 404, the district court has already fully considered the Section 3553(a) factors at the original sentencing, and the only question before the court is whether to reduce that current sentence.

That one, I think, gives you a stronger case than the ones that don't mention health and safety at all, or, for example, for ambulatory surgical centers, you know, the provision on which you rely describes the benefits provided to an individual, and then it lists the kind of services that would be covered, right, and then, parenthetically, it says ""performed at an ambulatory surgical center (that meets health and safety and other standards specified by the Secretary),"" it seems to me a heavier lift to say that that kind of aside in a parenthetical is a grant of authority to CMS to impose this kind of vaccination requirement on those who work at the ambulatory surgical centers. So I guess my question is this: One, you know, the government here is seeking the stay of the injunction and has the burden of showing likelihood of success on the merits, and -- and I understand because of space limits and the number of statutes on which you're now relying, it would be hard to make the specific case for each of these provisions, but what if I think some of the provisions might support you and others don't? This was an omnibus rule, and even though the Secretary, in a chart, identified all these, you know, specific provisions, we don't really have before us the structural and textual arguments directed at each of these provisions.

And -- and this regulation, arguably, the other side will say -- I'm sure we're going to hear it, so I didn't want you to not have a chance -- is going to say this effectively controls the employment of individuals at these healthcare facilities in a way that Congress specifically prohibited. As I understand your response, it is we're just providing money or not providing money, and by withholding money, we're not controlling who you hire. And I might understand that in some circumstances, but in a statute where everything is about spending, it's a Spending Clause statute, I would have thought that Congress would have understood and we should interpret this language in that light, that you cannot use the money as a weapon to control these things. And, in fact, of course, as you know, the Court has some anti-commandeering law. That's doctrinal speak for you can't always use money without -- and claim you're not controlling what's going on. And I wonder whether we should take particular cognizance of that here given that these statutes sometimes constitute, we're told, 10 percent of all the funding that state governments receive. This regulation affects, we're told, 10 million healthcare workers and will cost over a billion dollars for employers to comply with. So what's your reaction to that?

And -- and, you know, it just seems pretty basic to me, as I said, that the first thing that that means in the context of this pandemic is that providers can't be carriers of the disease itself. And then, in addition, there are other health benefits. You know, people are not showing up to hospitals because they're afraid of getting COVID from staff, and so they're not coming for their mammograms and they're not coming for their colonoscopies and so forth.

19218,2021.21A240-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Thank you, counsel. General Murrill, are you still on the line?","<speaker>Jesus A. Osete</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In early 2020, while millions stayed at home, millions of healthcare workers heroically stayed at their -- at work. These same workers are now forced to choose between losing their jobs and complying with the government's vaccine mandate. The Secretary claim -- the Secretary's claim of authority to impose this mandate is expansive, unprecedented, and unlawful for two principal reasons. First, the Secretary believes a series of vague catch-all provisions scattered throughout the Social Security Act authorize this sweeping mandate. But the relevant text, structure, and context say otherwise. For example, the Secretary ignores eight provisions that precede the catch-all prime -- provision he primarily invokes, all of which are materially unlike a permanent medical procedure that cannot be undone after a shift is over. Exceedingly clear language is required here because the mandate regulates matters that have traditionally been within the province of the states. Second, the rule is arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The Secretary impermissibly extrapolated evidence for one category of facilities to justify regulating all 15 and failed to adequately explain his sudden shift from encouraging vaccination to mandating it. But, more fundamentally, the Secretary overlooked the critical perspective of rural healthcare facilities in the states and the devastating consequences the mandate will have on rural Americans' access to healthcare. Categorically excluding an entire class from employment will mean that patients in rural Nebraska will have to seek primary and emergency care two to three hours away and cannot undergo surgery. This represents vast stretches of this country where healthcare is not provided by massive institutional providers with tens of thousands of employees but by smaller healthcare facilities run by local communities. While a 1 percent loss of staff may be insignificant to the former, it is fatal to the latter. Without the injunction, rural America will face an imminent crisis.

I think that's going to be an important matter, and I'd like you to address it.","<speaker>Brian H. Fletcher</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Hospitals, nursing homes, and other Medicare and Medicaid providers serve patients who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 in settings that are especially conducive to the spread of the virus. The Secretary required those providers to make sure that their staff are vaccinated, subject to medical and religious exemptions, because he found that vaccination is the best way to prevent workers from infecting their patients with a potentially deadly disease. He also found that any delay in implementing that requirement would cause preventable deaths and severe illnesses. The preliminary injunctions in these cases are delaying that urgently needed protection for Medicaid and Medicare patients in half the country. This Court should stay those injunctions for two reasons. First, requiring medical staff vaccination during a pandemic falls squarely within the Secretary's statutory authority to protect the health and safety of Medicare and Medicaid patients. Vaccination requirements are a traditional and common way to curb the spread of infectious disease. Many healthcare workers are already required to be vaccinated against diseases like hepatitis, measles, and the flu. And the medical community overwhelmingly supports COVID-19 vaccination requirements, which have been adopted by providers around the country. Those requirements are, in short, the paradigmatic example of a health and safety measure. Second, the Secretary's decision was thoroughly explained and supported by the record. The states do not seriously deny that requiring vaccination will save lives. Instead, they predict that it will cause staffing shortages, especially in some rural areas. But the Secretary carefully considered that concern. He explained that experience from around the country shows that most workers actually will choose to be vaccinated rather than to leave their jobs in response to vaccination requirements. And he concluded that the risk of some temporary staffing shortages is outweighed by the urgent need to protect all Medicare and Medicaid patients during a deadly pandemic.

Patterson</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress has set out a default rule to preserve the validity of copyright registrations even if they contain some inaccurate information. Under Section 411(b), such a registration remains adequate to support an infringement action unless the registrant has included inaccurate information in its application to the Copyright Office with knowledge that it was inaccurate. Now, with respect to that key knowledge condition, the Ninth Circuit has set out an unprecedented rule that could jeopardize many thousands of copyright registrations under conditions never before thought to give rise to a risk of invalidation, and that's because the Ninth Circuit has decided that a registrant's knowledge of an inaccuracy is decided by looking solely at that registrant's factual knowledge, even if the inaccuracy at issue arises solely because of a law. And that was error. We think that in order to risk invalidation of your registration, a registrant needs to actually be aware that it's submitting an inaccuracy and that that is just as true of legal inaccuracies as it is of factual ones. I welcome the Court's question, or I'd like to turn first to the Ninth Circuit's rule as actually applied in this case. I think there is some suggestion by Respondent of an alternate rule, a constructive knowledge standard rule, and, in fact, that appears to be the sort of front-line defense of what the Ninth Circuit did here. That standard appears nowhere in the Ninth Circuit's decision. The Ninth Circuit did not say: Well, we think Unicolors should have known the correct requirements to submit a single unit of publication and flouted them, and, therefore, we are going to hold them to their error. The Ninth Circuit said that it was irrelevant whether they knew what the requirements to submit that type of application were, whether it knew of the bundling requirement that the Ninth Circuit decided exists under the regulation. So, even if this Court decides that some form of constructive knowledge is necessary, that would require a remand.</text>",2021

The answer is that it requires subjective awareness of what -- of the inaccuracy itself. The same standard applies whether the inaccuracy was because the applicant misunderstood the law or misunderstood the facts or included a typo. Simply put, you don't have information -- you don't -- excuse me -- you don't know that information is inaccurate if you honestly believe it to be accurate. The safe harbor of Section 411(b) does not suggest an exception when that belief exists because you did not predict where the law would go or you did not know how the law applies to the facts. This Court can get to that result through two separate routes. The first is the plain text, and the second is a presumption. No court in a century had invalidated a copyright registration based upon an innocent legal error. And Congress is presumed not to have radically changed that rule by hiding that change in the word ""knowledge."" Like the courts, Congress considered it more important to give authors and artists an effective remedy against IP thieves than it was to demand perfect compliance with complex legal requirements in a form. The Ninth Circuit's rule will wreak havoc. Every time a court decides an unsettled question of law, it would cast doubt on the validity of countless registrations. Now there are three specific points to make about the text here. The first is that Section 411(b) starts with a default rule that a registration is valid ""regardless of any"" -- ""any inaccurate information."" So that means without regard to whether that information is a fact or a legal conclusion. Second, Section 411(b) is pretty unique among the statutes that this Court has encountered in the past in that it's not requiring knowledge of several elements and all you have to do is figure out which one needs to be knowing, but, here, it requires knowledge of very -- something very specific. It inquires knowledge that the information reflected in the application is wrong, not knowledge of what happens to be right or wrong in the world outside the application, not knowledge of things that might help you figure out that the application is wrong, not the ability with reasonable diligence to figure out whether the application is wrong, but knowledge that there is wrong information on the application.

For the drugs covered by the statute, paragraph (14) directs that the agency may set rates based on acquisition cost and vary rates by hospital groups if it conducts a cost study that meets the requirements of the paragraph. If it does not do a cost study, rates must equal the average price for the drug determined by a cross-referenced statutory formula calculated and adjusted as necessary for purposes of the paragraph. Now, in the order at issue, HHS set rates for Section 340B hospitals different from the rates for all other hospitals and purported to base those rates on acquisition costs, but it did not conduct the cost study that the statute requires. Now, at the threshold, the government asserts that courts cannot review that agency action. But no statutory text precludes review, and it makes sense that Congress would want review because the point of paragraph (14) was to constrain agency discretion. On the merits, the government asserts that separate cost-based rates for 340B hospitals can be justified as an exercise of the agency's authority to adjust price-based rates that the statute requires in the absence of a cost study. But paragraph (14) does not authorize HHS to vary price-based rates by hospital group, and it authorizes varying cost-based rates only in the presence of a cost study. And beyond that, HHS didn't base the rates it set for 340B hospitals on average price at all. It estimated the acquisition cost using a different formula and then swapped that number in for the average price number. That's a substitution. It's not an adjustment. And it can't be justified under Chevron.

19904,2021.20-1114-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"-- correct? And I think you have a stronger argument to say, if Congress says you can't include the 340B costs, then you can't add it back in and adjust it later when they restricted you from using it once already. I have a more difficult time buying your argument that a word as broad as ""adjust"" for purposes of this paragraph would limit the agency altogether from deciding that there were regional differences that had to be compensated. So, for example, if there were higher wages in one part of the country as opposed to another, I don't see why the agency couldn't and wouldn't say for the Northeast, we think the ASOP should be 8 percent as opposed to 6 percent because wages are comparable to overhead costs and we should vary the ASOP on that basis. And so I -- I have problems with your argument that, in all situations, we should say the agency can't define regional differences or can't define hospital groups. I find it a stronger argument to say they can't do it on 340B because acquisition cost says you can't base it on that.","<speaker>Donald B.

You know, your friend on the other side has said that we should, you know, apply a Kisor versus Wilkie approach here, emphasize that lower courts in applying Chevron need to apply all of the tools in the toolkit. And a lot of the questions that you've been getting that we've been going back and forth about have to do with the problem that there's superfluity maybe on either side of this. So -- and I -- I would have thought that the theory of Chevron is that when there's ambiguity in a statute, maybe vagueness would be the better description, that that's an indication that Congress has delegated authority to the agency to fill it. But the D.C. Circuit described it this way.

21045,2021.21-328-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Ms. -- Ms. Gilbride, what if the standards for waiver under state law are different with respect to arbitration and other provisions in the contract? Then that would violate the Federal Arbitration Act, right?","<speaker>Karla A. Gilbride</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act requires that an agreement to arbitrate be enforced unless a generally applicable contract defense renders it unenforceable. But the Eighth Circuit didn't apply a generally applicable contract defense here. It applied an arbitration-specific waiver defense that requires the person asserting waiver to prove prejudice, even though prejudice isn't required to establish waiver of other contractual rights in Iowa. That's what the Eighth Circuit did wrong, and that's why we're here. But there's been a lot of discussion in the briefs about Section 3 and default, so I wanted to quickly explain what the Eighth Circuit should have done instead. First, it should have assessed Robyn Morgan's waiver defense under generally applicable Iowa law to determine if there was an enforceable contract on which the procedural provisions of the FAA could operate. If it found waiver under state law, that would have been the end of the inquiry. If it found no waiver, meaning that there was still a live contract for Sundance to enforce, then, because Sundance sought a stay under Section 3, the Court would still have had to assess if Sundance's actions were in default in proceeding with the arbitration. So whether Sundance's actions constituted default is a secondary question, not a replacement for the first-order waiver inquiry. And even if we get to default here, nothing in that term connotes prejudice either, for default, like waiver, is a unilateral concept that focuses on the defaulting party's failure to perform an obligation.

If we are going to send the courts of appeals, district courts off looking at state law on this issue, are they going to find that state law generally has arbitration-specific rules about waiver, or are they going to find that state law generally treats the waiver of arbitration exactly the same as the waiver of other contract defenses? So let me give you three situations and ask you to tell me whether they involve an arbitration-specific rule. The first one involves a state that has a rule that says a procedure -- a rule of procedure that says that arbitration has to be asserted in the answer, but it does not provide that with respect to any other contract defense. Then the second situation is similar to the first, but the rule also includes some but not all other contract defenses. And the third involves a situation where there isn't a state rule on this issue at all, but if you look at state case law, the state case law makes the waiver of arbitration a lot easier than the waiver of other contract defenses.

21084,2021.21-328-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Clement, the problem I have with your answer for Justice Breyer is that the essence of the agreement here is to not be in litigation. Now you can argue the Petitioner, by filing a claim in court, she herself has waived it. So the fact that I waive it just evens out. I understand that argument. But the question becomes, did you know that you had the right to arbitration? And, here, you knew. Nevertheless, you didn't move for arbitration in the answer as a defense. You made a motion to transfer the case. When that motion was denied, you indicated a willingness to continue in litigation and went into settlement talks, and, actually, there were materials produced. By its nature, there was a delay in the speedy adjudication of the case because you didn't move to begin with to go to arbitration, so that's delay, something that was bought -- negotiated for. And the cost is the cost that Justice Kavanaugh said, an unnecessary motion, an unnecessary type of settlement agreement. Arbitration settlement agreements rarely require the production of materials. They just require talking. So having said all of that to you, the reason you waited was because you wanted to see how the court -- by your own admission, you wanted to wait to see if the court was going to approve of class actions in arbitration. So you were taking a calculated risk by staying in litigation. Why isn't that a waiver under Section 6? Why isn't that a waiver under any normal definition? It prejudiced the other side.

My client, Sundance, moved for a motion under Section 3, and it is not in violation of any contractual deadline, any court rule, or any other legal obligation. The parties here agreed to arbitrate instead of going to court. That agreement did not put a deadline on a party asserting a right to arbitrate if the other side broke the promise, and it incorporated rules that warn against a finding of waiver because of litigation conduct. In this circumstance, simply not filing a motion as expeditiously as possible, without violating a court rule or imposing prejudice on the other side, does not result in a default. And, under those circumstances, Section 3 directs courts shall grant the motion. Under state law, the same result would follow. All state law doctrines require prejudice in these circumstances. Courts are use -- loose in the way that they go about using the term ""waiver,"" but the kind of strict, no-prejudice form of waiver on which Petitioner's whole argument depends is limited to true waiver, the intentional relinquishment of a known right. That's not what is at issue here. And what is at issue is simply not asserting a right soon enough. That is the office of estoppel and laches, which require prejudice. And even in the case of a true waiver, you can retract in the absence of prejudice. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2021

22016,2021.20-1775-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas,"Mr. Fletcher, I think Petitioner was doing a little bit more than simply disagreeing with the acquiescence. From my understanding, they were disagreeing with the government's refusal to allow them to participate or to intervene at the appellate level in very -- in litigation that they thought would affect them significantly. So how do you -- rather than simply focusing on the underlying issue, would you also respond to the fact that they think that intervention is a normal practice in these -- some of these cases at the end of administrations? I don't recall the government opposing such interventions, so would you simply address that a little bit?","<speaker>Brian H. Fletcher</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The 2019 Public Charge Rule did not regulate or confer any rights on the Petitioner states. Instead, Petitioners assert an indirect economic interest in the rule's downstream consequences. Relying on predictions that were made when the rule was drafted, they say that it would cause DHS to deny adjustment of status to people who would be more likely to use state-funded public benefits at some point in the future. But we now know that those predictions were wrong. During the year that the 2019 rule was in effect, we know that it affected only about five of the approximately 50,000 adjustment of status applications to which it was applied or about 1-100th of 1 percent. The states do not have a legally protectable interest in preserving that negligible indirect effect, and, even if it did, they could not justify intervention in appeals from preliminary injunctions that do not apply in Petitioners' jurisdictions and that now have no effect anywhere because the 2019 rule has been vacated in a separate final judgment. The court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in declining to allow Petitioners to prolong appeals that no longer have any practical consequence. And Petitioners' criticisms of the government's litigation conduct do not call for a different result. Congress made a policy choice to vest in the Department of Justice the decision whether to seek further review of decisions against the United States. This Court has emphasized that both the government and the courts benefit from that policy precisely because the solicitor general takes a selective approach and often decides against seeking further review, and as some of the questions this morning have suggested, it's not at all uncommon for the solicitor general to make that decision when the decision in question invalidated a regulation. Here, DHS had decided to issue a new Public Charge Rule. The ongoing litigation would have complicated that rulemaking and required intrusive discovery. The 2019 rule was not producing its intended effects, and the rule's unintended and unwanted effects were aggravated in the public health crisis.
