530,2021.20-1472-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas,"Ms. Sherry, why would Congress permit the Tax Court to take into -- to consider an untimely action but then not allow it to enjoin a levy action?","<speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has repeatedly held that time limits are rarely jurisdictional and that if Congress wants to make them jurisdictional, it has to speak clearly. Section 6330(d)(1) does not have the needed clarity. The first clause reads like an ordinary statute of limitations. It says what the taxpayer may do, and it says nothing about the Tax Court's jurisdiction. The second clause does speak to jurisdiction, but the only reference back to the first is through the two words ""such matter."" Now we think ""such matter"" refers to a petition to the Tax Court for review of a CDP determination. The Commissioner agrees, but he says it also refers to the 30-day deadline to file that petition. Our reading is more natural. It stops at the closest reasonable antecedent, and it uses the word ""matter"" as it's ordinarily understood. The Commissioner's reading requires more work, and it requires this Court to treat the time limit the same as subject matter in the context of subject matter jurisdiction. If nothing else, it is far from clear. The statutory history resolves any doubt. As originally enacted, the same time limit governed the Tax Court and the district courts and it was not jurisdictional. The relevant language has not changed. It has to mean the same thing today as it did in 1998. Congress enacted this collection due process regime in order to protect taxpayers from IRS abuses. It would not have included a rare and harsh jurisdictional deadline to close those courthouse doors, let alone through a vague parenthetical reference to ""such matter."" And equitable tolling easily follows from that. That is the presumption, and it is not overcome here. The limitations period looks just like the one in Irwin, and it looks nothing like the deadlines in Brockamp. The CDP regime is remedial, and it is a place where equity finds a comfortable home.

531,2021.20-1472-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"-- the Chief just said that ""matter"" referred to determination in his question, because that's logical, isn't it? ""Matter"" suggests a noun, and the closest antecedent noun is ""determination."" Yet -- and, in fact, if you read Section 6330(d)(3), it provides that the IRS appeals office shall retain jurisdiction with respect to any determination made under this section. So the statute by its own terms in another provision is making clear that jurisdiction is tied to determination, not petition. The 30-day period, the 30-day limitation, is tied to the petition, not to the determination, correct?","<speaker>Melissa Arbus Sherry</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has repeatedly held that time limits are rarely jurisdictional and that if Congress wants to make them jurisdictional, it has to speak clearly.

As originally enacted, the same time limit governed the Tax Court and the district courts and it was not jurisdictional. The relevant language has not changed. It has to mean the same thing today as it did in 1998. Congress enacted this collection due process regime in order to protect taxpayers from IRS abuses. It would not have included a rare and harsh jurisdictional deadline to close those courthouse doors, let alone through a vague parenthetical reference to ""such matter."" And equitable tolling easily follows from that. That is the presumption, and it is not overcome here. The limitations period looks just like the one in Irwin, and it looks nothing like the deadlines in Brockamp. The CDP regime is remedial, and it is a place where equity finds a comfortable home.

Bond</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 6330(d)(1) contains what most statutory deadlines lack: text that expressly addresses the Court's jurisdiction and ties it to the time limit for seeking review. The second clause states the -- the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter. Petitioner agrees that ""such matter"" refers to the petition described in the first clause, which permits a person within 30 days to petition for review of a collection due process determination. And it is common ground that the Tax Court's jurisdiction is contingent on the filing of a petition described in the first clause. The narrow dispute is whether ""such matter"" refers to a petition that meets both of the first clause's requirements or selectively incorporates just one. The clear meaning of the text in context is that ""such matter"" refers to a petition that satisfies both. The first clause describes a single act, filing a petition that meets two criteria. And the time limit is embedded in the verb phrase. That is confirmed by paragraph (e)(1) at page 14a of our appendix, which undisputedly makes the Tax Court's jurisdiction to grant an injunction contingent on a timely petition. Petitioner cannot explain why Congress would make a timely petition a jurisdictional prerequisite to that remedy but not to the Court's authority to decide the case. The interlocking statutory structure and nearly a century of decisions addressing analogous Tax Court provisions reinforce that understanding. Petitioner's argument at bottom is that various non-jurisdictional readings can be posited. But none of them clouds the clear statement that Congress provided because none is ultimately tenable after all the interpretive tools are applied. But, at a minimum, the deadline is mandatory, not subject to ad hoc exceptions.

I'd like to make two additional points this morning. First, the war powers, including the Army and Navy clauses, are unique and fundamentally different from the Constitution's other grants of power, unique textually, unique structurally, and unique historically. The states could not have read the Constitution seeing the federal structure it created and believed they would retain sovereign authority to interfere with the federal government's preeminent national defense function. Second, USERRA's protections are crucial in light of the structure of the modern military. At the turn of the 20th Century, it became apparent the United States would be -- would be required to wage war on a global scale and at a moment's notice and that this would require an immense fighting force. Rather than create a massive peacetime standing army, the United States instead created a reserve component, trained soldiers who would keep their civilian jobs but would be ready to respond at a moment's notice to unpredictable global threats. To convince soldiers to join that force and to ensure that soldiers in it would be willing to risk significant injury without hesitation, Congress promised these soldiers that they would not be discriminated against on the basis of their military service or service-connected injuries.

I understand the textual commitments in the Fourteenth Amendment, but, here, we're being asked to adopt a view of implicit penumbras emanating from the War Powers Act -- sorry, from the war powers that the president and the Congress have in Article I and Article II. And you're giving us a very broad view of what those powers are, including to raise Armies, going so far as to suits against the states for veterans coming home, and without any linkage to necessity of any current exigency or any need for troops today. There's no argument here, as I understand it, that this is actually necessary or that Congress couldn't and the federal government couldn't bring these suits themselves if they wanted to do so. There's no argument that this is necessary -- allowing private suits against states is necessary to raise an Army in the United States today. And so I guess I'm just wondering, what are the limits? I mean, Justice -- Justice Alito posited a pretty interesting example about potholes on interstate highways. Would every state policy that could be subject to an argument that it would impair the ability of the federal government to raise an Army or a Navy or to conduct war be subject to suit, private suit, by private individuals with punitive damages and attorneys' fees? Is -- the broader you argue for the war powers of the United States, the broader the consequences are for federalism, and -- and I just want you to have a chance to address that.","<speaker>Christopher G.

One of the problems in PennEast was that New Jersey, by refusing -- by -- by -- by refusing to cooperate in the policy decision that the United States had made with respect to national gas pipelines, was thwarting federal policy. And isn't it all the more serious here to have the states have the potential to thwart -- I mean, let's -- let's imagine that states decide -- let's say we get involved in Ukraine and states say that we shouldn't be, and so they use discrimination against veterans returning home to express their disapproval of our engagement.","<speaker>Andrew T.

956,2021.20-603-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, I -- I can't take much from the lack of cases or evidence of Congress doing something until a need arises because I can't see Congress prophylactically passing rules if it doesn't see they're necessary until they become necessary. And, really, the Vietnam War is what made this statute necessary because it's the first time we see a state potentially taking action that's going to directly affect the military's power. But do you discount the 1830s history, where, as did Justice Gorsuch, with respect to the habeas power? And, there, courts were releasing federal military officers from state custody because they were needed for the war efforts at the time, and the courts and the states had absolutely no hesitation in saying that Congressional need superseded the states' need to -- to hold a prisoner in custody. That was an individual suit, not for money, I grant you, but you didn't need money there because all you needed was the person to be released. So I guess what I'm asking is you concede that the states knew that if they impeded the war effort they would be sued by the federal government at least. I know that the first opportunity an individual had to sue in the 1830s for his own release, the courts gave him that power, the individual, to sue the state in state court. So what is the next step missing with respect to the Plan of the Convention that we need some further proof that there was a belief that there wasn't a power to sue the states for individual damages?

When a proposed intervenor's interest is identical to one that's already represented in the case, we presume that the existing representative is adequate, and that common-sense presumption holds particular force when the existing representative is a state official charged ethically and legally with defending state interests. The presumption is further supported by the strong federal interest in requiring states to speak with a single voice at a time in federal litigation. From the vantage point of federal law, there's one state. The state as a unified entity is what matters for federalism purposes, and it's the state that has the sovereign interest in defending state law. Where one state representative decides to no longer represent that interest, like in the Cameron situation, then a properly appointed state representative can come in to vindicate the interest that's no longer being represented. That's the same way federal law requires the United States to notify Congress to enable intervention when it stops defending a statute. But where an authorized state representative is actively defending the law, Rule 24's goals of ensuring coherent presentation and simplified litigation should prevail. And this case is the poster child for why federal law puts a thumb on the scale against intervention when a state agent is already there defending. Unlike in Cameron, there's just no need for intervention here. Petitioners explicitly seek to assert the state's sovereign interest in enforceability and defense of state law, the exact interest the Attorney General is charged by statute with representing and is telling this Court he is representing. And he's not only representing that interest, but unfortunately for my clients, he's winning. And then, on the other side of the ledger, allowing the state to speak with multiple voices at once would complicate litigation and draw federal courts into state law disputes, such as the substantial ones here about what state statutes in the state constitution mean.

The government attempts to say that Babcock's service was not as wholly a member of the uniformed service.

Indeed, 32 U.S.C. 709 requires technicians like him to literally ""wear the uniform of the armed services, be a member of the National Guard, and hold the military grade specified by the Secretary."" And Babcock did. He wore the U.S. Army uniform day in, day out, teaching people how to fly Black Hawk helicopters and the like. Babcock engaged in service. He was a dual-status tech. He's undoubtedly a member of a uniformed service. Indeed, the Section 410(m) expressly says National Guard folks qualify. The government says Babcock was a civilian. Even if this were true, it would be irrelevant. The key statute, 415, doesn't use a civil-versus-military dividing line. It simply asks was the service uniformed. The government attempts to say that Babcock's service was not as wholly a member of the uniformed service. But the best reading of the statute, even before one gets to the veterans canon, rejects that. There is no status language in 415. The government would convert the word ""as"" into a status test trying to discern what hat someone was wearing at a given point in time. Congress certainly could have made such a choice, and, indeed, it has in many other statutes, but it did nothing like that here. So we have three basic arguments. One, the statute doesn't look to civilian status. It looks to uniformed service. Second, even if civilian status mattered, this would meet it. Dual-status tech service is irreducibly military.

And Babcock did. He wore the U.S. Army uniform day in, day out, teaching people how to fly Black Hawk helicopters and the like. Babcock engaged in service. He was a dual-status tech. He's undoubtedly a member of a uniformed service. Indeed, the Section 410(m) expressly says National Guard folks qualify. The government says Babcock was a civilian. Even if this were true, it would be irrelevant. The key statute, 415, doesn't use a civil-versus-military dividing line. It simply asks was the service uniformed. The government attempts to say that Babcock's service was not as wholly a member of the uniformed service. But the best reading of the statute, even before one gets to the veterans canon, rejects that. There is no status language in 415. The government would convert the word ""as"" into a status test trying to discern what hat someone was wearing at a given point in time. Congress certainly could have made such a choice, and, indeed, it has in many other statutes, but it did nothing like that here. So we have three basic arguments. One, the statute doesn't look to civilian status. It looks to uniformed service. Second, even if civilian status mattered, this would meet it. Dual-status tech service is irreducibly military. And, third, if there's any ambiguity, the veterans canon would suggest reading it in favor of Mr. Babcock.</text>",2021

1626,2021.20-480-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch,"Counsel, as -- as I understand your -- your colleague on the other side, and I may not, but, as I understand it as best I can in this area, we -- we all understand that National Guardsmen serve in at least two capacities, and one of them is denominated by the government for purposes of its own HR administration as civilian. And -- and so, fine, he served as a civilian when he was working as a technician. That was -- that's how you classified it. But just looking at the language of the statute -- and I think this is the argument in its simplest terms as I understand it -- was -- were the payments based -- were they made wholly on service in the capacity of -- as -- as a member of the uniformed service, and the answer he would give is yes because, while you denominate it civilian for certain purposes, you also said it could only be performed by someone who is a member of a uniformed service. So the work may be civilian for a bunch of other purposes, but it can only be performed by someone who is serving in the capacity of a National Guardsman. What's wrong with that argument?","<speaker>Nicole F. Reaves</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a dual-status technician retires, he receives two separate streams of payments, and the application of the uniformed services exception depends on the basis for each set of payments that he receives. First, he receives Civil Service Retirement System payments from the Office of Personnel Management for the work that he performs in his full-time civilian role as a technician. Those payments do not trigger the uniformed services exception because they are based on his civilian employment. A technician also receives a second stream of payments which are military retirement payments from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for his part-time military service, that is, his inactive duty training and drills and his active duty service in the National Guard. Those military retirement payments do trigger the uniformed service exception because they are based wholly on service in a qualifying National Guard capacity. And Petitioner and other dual-status technicians like him, when they were in the role, received two separate paychecks with two separate leave and earnings statements. One was a paycheck for their 9-to-5 technician work, and the other was the paycheck for all their inactive and active duty service. Congress also repeatedly categorized technician service as outside -- as civilian service, not uniformed service. First, Congress did not include dual-status technicians within the definition of a member of a uniformed service that is cross-referenced in the uniformed services exception. Second, in Section 10216 of Title 10, one of the two primary provisions that governs dual-status technicians, Congress describes technicians as civilian four separate times. And, third, in Title 5, Congress defined technician employment as falling within the civilian service of the government and ensured that technicians would receive civilian retirement payments for their civilian employment. I think I'd start then by discussing a couple of points that my friend on the other side made, and the first is whether an individual knows what type of status they're in at any given point in time. And it's actually quite clear what status a technician is at any point. During his 9-to-5 job, a technician is doing work in the technician role, and in that role, he has a variety of benefits that he doesn't have while he's working in his National Guard role, and that includes the fact that he can join a union. He can file complaints with the EEOC and MSPB. He can receive compensatory time off and worker's compensation. And he's compensated under the federal GS system. That's different from his National Guard service which he performs on weekends or if he's called up to active duty. Now my friend on the other side has suggested that if you are -- were to accept the government's position in this case, inactive duty service, such as training and drills, wouldn't trigger the uniformed services exception. And that's wrong because of a specific provision that deems such service as federal for the purpose of federal funding. And that provision is 10 U.S.C. 12602(a), which provides that for the purposes of laws providing benefits for members of the Army National Guard of the United States, military training, duty, or other service performed by a member of the Army National Guard of the United States in his status as a member of the Army National Guard, for which he's entitled to pay from the United States, shall be considered military training, duty, or other service in the federal service. So let me unpack that a little bit. What that means is that when an individual is in his state status, which usually happens when he's doing inactive training and drills, because of this provision, he's paid by the federal government as a general matter, and that does, in fact, trigger the uniformed services exception because that payment is payment for qualifying service.

A technician also receives a second stream of payments which are military retirement payments from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for his part-time military service, that is, his inactive duty training and drills and his active duty service in the National Guard. Those military retirement payments do trigger the uniformed service exception because they are based wholly on service in a qualifying National Guard capacity. And Petitioner and other dual-status technicians like him, when they were in the role, received two separate paychecks with two separate leave and earnings statements. One was a paycheck for their 9-to-5 technician work, and the other was the paycheck for all their inactive and active duty service. Congress also repeatedly categorized technician service as outside -- as civilian service, not uniformed service. First, Congress did not include dual-status technicians within the definition of a member of a uniformed service that is cross-referenced in the uniformed services exception. Second, in Section 10216 of Title 10, one of the two primary provisions that governs dual-status technicians, Congress describes technicians as civilian four separate times. And, third, in Title 5, Congress defined technician employment as falling within the civilian service of the government and ensured that technicians would receive civilian retirement payments for their civilian employment. I think I'd start then by discussing a couple of points that my friend on the other side made, and the first is whether an individual knows what type of status they're in at any given point in time. And it's actually quite clear what status a technician is at any point. During his 9-to-5 job, a technician is doing work in the technician role, and in that role, he has a variety of benefits that he doesn't have while he's working in his National Guard role, and that includes the fact that he can join a union. He can file complaints with the EEOC and MSPB. He can receive compensatory time off and worker's compensation. And he's compensated under the federal GS system. That's different from his National Guard service which he performs on weekends or if he's called up to active duty. Now my friend on the other side has suggested that if you are -- were to accept the government's position in this case, inactive duty service, such as training and drills, wouldn't trigger the uniformed services exception. And that's wrong because of a specific provision that deems such service as federal for the purpose of federal funding. And that provision is 10 U.S.C. 12602(a), which provides that for the purposes of laws providing benefits for members of the Army National Guard of the United States, military training, duty, or other service performed by a member of the Army National Guard of the United States in his status as a member of the Army National Guard, for which he's entitled to pay from the United States, shall be considered military training, duty, or other service in the federal service. So let me unpack that a little bit. What that means is that when an individual is in his state status, which usually happens when he's doing inactive training and drills, because of this provision, he's paid by the federal government as a general matter, and that does, in fact, trigger the uniformed services exception because that payment is payment for qualifying service.

And that provision is 10 U.S.C. 12602(a), which provides that for the purposes of laws providing benefits for members of the Army National Guard of the United States, military training, duty, or other service performed by a member of the Army National Guard of the United States in his status as a member of the Army National Guard, for which he's entitled to pay from the United States, shall be considered military training, duty, or other service in the federal service. So let me unpack that a little bit. What that means is that when an individual is in his state status, which usually happens when he's doing inactive training and drills, because of this provision, he's paid by the federal government as a general matter, and that does, in fact, trigger the uniformed services exception because that payment is payment for qualifying service. Now dual-status technician service is different because Congress has categorized that service as outside the uniformed service and the payments for that service as civilian in nature.</text>",2021
1642,2021.20-480-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Justice Barrett? Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Mr. Katyal?","<speaker>Nicole F. Reaves</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a dual-status technician retires, he receives two separate streams of payments, and the application of the uniformed services exception depends on the basis for each set of payments that he receives. First, he receives Civil Service Retirement System payments from the Office of Personnel Management for the work that he performs in his full-time civilian role as a technician. Those payments do not trigger the uniformed services exception because they are based on his civilian employment. A technician also receives a second stream of payments which are military retirement payments from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for his part-time military service, that is, his inactive duty training and drills and his active duty service in the National Guard. Those military retirement payments do trigger the uniformed service exception because they are based wholly on service in a qualifying National Guard capacity. And Petitioner and other dual-status technicians like him, when they were in the role, received two separate paychecks with two separate leave and earnings statements. One was a paycheck for their 9-to-5 technician work, and the other was the paycheck for all their inactive and active duty service. Congress also repeatedly categorized technician service as outside -- as civilian service, not uniformed service. First, Congress did not include dual-status technicians within the definition of a member of a uniformed service that is cross-referenced in the uniformed services exception. Second, in Section 10216 of Title 10, one of the two primary provisions that governs dual-status technicians, Congress describes technicians as civilian four separate times. And, third, in Title 5, Congress defined technician employment as falling within the civilian service of the government and ensured that technicians would receive civilian retirement payments for their civilian employment. I think I'd start then by discussing a couple of points that my friend on the other side made, and the first is whether an individual knows what type of status they're in at any given point in time. And it's actually quite clear what status a technician is at any point. During his 9-to-5 job, a technician is doing work in the technician role, and in that role, he has a variety of benefits that he doesn't have while he's working in his National Guard role, and that includes the fact that he can join a union. He can file complaints with the EEOC and MSPB. He can receive compensatory time off and worker's compensation. And he's compensated under the federal GS system. That's different from his National Guard service which he performs on weekends or if he's called up to active duty. Now my friend on the other side has suggested that if you are -- were to accept the government's position in this case, inactive duty service, such as training and drills, wouldn't trigger the uniformed services exception. And that's wrong because of a specific provision that deems such service as federal for the purpose of federal funding. And that provision is 10 U.S.C. 12602(a), which provides that for the purposes of laws providing benefits for members of the Army National Guard of the United States, military training, duty, or other service performed by a member of the Army National Guard of the United States in his status as a member of the Army National Guard, for which he's entitled to pay from the United States, shall be considered military training, duty, or other service in the federal service.

David Babcock, who served as a dual-status technician in the National Guard for 33 years, qualifies. Indeed, 32 U.S.C. 709 requires technicians like him to literally ""wear the uniform of the armed services, be a member of the National Guard, and hold the military grade specified by the Secretary.""

He's undoubtedly a member of a uniformed service. Indeed, the Section 410(m) expressly says National Guard folks qualify. The government says Babcock was a civilian. Even if this were true, it would be irrelevant. The key statute, 415, doesn't use a civil-versus-military dividing line. It simply asks was the service uniformed. The government attempts to say that Babcock's service was not as wholly a member of the uniformed service. But the best reading of the statute, even before one gets to the veterans canon, rejects that. There is no status language in 415. The government would convert the word ""as"" into a status test trying to discern what hat someone was wearing at a given point in time. Congress certainly could have made such a choice, and, indeed, it has in many other statutes, but it did nothing like that here. So we have three basic arguments. One, the statute doesn't look to civilian status. It looks to uniformed service. Second, even if civilian status mattered, this would meet it. Dual-status tech service is irreducibly military.

Instead, it excluded the employment contracts of seamen, railroad employees, and any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce. This Court made clear in New Prime that we interpret this exemption just as we would any other statute, by the meaning of its words at the time it was passed. Those words exempt airline employees who load and unload cargo. Southwest can't dispute that by 1925 it was blackletter law that the transportation of goods in commerce begins when they're given to a carrier and it only ends when they're received at their final destination. Indeed, this Court had repeatedly held that loading and unloading cargo specifically is part of that transportation, not ancillary to transportation or connected to transportation, but it is itself transportation, that it is itself commerce. And just the year before the FAA was passed, as Justice Kavanaugh pointed out, this Court held that it was too plain to require discussion that a worker who unloaded a train was a railroad employee and that that railroad employee was engaged in interstate commerce. Yet Southwest contends that workers who load and unload airplanes are not part of any class of workers engaged in commerce for purposes of the FAA. There's no support for this contention in the text of the statute. Southwest can't point to even a single example from any time period in which the phrase ""engaged in foreign or interstate commerce"" has ever been given the meaning it proposes.

Bostwick</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our nation's veterans benefits system is intended to be strongly and uniquely pro-claimant. In this non-adversarial system, veterans enjoy distinct procedural protections, and review of otherwise final decisions for Clear and Unmistakable Error, or CUE, is one of those unique protections. It prevents the agency's obvious errors from depriving veterans of the benefits to which their service entitles them. There is no dispute that a clear and unmistakable error has occurred when VA adjudicators misapply the terms of a plain statute. But the government seeks to impose an atextual exception to that general rule, that the agency does not clearly err when it enshrines its misapplication of law in a regulation. That cannot be correct. As this Court has said over and over, an agency regulation has the force of law only if it is consistent with Congress's command. And the government cannot deny this feature of our separation of powers, and its attempts to avoid it are unsuccessful. A VA adjudicator is directed to apply not only the agency's regulations but also Congress's statutes. When the regulation conflicts with the statute, the adjudicator cannot possibly follow both. But this dilemma created by the agency's own unlawful acts does not stop a later tribunal from identifying and remedying the clear legal error that infected the decision. Nor is this legal error a mere change in interpretation. VA's regulations have long distinguished between genuine legal changes that might warrant updating prior benefits rulings and legal errors that entitle veterans to revision of a flawed ruling. Furthermore, what the agency did here could not even colloquially be called an interpretation. VA's presumption of soundness regulation tracked the statute most of the way and then simply lopped off the end of the sentence, eliminating the second half of VA's two-part obligation.

That cannot be correct. As this Court has said over and over, an agency regulation has the force of law only if it is consistent with Congress's command. And the government cannot deny this feature of our separation of powers, and its attempts to avoid it are unsuccessful. A VA adjudicator is directed to apply not only the agency's regulations but also Congress's statutes. When the regulation conflicts with the statute, the adjudicator cannot possibly follow both. But this dilemma created by the agency's own unlawful acts does not stop a later tribunal from identifying and remedying the clear legal error that infected the decision. Nor is this legal error a mere change in interpretation. VA's regulations have long distinguished between genuine legal changes that might warrant updating prior benefits rulings and legal errors that entitle veterans to revision of a flawed ruling. Furthermore, what the agency did here could not even colloquially be called an interpretation. VA's presumption of soundness regulation tracked the statute most of the way and then simply lopped off the end of the sentence, eliminating the second half of VA's two-part obligation. It is not difficult to call that an error, and it is not difficult to say that denying Mr. George's claim based on this plainly invalid regulation was clearly and unmistakably erroneous.

2946,2021.21-234-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor,"Please let me finish my question, okay? This is one of them. We know that Congress writes statutes giving exemptions that it doesn't give in other areas because it does favor veterans. And whether you believe the veterans canon applies or not, the one thing it can -- one can say is you read it the way Congress wrote it, and if it wrote it in favor of veterans, you don't look for reasons to exempt veterans from the coverage it gives. So going back to Justice Thomas's question, I've read all the cases that you've given me, whether it's Berger, Wagner, Love. I do know that Love is a little bit unclear, but it favors Petitioner's side more than it favors yours. The veterans court there said there were two CUEs. It ended up deciding that the second CUE was more the ground for its decision, but it read it contrary to what you're saying it said. None of those other cases you've cited dealt with a situation identical to this one. They dealt with situations in which there were changes in law or changes in permissible regulatory interpretation. The only thing that favors you is what Justice Kavanaugh pointed to, which was that veteran -- the counsel's decision, but there is no evidence that Congress knew that when it -- when it adopted this CUE standard. And that veterans' counsel's decision admits that there are some disputes about what this means. And so I don't take it as much. It's telling us what it thinks it means, but I'm not sure that tells me what Congress thought it meant because it never referenced it. Having said all of that, I don't understand how you can claim that clear and unmistakable error in the decision made, in the statute, in the interpretation of the statute, even if it was compelled by the regulation at the time, it's disjunctive, error in the statute or error in the regulation.

Below, it seemed as though you were challenging the application of Reid and did not assume that even if Reid were properly applied that you would have a Confrontation Clause problem.","<speaker>Jeffrey L. Fisher</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A defendant cannot lose his right under the Confrontation Clause to exclude testimonial hearsay simply by making a legitimate defense based on admissible evidence, and that is true even if the hearsay the prosecution would like to introduce would supposedly contradict that defense. To the contrary, history and experience tell us that is when the clause's guarantee of cross-examination is at its most urgent. The state never directly disputes the legal propositions I just advanced. Instead, in the state's red brief, it advances for the first time a new argument never before made in this case. According to the state's new theory, Mr. Hemphill forfeited his confrontation rights because he made supposedly improper arguments at trial. And apart from this new theory's eleventh-hour appearance, there are two major problems. First, it finds no support in the record. The Joint Appendix is crystal-clear that the reason why the trial court admitted Morris's allocution was because Mr. Hemphill claimed Mr. Morris was the shooter. He advanced a third-party defense. And the state again and again asked to introduce Mr. Morris's allocution to refute that defense. And I'll turn the Court to Joint Appendix page 185, which is where, at the top of that page, the trial court summarizes its ruling. It says the defense's argument is in -- ""in all respects is appropriate and, under the circumstances of this case, probably a necessary argument to make."" But then the trial court says, ""Nonetheless, that argument opens the door to evidence offered by the state refuting the claim that Morris was, in fact, the shooter."" The second problem with the state's new theory is that it finds no support in New York law either. New York's ""opening a door"" theory has no impropriety requirement. Instead, all it requires is the evidence the prosecution seeks to introduce to be in conflict or contradiction to the defense -- defense's own evidence or the defense's arguments. And that's why the state itself admitted at pages 4 and 5 of its brief in opposition -- I'm sorry, of its brief in opposition in this Court, just like throughout the state courts, that the reason why Morris's allocution was admitted was because it contradicted the defense, not because of any supposed impropriety.

So Justice Kavanaugh has been asking you about how strict scrutiny would apply here, and Justice Kavanaugh said that the compelling interest that the State has is in the reduction of risk because, understandably, the State wants that risk to be zero because the consequences of a botched execution are quite high. I think how we define the compelling interest matters a lot for how the strict scrutiny analysis plays out. So I'm just wondering how you would characterize the State's interests. Would you characterize it the way that Justice Kavanaugh does, or do you have a different articulation of how you think the compelling interest should be described?","<speaker>Seth Kretzer</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Across Texas's 572 executions spanning four decades, the State's policy was to allow a spiritual advisor to be present in the execution chamber to lay hands on a condemned inmate and to audibly pray. In 2019, that long-standing practice changed suddenly when the State chose to forbid any religion advisor from the execution chamber. Ramirez and other inmates fought to preserve their religious exercise rights to spiritual advisor presence, and while these challenges proceeded, the State withdrew Ramirez's 2020 execution date in exchange for withdrawal of his Section 1983 petition. Six months later, the State reset Ramirez's execution, followed two months after that by a reversion to allowing in chambers spiritual advisor presence. The State then waited to reveal -- months more to reveal first a ban on touch; only later, it banned the writ -- spoken word. Either the State merely delayed revealing these new restrictions or, worse, added them piecemeal while Ramirez sought redress through the grievance system. Either way, the State's actions rendered that system unavailable under the PLRA. The State now argues that Ramirez's resort to litigation came somehow far too late but also six days too early. TDCJ's own history and practices, as well as the current approaches of the federal government and states like Alabama, prove that Texas's restrictions on touch and prayer are not the least restrictive means of furthering its proffered execution interests. Mr. Ramirez should prevail as a matter of law under RLUIPA. If the Court determines, however, that the State should be allowed another chance to attempt to meet its burden, this Court should remand for an evidentiary hearing in which both sides may develop the record.

RLUIPA, like RFRA, like the pre-Smith free exercise jurisprudence of this Court, requires an individualized determination. That's been the law for a long time. RFRA's been on the books for a long time. It's a completely workable standard. It's regrettable it wasn't extended to the Free Exercise Clause, but it is individualized. And what would be most helpful here, I think, is if we could at least identify sort of a gold standard, not to preclude individualized variations but a -- a -- something that will generally be sufficient to take into account religious demands regarding the two things that are at issue here, touching and vocalization, and accommodation of the State's interests. And we could look to the BOP, doesn't get to specify what the First Amendment requires or what RLUIPA requires, but it's a starting point. And so, if you -- you -- you've said what has happened in the past. If there are federal executions in the future, what will the BOP do? Will it -- will its policy be generally -- will its policy be no touching during the execution, vocalization allowed throughout the -- the -- the execution so long as it doesn't interfere with other communications that have to take place?","<speaker>Eric J.

And so, here, if -- if the prison defines the compelling interest in saying, like, well, we in Alabama want a zero percent risk or we in Texas want only a 2 percent risk, that permits them to -- to altogether bar the spiritual advisor from the chamber, right, because there's not going to be any, you know, lesser restrictive alternative that's going to get you there.

In 2019, that long-standing practice changed suddenly when the State chose to forbid any religion advisor from the execution chamber. Ramirez and other inmates fought to preserve their religious exercise rights to spiritual advisor presence, and while these challenges proceeded, the State withdrew Ramirez's 2020 execution date in exchange for withdrawal of his Section 1983 petition.

Number two, you were talking about the fact that you didn't understand his request in -- in June to ""touch and pray over me,"" that it would be verbal. How was he supposed to understand from the word ""observe"" in your April -- in your April 21 change of execution policy that ""observe"" meant no touching and no praying? Observing, it had happened before. So all I'm suggesting to you is you can defend your position. He's defended his. To me, prayer -- silent prayer, you don't have to ask permission for. I suspect that many of your people in that room, even though they're DOJ employees, also pray silently, and no one would question that their prayer would be in their head. So all I'm suggesting is lack of clarity exists on both sides, but you can fix yours by making your rules clearer. He tried to fix his by filing a grievance less than a month, weeks after you announced your policy on May 4. You returned his grievance saying your spiritual advisor can come. Weeks later, Petitioner's counsel e-mails you and asks you if touching will be allowed. June 11, three days later, Petitioner files his grievance and says ""allow Moore to touch and pray over me."" You deny that almost a month later, July 2. And on July 8, he files a grievance, but you don't respond to that over a month later. What were you doing six weeks later?","<speaker>Seth Kretzer</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Across Texas's 572 executions spanning four decades, the State's policy was to allow a spiritual advisor to be present in the execution chamber to lay hands on a condemned inmate and to audibly pray. In 2019, that long-standing practice changed suddenly when the State chose to forbid any religion advisor from the execution chamber. Ramirez and other inmates fought to preserve their religious exercise rights to spiritual advisor presence, and while these challenges proceeded, the State withdrew Ramirez's 2020 execution date in exchange for withdrawal of his Section 1983 petition. Six months later, the State reset Ramirez's execution, followed two months after that by a reversion to allowing in chambers spiritual advisor presence. The State then waited to reveal -- months more to reveal first a ban on touch; only later, it banned the writ -- spoken word. Either the State merely delayed revealing these new restrictions or, worse, added them piecemeal while Ramirez sought redress through the grievance system. Either way, the State's actions rendered that system unavailable under the PLRA. The State now argues that Ramirez's resort to litigation came somehow far too late but also six days too early. TDCJ's own history and practices, as well as the current approaches of the federal government and states like Alabama, prove that Texas's restrictions on touch and prayer are not the least restrictive means of furthering its proffered execution interests. Mr. Ramirez should prevail as a matter of law under RLUIPA. If the Court determines, however, that the State should be allowed another chance to attempt to meet its burden, this Court should remand for an evidentiary hearing in which both sides may develop the record.

He accordingly focuses on an altogether different issue, namely, whether he is entitled to outright release under this Court's decision in Zadvydas because his removal is not reasonably foreseeable. That argument would require modifying the judgment below, which afforded Respondent a bond hearing, not outright release. Because he did not file a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari, that argument is not properly presented here, and this Court should reject it for that reason alone. In any event, the argument is mistaken. Unlike in Zadvydas, the detention here pending a proceeding is not indefinite. It has a logical termination point, the conclusion of the proceeding. It therefore does not trigger the Zadvydas rule. This Court should reverse the judgment below.

DHS determined that Mr. Arteaga-Martinez had demonstrated a reasonable fear of torture if removed to his home country, a threshold standard that only 13 percent of applicants satisfy. That determination entitled him to immigration court adjudication of his claim for relief, which often takes a year or, as in this case, much longer, during which time he cannot be removed. After six months of detention, without any independent review, he had not yet even received a hearing on his withholding claim, let alone a decision or subsequent appeals, at the end of which he might not be removed at all. Now, three years later, the government still seeks the power to imprison him, despite his significant family ties and lack of any criminal record, pending his modified yet still unadjudicated withholding of removal claim. Section 1231(a)(6), as definitively construed in Zadvydas, forecloses his unchecked prolonged detention. The government responds that Zadvydas dealt only with the risk of permanent detention. Although that risk certainly raised due process concerns motivating the Court's statutory construction, its construction was not limited to that extreme scenario. Section 1231(a)(6) prohibits continued detention after six months where, as here, there is ""no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future,"" not at just some point ever.

The question presented in this case is whether that language requires that non-citizens detained under Section 1231(a)(6) be afforded a bond hearing before an immigration judge after six months of detention, at which the government bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the non-citizen is either a flight risk or a danger to the community. That question answers itself. Respondent implicitly recognizes the absence of any textual support for his position on the question presented. He accordingly focuses on an altogether different issue, namely, whether he is entitled to outright release under this Court's decision in Zadvydas because his removal is not reasonably foreseeable. That argument would require modifying the judgment below, which afforded Respondent a bond hearing, not outright release. Because he did not file a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari, that argument is not properly presented here, and this Court should reject it for that reason alone. In any event, the argument is mistaken. Unlike in Zadvydas, the detention here pending a proceeding is not indefinite. It has a logical termination point, the conclusion of the proceeding. It therefore does not trigger the Zadvydas rule. This Court should reverse the judgment below.

Prelogar</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Texas designed S.B. 8 to thwart the supremacy of federal law in open defiance of our constitutional structure. States are free to ask this Court to reconsider its constitutional precedents, but they are not free to place themselves above this Court, nullify the Court's decisions in their borders, and block the judicial review necessary to vindicate federal rights. As this case comes to the Court, there are three principal questions: First, is Texas responsible for this law? Second, can the United States sue to hold Texas to account? And, third, is the injunctive relief available? And the answer is yes down the line. Texas is responsible for the constitutional violation here. It enacted a law that clearly violates this Court's precedents. It designed that law to thwart judicial review by offering bounties to the general public to carry out the state's enforcement function, and it structured those enforcement proceedings to be so burdensome and to threaten such significant liability that they chill the exercise of the constitutional right altogether. The United States has a manifest sovereign interest in suing to redress this violation. S.B. 8 is a brazen attack on the coordinate branches of the federal government. It's an attack on the authority of this Court to say what the law is and to have that judgment respected across the 50 states. And it's an attack on Congress's determination that there should be access to pre-enforcement review in federal court to vindicate federal rights. The United States may sue to protect the supremacy of federal law against this attack. Finally, the injunction is a proper response to Texas's unprecedented law. If Texas can nullify Roe and Casey in this manner, then other states could do the same with other constitutional rights or other decisions of this Court that they disfavor.

Prelogar</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Texas designed S.B. 8 to thwart the supremacy of federal law in open defiance of our constitutional structure. States are free to ask this Court to reconsider its constitutional precedents, but they are not free to place themselves above this Court, nullify the Court's decisions in their borders, and block the judicial review necessary to vindicate federal rights. As this case comes to the Court, there are three principal questions: First, is Texas responsible for this law? Second, can the United States sue to hold Texas to account? And, third, is the injunctive relief available? And the answer is yes down the line. Texas is responsible for the constitutional violation here. It enacted a law that clearly violates this Court's precedents. It designed that law to thwart judicial review by offering bounties to the general public to carry out the state's enforcement function, and it structured those enforcement proceedings to be so burdensome and to threaten such significant liability that they chill the exercise of the constitutional right altogether. The United States has a manifest sovereign interest in suing to redress this violation. S.B. 8 is a brazen attack on the coordinate branches of the federal government. It's an attack on the authority of this Court to say what the law is and to have that judgment respected across the 50 states. And it's an attack on Congress's determination that there should be access to pre-enforcement review in federal court to vindicate federal rights. The United States may sue to protect the supremacy of federal law against this attack. Finally, the injunction is a proper response to Texas's unprecedented law.

States are free to ask this Court to reconsider its constitutional precedents, but they are not free to place themselves above this Court, nullify the Court's decisions in their borders, and block the judicial review necessary to vindicate federal rights. As this case comes to the Court, there are three principal questions: First, is Texas responsible for this law? Second, can the United States sue to hold Texas to account? And, third, is the injunctive relief available? And the answer is yes down the line. Texas is responsible for the constitutional violation here. It enacted a law that clearly violates this Court's precedents. It designed that law to thwart judicial review by offering bounties to the general public to carry out the state's enforcement function, and it structured those enforcement proceedings to be so burdensome and to threaten such significant liability that they chill the exercise of the constitutional right altogether. The United States has a manifest sovereign interest in suing to redress this violation. S.B. 8 is a brazen attack on the coordinate branches of the federal government. It's an attack on the authority of this Court to say what the law is and to have that judgment respected across the 50 states. And it's an attack on Congress's determination that there should be access to pre-enforcement review in federal court to vindicate federal rights. The United States may sue to protect the supremacy of federal law against this attack. Finally, the injunction is a proper response to Texas's unprecedented law. If Texas can nullify Roe and Casey in this manner, then other states could do the same with other constitutional rights or other decisions of this Court that they disfavor.

How about, dissatisfied with Lawrence versus Texas, subjects private consensual sexual conduct of which it disapproved to the exact same law as S.B. 8?

States are free to ask this Court to reconsider its constitutional precedents, but they are not free to place themselves above this Court, nullify the Court's decisions in their borders, and block the judicial review necessary to vindicate federal rights. As this case comes to the Court, there are three principal questions: First, is Texas responsible for this law? Second, can the United States sue to hold Texas to account? And, third, is the injunctive relief available? And the answer is yes down the line. Texas is responsible for the constitutional violation here. It enacted a law that clearly violates this Court's precedents. It designed that law to thwart judicial review by offering bounties to the general public to carry out the state's enforcement function, and it structured those enforcement proceedings to be so burdensome and to threaten such significant liability that they chill the exercise of the constitutional right altogether. The United States has a manifest sovereign interest in suing to redress this violation. S.B. 8 is a brazen attack on the coordinate branches of the federal government. It's an attack on the authority of this Court to say what the law is and to have that judgment respected across the 50 states. And it's an attack on Congress's determination that there should be access to pre-enforcement review in federal court to vindicate federal rights. The United States may sue to protect the supremacy of federal law against this attack. Finally, the injunction is a proper response to Texas's unprecedented law.

That understanding is consistent with the statutory text, context, and history, and it's also consistent with this Court's explanation in Kucana that the (B)(i) bar is limited to decisions made discretionary by legislation. Congress could have written (B)(i) differently. It could have barred review of any individual determination, as it did in subsection (A)(1), or of the final order of removal, as it did in subsection (C). But Congress didn't use those words. It used ""judgment"" and specifically ""any judgment regarding the granting of relief."" And nobody has identified any instance in which the INA uses ""judgment"" in the sweeping way suggested by the Eleventh Circuit. To the extent there's any doubt, though, it is resolved by the strong presumption of reviewability of agency action, and that's especially so because the Eleventh Circuit's position, undisputedly, bars all judicial review, even for errors of law, of the numerous adjustment-of-status decisions that are made outside of removal proceedings by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The Court-appointed amicus does not deny that or attempt to justify it. That's enough to resolve this case. The Court does not need to resolve the slight difference between our reading and the government's. We all agree it does not affect Mr. Patel's situation.

Congress could have written (B)(i) differently.

You can't make it broad at the same time because, otherwise, they would have used identical language. Second, I'm not sure how we ignore neighboring subsections (a) and (c) that show when Congress wanted to strip jurisdiction broadly in the way that you want it to -- you want it to strip both factual and legal jurisdiction -- Congress knew how to do that in (a) and (c), and it could have just copied that language.

Of course, Congress in 1924 took out moving, so that helps you. So I think just the ordinary understanding of ""use"" is not great for you, as the hypotheticals have illustrated. What helps you is the precedent of the SAA cases, which basically said that's not the way the term is being used in these statutes.

You -- you made compelling policy arguments, but there are parts of the Constitution's structure that people would want to change. The two senators per -- per state discriminates against people in larger states. Many of -- in some of those larger states have more minority population. The Electoral College gives you a slight, just a slight, but a slight advantage if you're in a smaller state. Delaware and Rhode Island, your vote for president counts a little more than your vote if you live in -- in New York or California, for example. And Article IV is -- is similar. I mean, it would take a constitutional amendment to change the first two that I mentioned, and, actually, the Constitution purports to change -- prohibit changes to the Senate, but we'll put that aside. But, here, it leaves it up to Congress. And Congress has the ability, the role to make changes over time, does not give that authority to this Court.

Flowers</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Jackson long ago warned against giving the convict population of the country new and unprecedented opportunities to litigate until they serve their sentences or make the best of increased opportunities to escape. The Sixth Circuit here blessed precisely the sort of opportunity he warned of. It held that when a federal statute prohibits ordering a prisoner's transportation with a writ of habeas corpus, courts may instead order transportation under the All Writs Act. But courts have no such power. Every All Writs order must be agreeable to the usages and principles of law, meaning the traditional writs as altered by statute. Transportation orders must be agreeable to habeas law because habeas writs were the only traditional writs used for ordering the transportation of prisoners.

But the order here was improper for a second reason regardless. Every All Writs Act order must be necessary or appropriate in aid of the issuing court's jurisdiction. The order here doesn't qualify because it evades the rules governing discovery in habeas cases and facilitates the development of evidence that no habeas court can even consider.

Flowers</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Jackson long ago warned against giving the convict population of the country new and unprecedented opportunities to litigate until they serve their sentences or make the best of increased opportunities to escape. The Sixth Circuit here blessed precisely the sort of opportunity he warned of. It held that when a federal statute prohibits ordering a prisoner's transportation with a writ of habeas corpus, courts may instead order transportation under the All Writs Act. But courts have no such power. Every All Writs order must be agreeable to the usages and principles of law, meaning the traditional writs as altered by statute. Transportation orders must be agreeable to habeas law because habeas writs were the only traditional writs used for ordering the transportation of prisoners. So, when a federal habeas statute prohibits ordering transportation with a writ of habeas corpus in a particular situation, courts may not evade that prohibition by issuing a transportation order under the All Writs Act. But the order here was improper for a second reason regardless. Every All Writs Act order must be necessary or appropriate in aid of the issuing court's jurisdiction. The order here doesn't qualify because it evades the rules governing discovery in habeas cases and facilitates the development of evidence that no habeas court can even consider.

First, the order here is conclusive. Second, the question whether the All Writs Act empowers a federal court to interfere with the sovereign's management of its own prisons is both important and separate from the merits.
