22021,2021.20-1775-t01,respondent,Neil Gorsuch,"And so you -- you agree that, therefore, the Northern District of Illinois erred when it issued a nationwide injunction?","<speaker>Brian H. Fletcher</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The 2019 Public Charge Rule did not regulate or confer any rights on the Petitioner states. Instead, Petitioners assert an indirect economic interest in the rule's downstream consequences. Relying on predictions that were made when the rule was drafted, they say that it would cause DHS to deny adjustment of status to people who would be more likely to use state-funded public benefits at some point in the future. But we now know that those predictions were wrong. During the year that the 2019 rule was in effect, we know that it affected only about five of the approximately 50,000 adjustment of status applications to which it was applied or about 1-100th of 1 percent. The states do not have a legally protectable interest in preserving that negligible indirect effect, and, even if it did, they could not justify intervention in appeals from preliminary injunctions that do not apply in Petitioners' jurisdictions and that now have no effect anywhere because the 2019 rule has been vacated in a separate final judgment. The court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in declining to allow Petitioners to prolong appeals that no longer have any practical consequence. And Petitioners' criticisms of the government's litigation conduct do not call for a different result. Congress made a policy choice to vest in the Department of Justice the decision whether to seek further review of decisions against the United States. This Court has emphasized that both the government and the courts benefit from that policy precisely because the solicitor general takes a selective approach and often decides against seeking further review, and as some of the questions this morning have suggested, it's not at all uncommon for the solicitor general to make that decision when the decision in question invalidated a regulation. Here, DHS had decided to issue a new Public Charge Rule. The ongoing litigation would have complicated that rulemaking and required intrusive discovery. The 2019 rule was not producing its intended effects, and the rule's unintended and unwanted effects were aggravated in the public health crisis. Now Petitioners disagree with the government's decision to dismiss its appeals when faced with those circumstances, but that disagreement does not allow them to revive this litigation that the government had decided was not in the best interests of the United States.

A third option is just nothing happens, the old rule is just gone, and the government keeps going without any replacement rule.

I guess I'm just wondering, would that be the narrowest basis of decision if -- if -- if the Court were to rule against you, that those are unique circumstances that might justify permissive intervention at least here?","<speaker>Brian H. Fletcher</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The 2019 Public Charge Rule did not regulate or confer any rights on the Petitioner states. Instead, Petitioners assert an indirect economic interest in the rule's downstream consequences. Relying on predictions that were made when the rule was drafted, they say that it would cause DHS to deny adjustment of status to people who would be more likely to use state-funded public benefits at some point in the future. But we now know that those predictions were wrong. During the year that the 2019 rule was in effect, we know that it affected only about five of the approximately 50,000 adjustment of status applications to which it was applied or about 1-100th of 1 percent. The states do not have a legally protectable interest in preserving that negligible indirect effect, and, even if it did, they could not justify intervention in appeals from preliminary injunctions that do not apply in Petitioners' jurisdictions and that now have no effect anywhere because the 2019 rule has been vacated in a separate final judgment. The court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in declining to allow Petitioners to prolong appeals that no longer have any practical consequence. And Petitioners' criticisms of the government's litigation conduct do not call for a different result. Congress made a policy choice to vest in the Department of Justice the decision whether to seek further review of decisions against the United States. This Court has emphasized that both the government and the courts benefit from that policy precisely because the solicitor general takes a selective approach and often decides against seeking further review, and as some of the questions this morning have suggested, it's not at all uncommon for the solicitor general to make that decision when the decision in question invalidated a regulation. Here, DHS had decided to issue a new Public Charge Rule. The ongoing litigation would have complicated that rulemaking and required intrusive discovery. The 2019 rule was not producing its intended effects, and the rule's unintended and unwanted effects were aggravated in the public health crisis. Now Petitioners disagree with the government's decision to dismiss its appeals when faced with those circumstances, but that disagreement does not allow them to revive this litigation that the government had decided was not in the best interests of the United States.

Coghlan</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court should reject the Special Master's conclusion that equitable apportionment is Mississippi's sole remedy because it's a remedy that redresses the wrong injury. Mississippi does not claim that Defendants are taking more than their fair share of groundwater. Rather, Mississippi's case turns on a different question: Do Defendants have the right to control groundwater while it is located within Mississippi's sovereign territory? And the Court has answered this question in Tarrant Regional Water District versus Herrmann. There, in considering an interstate surface river that had already been apportioned, the Court recognized an injury other than that of an upstream state harming a downstream state by taking too much water. Specifically, the Court recognized that one state may not divert water from another state's sovereign territory absent a waiver of that sovereignty. And, here, it's undisputed that Tennessee is diverting groundwater from Mississippi without Mississippi's permission and they do so knowingly. In the 1960s, the U.S. Geological Survey warned them it was happening. But rather than stop, Defendants opened new well fields within three miles of the border and substantially increased their pumping. As of 2014, when Mississippi filed its complaint, they had suctioned more than 400 billion gallons of groundwater across the border. They've increased the cost of Mississippi's own groundwater pumping. And by their own admission, Defendants' pumping is draining an overlying surficial aquifer that record evidence indicates is pulling contaminants down into the aquifer at issue in this case. Now the Special Master, in reaching its conclusions, asked whether the Middle Claiborne Aquifer was an interstate resource. This was the wrong question to ask because the answer doesn't matter.

Mississippi does not claim that Defendants are taking more than their fair share of groundwater. Rather, Mississippi's case turns on a different question: Do Defendants have the right to control groundwater while it is located within Mississippi's sovereign territory? And the Court has answered this question in Tarrant Regional Water District versus Herrmann. There, in considering an interstate surface river that had already been apportioned, the Court recognized an injury other than that of an upstream state harming a downstream state by taking too much water. Specifically, the Court recognized that one state may not divert water from another state's sovereign territory absent a waiver of that sovereignty. And, here, it's undisputed that Tennessee is diverting groundwater from Mississippi without Mississippi's permission and they do so knowingly. In the 1960s, the U.S. Geological Survey warned them it was happening. But rather than stop, Defendants opened new well fields within three miles of the border and substantially increased their pumping. As of 2014, when Mississippi filed its complaint, they had suctioned more than 400 billion gallons of groundwater across the border. They've increased the cost of Mississippi's own groundwater pumping. And by their own admission, Defendants' pumping is draining an overlying surficial aquifer that record evidence indicates is pulling contaminants down into the aquifer at issue in this case. Now the Special Master, in reaching its conclusions, asked whether the Middle Claiborne Aquifer was an interstate resource. This was the wrong question to ask because the answer doesn't matter. Even if the aquifer is an interstate resource, Mississippi still possesses sole and exclusive control over groundwater within its sovereign territory, as recognized in Tarrant and ensured by the Constitution, and Defendants cannot force groundwater across the border without violating this sovereignty.

Could you explain to me exactly what the offense is here that the government is prosecuting?,"<speaker>Lawrence S. Robbins</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Dr. Xiulu Ruan's jury was instructed that it could convict him of federal narcotics offenses if he prescribed ""outside the usual course of professional medical practice."" The Eleventh Circuit sustained that instruction precisely because it ""told the jury that good faith was a defense"" as long as the appellant's conduct also was in accordance with the standards of medical practice. In other words, good faith is a defense in the Eleventh Circuit only for doctors whose prescriptions are already lawful. No lawyer will stand up before the Court this morning and defend either that instruction or the court of appeals's rationale. And small wonder. Dr. Ruan received little more than the instruction he would have gotten had this been a civil malpractice action in Alabama. So, in our view, Dr. Ruan's case must be remanded, and on remand, the Eleventh Circuit should either dismiss this prosecution outright for want of sufficient proof of Alabama substantive standards or, at a minimum, order a new trial on all counts, this time governed by the correct scienter rule. And that rule, we submit, which largely tracks the law in the First, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits, is that a doctor may not be convicted under Section 841(a)(1) unless the government proves that her prescriptions were made without a good-faith medical purpose. The good-faith medical purpose test makes the best sense of the statutory text, this Court's case law. It also accords with principles of federalism that are embedded in the statute itself, enables the jury to focus on the question of intent, as it always does in criminal cases, and affords an appropriate berth for doctors and patients to make the best choices for the individual care of what is often invisible and yet real and intractable pain.

It is punishable by 20 years, which is what Respondent received in this case for his attempted and conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery. What it does not show is an attempt to use force, the actual use of force, or a threat to use force. To get around that reality, the government distorts the meaning of ""use of force"" and ""threatened use of force"" and adopts a very unorthodox meaning of ""attempt liability."" It argues that attempted threats are attempted uses of force, positing a meaning of ""use of force"" that contradicts this Court's cases.

Why wouldn't you just sanction the State of Florida if you think they're out of compliance?","<speaker>Vivek Suri</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our position does not turn on any distinction between past and future medical expenses. It instead turns on who paid for those expenses. Medicaid is entitled to the portions of the recovery that correspond to the things Medicaid paid for, and the beneficiary gets the portions of the recovery that correspond to the things the beneficiary paid for. Justice Thomas, you asked about how this would work in the context of child support or medical support provided by a parent. Our answer is that it would work the same way. The same kind of allocation would have to be made. Justice Alito, you asked how this would work in the context of payments that are made after the settlement. I agree that's something that can happen, although it's unusual, and in that case, as I've said, we draw no distinction between past and future payments. The entitlement would turn entirely on who made the payment. Justice Kagan, you asked about the word ""available"" in (A). And we agree that the word ""available"" can be read to mean theoretically available. But the key language here is not in (A). It's in (B). (B) is the provision that specifies the pool of funds from which the recovery can be obtained. And that's at the very end of (B) where it says ""to the extent of such legal liability."" But, if you look earlier in (B), it says such a legal liability is found to exist after medical assistance has been made available on behalf of the individual. And that makes clear that we're not talking about theoretical availability. We're talking about actually being made available. In addition, if you look at page 7A of our brief, there's a regulation, 42 C.F.R. 433.138, which interprets (A) itself to apply to services that are furnished and not merely available under the plan. Justice Kavanaugh, you asked about the Medicare analogy, and I don't think that analogy really helps in this context. That's because Medicare adopts the system that was rejected in Ahlborn. In other words, it's not the case that Medicare takes the pool of money that is attributable to future medical expenses. Rather, it takes from the entire pool of the settlement. And now -- we think it's rational for Congress to have done one of two things. You could say you limit the -- the government to the pool of money that corresponds to the funds that have actually been paid for by Medicaid, and that would be fair to the beneficiary. Alternatively, you could say that the government could take the entire settlement. That would be less fair to the beneficiary, but it avoids the administrative costs and hassle of having these allocation determinations. But what's less understandable is why Congress would have adopted the middle ground that Florida wants, where you have the administrative expense of these allocation proceedings, but you also don't have the fairness to the beneficiary because Medicaid is going beyond the pool that corresponds to the funds that Medicaid itself has paid for. In many ways, it's the worst of all worlds. Justice Gorsuch, you had asked about Section 1983 and how that would apply here. The federal government agrees that the Court shouldn't reach that issue in this case. It's a difficult issue about how Section 1983 should be interpreted. There are also complications about whether it should be under Section 1983 or Ex parte Young. We'd urge the Court to reserve that case -- that issue for future cases. Justice Breyer, your hypothetical involved Smith and Jones and Smith getting to pay I think it was 15,000 out of the 25,000. How does Medicaid recover the remaining 10,000? I think the way to deal with that is, first, the state could go after the tortfeasor directly. It has multiple avenues for doing that. It's received an assignment. It could use that assignment to bring the suit in the first place. Second, after the suit has been brought by the private individual, the state could intervene in that case. Third, after the settlement has been reached, the state could say we're not a party to that settlement and we still want to sue the individual for the remaining money, and in that suit, the state could ask for the full extent of its expenses. But what the state is doing here is it's not going after the tortfeasor. It's going after the victim of the accident, and it's seeking funds that don't correspond to the things it paid for. We think that's exactly what the anti-lien clause prevents the state from doing. If there are any other questions, I welcome them.</text>",2021

Are you in agreement with him?","<speaker>Vivek Suri</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our position does not turn on any distinction between past and future medical expenses. It instead turns on who paid for those expenses. Medicaid is entitled to the portions of the recovery that correspond to the things Medicaid paid for, and the beneficiary gets the portions of the recovery that correspond to the things the beneficiary paid for. Justice Thomas, you asked about how this would work in the context of child support or medical support provided by a parent. Our answer is that it would work the same way. The same kind of allocation would have to be made. Justice Alito, you asked how this would work in the context of payments that are made after the settlement. I agree that's something that can happen, although it's unusual, and in that case, as I've said, we draw no distinction between past and future payments. The entitlement would turn entirely on who made the payment. Justice Kagan, you asked about the word ""available"" in (A). And we agree that the word ""available"" can be read to mean theoretically available. But the key language here is not in (A). It's in (B). (B) is the provision that specifies the pool of funds from which the recovery can be obtained. And that's at the very end of (B) where it says ""to the extent of such legal liability."" But, if you look earlier in (B), it says such a legal liability is found to exist after medical assistance has been made available on behalf of the individual. And that makes clear that we're not talking about theoretical availability. We're talking about actually being made available. In addition, if you look at page 7A of our brief, there's a regulation, 42 C.F.R. 433.138, which interprets (A) itself to apply to services that are furnished and not merely available under the plan. Justice Kavanaugh, you asked about the Medicare analogy, and I don't think that analogy really helps in this context. That's because Medicare adopts the system that was rejected in Ahlborn. In other words, it's not the case that Medicare takes the pool of money that is attributable to future medical expenses. Rather, it takes from the entire pool of the settlement. And now -- we think it's rational for Congress to have done one of two things. You could say you limit the -- the government to the pool of money that corresponds to the funds that have actually been paid for by Medicaid, and that would be fair to the beneficiary. Alternatively, you could say that the government could take the entire settlement. That would be less fair to the beneficiary, but it avoids the administrative costs and hassle of having these allocation determinations. But what's less understandable is why Congress would have adopted the middle ground that Florida wants, where you have the administrative expense of these allocation proceedings, but you also don't have the fairness to the beneficiary because Medicaid is going beyond the pool that corresponds to the funds that Medicaid itself has paid for. In many ways, it's the worst of all worlds. Justice Gorsuch, you had asked about Section 1983 and how that would apply here. The federal government agrees that the Court shouldn't reach that issue in this case. It's a difficult issue about how Section 1983 should be interpreted. There are also complications about whether it should be under Section 1983 or Ex parte Young. We'd urge the Court to reserve that case -- that issue for future cases. Justice Breyer, your hypothetical involved Smith and Jones and Smith getting to pay I think it was 15,000 out of the 25,000. How does Medicaid recover the remaining 10,000? I think the way to deal with that is, first, the state could go after the tortfeasor directly. It has multiple avenues for doing that. It's received an assignment. It could use that assignment to bring the suit in the first place. Second, after the suit has been brought by the private individual, the state could intervene in that case. Third, after the settlement has been reached, the state could say we're not a party to that settlement and we still want to sue the individual for the remaining money, and in that suit, the state could ask for the full extent of its expenses. But what the state is doing here is it's not going after the tortfeasor. It's going after the victim of the accident, and it's seeking funds that don't correspond to the things it paid for. We think that's exactly what the anti-lien clause prevents the state from doing. If there are any other questions, I welcome them.</text>",2021

Justice Thomas, you asked about how this would work in the context of child support or medical support provided by a parent. Our answer is that it would work the same way. The same kind of allocation would have to be made. Justice Alito, you asked how this would work in the context of payments that are made after the settlement. I agree that's something that can happen, although it's unusual, and in that case, as I've said, we draw no distinction between past and future payments. The entitlement would turn entirely on who made the payment. Justice Kagan, you asked about the word ""available"" in (A). And we agree that the word ""available"" can be read to mean theoretically available. But the key language here is not in (A). It's in (B). (B) is the provision that specifies the pool of funds from which the recovery can be obtained. And that's at the very end of (B) where it says ""to the extent of such legal liability."" But, if you look earlier in (B), it says such a legal liability is found to exist after medical assistance has been made available on behalf of the individual. And that makes clear that we're not talking about theoretical availability. We're talking about actually being made available. In addition, if you look at page 7A of our brief, there's a regulation, 42 C.F.R. 433.138, which interprets (A) itself to apply to services that are furnished and not merely available under the plan. Justice Kavanaugh, you asked about the Medicare analogy, and I don't think that analogy really helps in this context. That's because Medicare adopts the system that was rejected in Ahlborn. In other words, it's not the case that Medicare takes the pool of money that is attributable to future medical expenses. Rather, it takes from the entire pool of the settlement. And now -- we think it's rational for Congress to have done one of two things. You could say you limit the -- the government to the pool of money that corresponds to the funds that have actually been paid for by Medicaid, and that would be fair to the beneficiary. Alternatively, you could say that the government could take the entire settlement. That would be less fair to the beneficiary, but it avoids the administrative costs and hassle of having these allocation determinations. But what's less understandable is why Congress would have adopted the middle ground that Florida wants, where you have the administrative expense of these allocation proceedings, but you also don't have the fairness to the beneficiary because Medicaid is going beyond the pool that corresponds to the funds that Medicaid itself has paid for. In many ways, it's the worst of all worlds. Justice Gorsuch, you had asked about Section 1983 and how that would apply here. The federal government agrees that the Court shouldn't reach that issue in this case. It's a difficult issue about how Section 1983 should be interpreted. There are also complications about whether it should be under Section 1983 or Ex parte Young. We'd urge the Court to reserve that case -- that issue for future cases. Justice Breyer, your hypothetical involved Smith and Jones and Smith getting to pay I think it was 15,000 out of the 25,000. How does Medicaid recover the remaining 10,000? I think the way to deal with that is, first, the state could go after the tortfeasor directly. It has multiple avenues for doing that. It's received an assignment. It could use that assignment to bring the suit in the first place. Second, after the suit has been brought by the private individual, the state could intervene in that case. Third, after the settlement has been reached, the state could say we're not a party to that settlement and we still want to sue the individual for the remaining money, and in that suit, the state could ask for the full extent of its expenses. But what the state is doing here is it's not going after the tortfeasor. It's going after the victim of the accident, and it's seeking funds that don't correspond to the things it paid for.

24505,2021.20-1263-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Justice Barrett? Thank you, counsel. General Whitaker?","<speaker>Vivek Suri</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our position does not turn on any distinction between past and future medical expenses. It instead turns on who paid for those expenses. Medicaid is entitled to the portions of the recovery that correspond to the things Medicaid paid for, and the beneficiary gets the portions of the recovery that correspond to the things the beneficiary paid for. Justice Thomas, you asked about how this would work in the context of child support or medical support provided by a parent. Our answer is that it would work the same way. The same kind of allocation would have to be made. Justice Alito, you asked how this would work in the context of payments that are made after the settlement. I agree that's something that can happen, although it's unusual, and in that case, as I've said, we draw no distinction between past and future payments. The entitlement would turn entirely on who made the payment. Justice Kagan, you asked about the word ""available"" in (A). And we agree that the word ""available"" can be read to mean theoretically available. But the key language here is not in (A). It's in (B). (B) is the provision that specifies the pool of funds from which the recovery can be obtained. And that's at the very end of (B) where it says ""to the extent of such legal liability."" But, if you look earlier in (B), it says such a legal liability is found to exist after medical assistance has been made available on behalf of the individual. And that makes clear that we're not talking about theoretical availability. We're talking about actually being made available. In addition, if you look at page 7A of our brief, there's a regulation, 42 C.F.R. 433.138, which interprets (A) itself to apply to services that are furnished and not merely available under the plan. Justice Kavanaugh, you asked about the Medicare analogy, and I don't think that analogy really helps in this context. That's because Medicare adopts the system that was rejected in Ahlborn. In other words, it's not the case that Medicare takes the pool of money that is attributable to future medical expenses. Rather, it takes from the entire pool of the settlement. And now -- we think it's rational for Congress to have done one of two things. You could say you limit the -- the government to the pool of money that corresponds to the funds that have actually been paid for by Medicaid, and that would be fair to the beneficiary. Alternatively, you could say that the government could take the entire settlement. That would be less fair to the beneficiary, but it avoids the administrative costs and hassle of having these allocation determinations. But what's less understandable is why Congress would have adopted the middle ground that Florida wants, where you have the administrative expense of these allocation proceedings, but you also don't have the fairness to the beneficiary because Medicaid is going beyond the pool that corresponds to the funds that Medicaid itself has paid for. In many ways, it's the worst of all worlds. Justice Gorsuch, you had asked about Section 1983 and how that would apply here. The federal government agrees that the Court shouldn't reach that issue in this case. It's a difficult issue about how Section 1983 should be interpreted. There are also complications about whether it should be under Section 1983 or Ex parte Young. We'd urge the Court to reserve that case -- that issue for future cases. Justice Breyer, your hypothetical involved Smith and Jones and Smith getting to pay I think it was 15,000 out of the 25,000. How does Medicaid recover the remaining 10,000? I think the way to deal with that is, first, the state could go after the tortfeasor directly. It has multiple avenues for doing that. It's received an assignment. It could use that assignment to bring the suit in the first place. Second, after the suit has been brought by the private individual, the state could intervene in that case. Third, after the settlement has been reached, the state could say we're not a party to that settlement and we still want to sue the individual for the remaining money, and in that suit, the state could ask for the full extent of its expenses. But what the state is doing here is it's not going after the tortfeasor. It's going after the victim of the accident, and it's seeking funds that don't correspond to the things it paid for. We think that's exactly what the anti-lien clause prevents the state from doing. If there are any other questions, I welcome them.</text>",2021

Morris</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Circuit recognized a new cause of action based on an elected body censuring a member. That decision is wrong for two reasons. First, it ignores this country's history and parliamentary tradition, which recognize the right of elected bodies to govern their own affairs, including censuring members for violations of governance rules. And, second, it makes the Free Speech Clause into both a cudgel and a shield. The Free Speech Clause undeniably protects a member's right to criticize the body upon which they sit, but it does not insulate the member from the elected body's speech in response. Wilson basically concedes the Board's right to respond to his violations of its governance rules with its own speech when he argues the Board could have passed a position statement calling his behavior inappropriate, indecorous, and regrettable as long as it didn't use the words ""censure"" or ""punishment."" But the Free Speech Clause doesn't dictate what words an elected body can use to reprimand one of its members, and elected bodies enforce rules with discipline, not position statements. Wilson focuses instead on three additional measures that were included in the resolution of censure, but this case involves only speech. The Fifth Circuit relied on censure alone in creating its new cause of action, and whatever might be true in other contexts, that holding is wrong in the context of this case. Allowing retaliation actions based on censures will destabilize legislative self-governance, forcing courts to referee local political disputes. Judges will be asked to draw unmanageable lines between a politician's speech and conduct or legislative and non-legislative speech. And boards like HCC's will have to shy away from enforcing their rules of governance because of the threat of litigation. This is not the right result. As Judge Ho said, the First Amendment protects freedom of speech, not freedom from speech. We ask this Court to hold that a member of an elected body may not sue for retaliation on a censure alone.

The Free Speech Clause undeniably protects a member's right to criticize the body upon which they sit, but it does not insulate the member from the elected body's speech in response. Wilson basically concedes the Board's right to respond to his violations of its governance rules with its own speech when he argues the Board could have passed a position statement calling his behavior inappropriate, indecorous, and regrettable as long as it didn't use the words ""censure"" or ""punishment."" But the Free Speech Clause doesn't dictate what words an elected body can use to reprimand one of its members, and elected bodies enforce rules with discipline, not position statements. Wilson focuses instead on three additional measures that were included in the resolution of censure, but this case involves only speech. The Fifth Circuit relied on censure alone in creating its new cause of action, and whatever might be true in other contexts, that holding is wrong in the context of this case. Allowing retaliation actions based on censures will destabilize legislative self-governance, forcing courts to referee local political disputes. Judges will be asked to draw unmanageable lines between a politician's speech and conduct or legislative and non-legislative speech. And boards like HCC's will have to shy away from enforcing their rules of governance because of the threat of litigation. This is not the right result.

Mr. Kimberly.","<speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A censure resolution adopted by an elected body against one of its members does not abridge that member's freedom of speech. Elected bodies in our Anglo-American legal tradition have long entered disciplinary actions against their members, including for those members' speech, with no suggestion that it violated principles of free speech. More to the point, Congress, since 1791, has censured and even expelled its members for their private speech: the 1797 expulsion of Senator Blount, the 1844 censure of Senator Tappan, and even a 2019 House resolution condemning the private speech of one of its members. In none of those instances was there any suggestion that those disciplinary actions abridged the member's freedom of speech within the meaning of the First Amendment. Now, as this Court has held in a variety of contexts, including the First Amendment, that kind of constitutional history is essentially dispositive and easily resolves the question presented in this case. Alternatively, you could view the censure here as a form of governmental speech, which, under this Court's cases, therefore doesn't violate anyone else's free speech rights. But, either way, this Court should reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</text>",2021

What would be your -- your response to that?","<speaker>Richard A. Morris</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Circuit recognized a new cause of action based on an elected body censuring a member. That decision is wrong for two reasons. First, it ignores this country's history and parliamentary tradition, which recognize the right of elected bodies to govern their own affairs, including censuring members for violations of governance rules. And, second, it makes the Free Speech Clause into both a cudgel and a shield. The Free Speech Clause undeniably protects a member's right to criticize the body upon which they sit, but it does not insulate the member from the elected body's speech in response. Wilson basically concedes the Board's right to respond to his violations of its governance rules with its own speech when he argues the Board could have passed a position statement calling his behavior inappropriate, indecorous, and regrettable as long as it didn't use the words ""censure"" or ""punishment."" But the Free Speech Clause doesn't dictate what words an elected body can use to reprimand one of its members, and elected bodies enforce rules with discipline, not position statements. Wilson focuses instead on three additional measures that were included in the resolution of censure, but this case involves only speech. The Fifth Circuit relied on censure alone in creating its new cause of action, and whatever might be true in other contexts, that holding is wrong in the context of this case. Allowing retaliation actions based on censures will destabilize legislative self-governance, forcing courts to referee local political disputes. Judges will be asked to draw unmanageable lines between a politician's speech and conduct or legislative and non-legislative speech. And boards like HCC's will have to shy away from enforcing their rules of governance because of the threat of litigation. This is not the right result.

The law includes robust exceptions for a woman's life and health. It leaves months to obtain an abortion. Yet, the courts below struck the law down. It didn't matter that the law apply -- that the law applies when an unborn child is undeniably human, when risks to women surge, and when the common abortion procedure is brutal. The lower courts held that because the law prohibits abortions before viability, it is unconstitutional no matter what. Roe and Casey's core holding, according to those courts, is that the people can protect an unborn girl's life when she just barely can survive outside the womb but not any earlier when she needs a little more help. That is the world under Roe and Casey. That is not the world the Constitution promises. The Constitution places its trust in the people. On hard issue after hard issue, the people make this country work. Abortion is a hard issue. It demands the best from all of us, not a judgment by just a few of us.

There has been some difference of opinion with respect to undue burden, but the right of a woman to choose, the right to control her own body, has been clearly set for -- since Casey and never challenged. You want us to reject that line of viability and adopt something different. Fifteen justices over 50 years have -- or I should say 30 since Casey have reaffirmed that basic viability line. Four have said no, two of them members of this Court. But 15 justices have said yes, of varying political backgrounds. Now the sponsors of this bill, the House bill, in Mississippi, said we're doing it because we have new justices. The newest ban that Mississippi has put in place, the six-week ban, the Senate sponsors said we're doing it because we have new justices on the Supreme Court.

It didn't matter that the law apply -- that the law applies when an unborn child is undeniably human, when risks to women surge, and when the common abortion procedure is brutal. The lower courts held that because the law prohibits abortions before viability, it is unconstitutional no matter what. Roe and Casey's core holding, according to those courts, is that the people can protect an unborn girl's life when she just barely can survive outside the womb but not any earlier when she needs a little more help. That is the world under Roe and Casey. That is not the world the Constitution promises. The Constitution places its trust in the people. On hard issue after hard issue, the people make this country work. Abortion is a hard issue. It demands the best from all of us, not a judgment by just a few of us.

You know, we have Plessy, Brown. We have Bowers versus Hardwick, to Lawrence. But, in thinking about stare decisis, which is obviously the core of this case, how should we be thinking about it -- I mean, Justice Breyer pointed out that in Casey and in some respects, well, it was a different conception of stare decisis insofar as it very explicitly took into account public reaction. Is that a factor that you accept, or are you arguing that we should minimize that factor?

25754,2021.19-1392-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett,"Ms. Rikelman, I have a question about the safe haven laws. So Petitioner points out that in all 50 states, you can terminate parental rights by relinquishing a child after abortion, and I think the shortest period might have been 48 hours if I'm remembering the data correctly. So it seems to me, seen in that light, both Roe and Casey emphasize the burdens of parenting, and insofar as you and many of your amici focus on the ways in which forced parenting, forced motherhood, would hinder women's access to the workplace and to equal opportunities, it's also focused on the consequences of parenting and the obligations of motherhood that flow from pregnancy. Why don't the safe haven laws take care of that problem? It seems to me that it focuses the burden much more narrowly. There is, without question, an infringement on bodily autonomy, you know, which we have in other contexts, like vaccines. However, it doesn't seem to me to follow that pregnancy and then parenthood are all part of the same burden. And so it seems to me that the choice more focused would be between, say, the ability to get an abortion at 23 weeks or the state requiring the woman to go 15, 16 weeks more and then terminate parental rights at the conclusion.

In June Medical more recently, the Court splintered on -- on -- on that same question, whether benefits could be considered or only burdens.

25775,2021.19-1392-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"And I want to ask a question about stare decisis and to think about how to approach that here because there have been lots of questions picking up on Justice Barrett's questions and others. And history helps think about stare decisis, as I've looked at it, and the history of how the Court's applied stare decisis, and when you really dig into it, the history tells a somewhat different story, I think, than is sometimes assumed. If you think about some of the most important cases, the most consequential cases in this Court's history, there's a string of them where the cases overruled precedent. Brown v. Board outlawed separate but equal. Baker versus Carr, which set the stage for one person/one vote. West Coast Hotel, which recognized the states' authority to regulate business. Miranda versus Arizona, which required police to give warnings when the right to -- about the right to remain silent and to have an attorney present to suspects in criminal custody. Lawrence v. Texas, which said that the state may not prohibit same-sex conduct. Mapp versus Ohio, which held that the exclusionary rule applies to state criminal prosecutions to exclude evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Giddeon versus Wainwright, which guaranteed the right to counsel in criminal cases. Obergefell, which recognized a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. In each of those cases -- and that's a list, and I could go on, and those are some of the most consequential and important in the Court's history -- the Court overruled precedent. And it turns out, if the Court in those cases had -- had listened, and they were presented in -- with arguments in those cases, adhere to precedent in Brown v. Board, adhere to Plessy, on West Coast Hotel, adhere to Atkins and adhere to Lochner, and if the Court had done that in those cases, you know, this -- the country would be a much different place. So I assume you agree with most, if not all, the cases I listed there, where the Court overruled the precedent. So the question on stare decisis is why, if -- and I know you disagree with what about I'm about to say in the ""if"" -- if we think that the prior precedents are seriously wrong, if that, why then doesn't the history of this Court's practice with respect to those cases tell us that the right answer is actually a return to the position of neutrality and -- and not stick with those precedents in the same way that all those other cases didn't?","<speaker>Julie Rikelman</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mississippi's ban on abortion two months before viability is flatly unconstitutional under decades of precedent.

And the second trimester ends at 27 weeks. And so that state supreme court says, we think that the right exists, you know, in a -- in a -- in an absolute sense, that the state cannot take away the right up to 27 weeks and then after that adopts an undue burden standard.

Brecht, in turn, asks whether there is more than a reasonable possibility the error contributed to the verdict. Comparing the standards, where there is more than a reasonable possibility the error contributed to the verdict, as is the case here, no fair-minded jurist could agree there is no reasonable possibility the error contributed to the verdict. Put differently, a fair-minded jurist confronted with more than a reasonable possibility of harm could not find the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. That relationship between the standards was recognized by this Court in Fry and again in Ayala, and it's also been recognized in the practical experience of federal courts applying these standards for more than 20 years. Through multiple rounds of briefing, the state has never identified a single case in which Brecht was satisfied but AEDPA/Chapman was not satisfied. Therefore, where a finding of actual prejudice under Brecht has been made and that finding does not rest on sources of law that would not be permissible to consider under 2254(d), the Brecht inquiry answers the AEDPA questions.

Mr. Davenport was actually prejudiced by the unconstitutional shackling, as the court of appeals found under Brecht. The state has not sought review of that Brecht determination before this Court. The finding of actual prejudice necessarily means the state court adjudication on the merits was an unreasonable application of the Chapman standard. There is a clear and logical relationship between Brecht and AEDPA/Chapman, with Brecht setting the higher hurdle.

Klein</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me start by making one thing clear. I'm not planning to ask did it happen in Poland. The Polish prosecutor already has information about that and doesn't need U.S. discovery on the topic. What he does need to know is what happened inside Abu Zubaydah's cell between December 2002 and September 2003. So I want to ask simple questions like, how was Abu Zubaydah fed? What was his medical condition? What was his cell like? And, yes, was he tortured? These topics are declassified. The government has allowed Mitchell and Jessen to testify about them publicly twice before, in the Salim case and before military commissions. They testified about Abu Zubaydah's treatment in general and at particular sites outside Poland. They testified about another detainee's treatment at the Polish site identified by code name. The government itself placed their testimony online. The government's briefs make no pretense that these topics are privileged. The remand directs the district court only to consider whether classified and declassified information can be separated. It does not require discovery. It leaves that to the district court. If the district court does allow discovery, then it can use the same tools it used in Salim to protect state secrets, and, yes, Justice Barrett, I do believe that the government would be in attendance just as it was in the Salim case and would be able to object. It could enter an order limiting deposition topics. It could have depositions proceed under seal. And it can propose -- it can postpone answers to any questions that -- that draw objection until the -- until the court has ruled on them. Poland would receive only a record approved by the court after appropriate objections and perhaps even another appeal. This is what courts do, and it's what they do well.

Fletcher</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our nation's covert intelligence partnerships depend on our partners' trust that we will keep those relationships confidential. Respondents seek discovery that would compel a breach of that trust by confirming or denying the existence of an alleged CIA facility in Poland, and Respondents seek that discovery not to vindicate any rights under U.S. law but, instead, in a discretionary Section 1782 application aimed at sending evidence abroad to a foreign investigation whose very purpose is to reveal and prosecute the alleged involvement of Polish officials in covert CIA activities. The CIA director explained why that compelled disclosure would seriously harm the national security. The Ninth Circuit should have afforded deference to that expert judgment, and it failed to do so because it made two fundamental legal errors. First, the Ninth Circuit undertook its own inquiry into whether the existence of the alleged facility was a secret given public speculation on that subject. But, under this Court's decision in Reynolds, the question is not whether a court thinks that the information sought is secret in some abstract sense; it is whether compelled disclosure will harm the national security. That is a question that squarely implicates the CIA director's special knowledge and expertise. And, here, the CIA director explained that compelled disclosure would harm the national security because there's a critical difference between speculation, even widespread speculation, and formal confirmation by people with firsthand knowledge. Even the Ninth Circuit appeared to recognize the force of that point, and it did not suggest that Respondents could have had the discovery they seek here from the CIA itself. Instead -- and this was the Court's second error -- it held that two former contractors can be compelled to confirm or deny the existence of the facility under oath because they are not agents of the United States. But, again, the question is not the contractors' status under domestic law; it is how their compelled testimony would affect national security.

26178,2021.20-1573-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"Well, let's put that aside, however the courts interpret it. Now let's go to the second point. In 1925, there were plenty of representative actions, arbitrations. 1925, there were railroad arbitrations that were representative arbitrations. There were navigation, maritime arbitrations. There were agricultural arbitrations. All of them were representative. All of them were complex. We don't have a rule that says arbitration's incapable of dealing with complex cases. We have permitted arbitration in RICO cases, in securities cases, in antitrust cases, in sexual harassment cases. All of those cases involve very complex issues with proof related to parties other than the individuals bringing them, involving in RICO patterns of RICO activity, of racketeering that involve multiple layers of crimes. In sexual harassment and disparate impact claims, we have to have the plaintiff prove what happens to a bunch of other people. So, when you say to me that complexity or multiple proof is incompatible with arbitration, it's not incompatible. We haven't said you can't, with the permission of parties, litigate a class action with the permission -- I'm sorry, arbitrate class action. We let parties make that choice. The question here for me is not whether the case is too complex. I don't see it as incompatible, PAGA incompatible. The question is the one that Justice Kagan raised, which is how do we read a substantive state law, a substantive cause of action by a state that says, if you do something, this is the penalty, this is the amount you pay us? The mechanism we're going to collect is going to be the PAGA mechanism. But I don't see anything in the FAA that says we preempt that, because they're not anti-arbitration. You can do it in arbitration or you can do it in litigation, your choice. And you say: But it's really not a choice. I'm never going to -- me, the employer, is never going to permit this in arbitration. Well, that may or may not be true. Some employers might choose it. But, on the other hand, if you preclude employees from bringing it in arbitration, you're precluding the state from having an effective enforcement mechanism because each individual employee is not going to have a financial incentive to bring these suits on behalf of the state. That's what you're banking on. You're banking on destroying the state's mechanism for enforcing its law -- for enforcing labor law violations, aren't you?","<speaker>Paul D.

We all know what the best policy is. I mean, by this point, two years later, we know that the best way to prevent spread is for people to get vaccinated and to prevent dangerous illness and death is for people to get vaccinated. That is by far the best. The second best is to wear masks. So this is a policy that basically says, we are still confronting thousands of people dying every time we look around, and so we're going to put into place the policy that we know works best, which is to strongly incentivize vaccination and to insist that unvaccinated people will wear masks and test. I mean, that's just -- like, why isn't that necessary? What else should be done? It's -- it's obviously the policy that's -- that's geared to preventing most sickness and death, and the agency has done everything but stand on its head to show quite clearly that no other policy will prevent sickness and death to anywhere like the degree this one will.","<speaker>Scott A.

That's because OSHA's economy-wide mandate would cause permanent worker displacement rippling through our national economy, which is already experiencing labor shortages and fragile supply lines.

In fact, the June healthcare COVID ETS and the 1991 bloodborne pathogen rule both rejected vaccine mandates and widespread testing, and those were even just for targeting healthcare workers. And, here, OSHA's vaccine-and-testing mandate treats virtually all industries' workplaces and workers the same. But even Congress's rescue plan identified high-risk workplaces, and OSHA itself here recited state data confirming that certain industries, like healthcare and correction facilities, are higher risk. Our nation's businesses have distributed and administered hundreds of millions of COVID vaccines to Americans. Businesses have encouraged and incentivized their employees to get vaccines.

And I think that that's right. I think that that is the question. Respectfully, I -- I think it has a different answer than the one that you give, so I'll just sort of put a different version of it to you, which is, you know, you're -- I'm sure you're right that there are all kinds of public health and economic tradeoffs that have to be made in a policy like this, all kinds of judgments on the public health side, on the economic side, how those two things ought to be balanced against each other. So who decides? Should it be the agency full of expert policymakers and completely politically accountable through the President? This is not the kind of policy in which there's no political accountability. If people like this policy, they'll go to the polls and vote it that way. If people don't like it, they'll vote that way. This is a publicly -- a politically accountable policy. It also has the virtue of expertise. So, on the one hand, the agency with their political leadership can decide. Or, on the other hand, courts can decide. Courts are not politically accountable. Courts have not been elected. Courts have no epidemiological expertise.

What the Secretary said was ""employees who are unvaccinated are in grave danger from SARS COVID virus, but employees who are fully vaccinated are not."" So the -- the purpose -- if this is to be sustained, it has to be on the ground that it presents a grave danger to unvaccinated workers who have chosen to be unvaccinated.

And unvaccinated people -- and the agency has shown in its studies that unvaccinated people affect other unvaccinated people. And they vary in age and can be of ages and of conditions where the effect will be serious, if not death. So we're not talking -- I -- I -- I don't know how comparing apples to oranges in terms of the risk factors makes any sense.

And the major questions doctrine kind of regulates that interaction between Congress and agencies. So it's not that judges are supposed to decide some question of public health. It's about regulating the rules of the system to ensure that the appropriate party does. And so the question in my mind really turns a lot on the major questions doctrine in this case. Is this one that has been given to the agencies to decide or one that Congress has to make as a major question under our federal system? And I haven't heard a lot of discussion about that.

U.S. Postal Service told OSHA that this ETS's requirements are so burdensome for employers that the federal government is now seeking an exemption from its own mandate for the Postal Service. That's because OSHA's economy-wide mandate would cause permanent worker displacement rippling through our national economy, which is already experiencing labor shortages and fragile supply lines. OSHA has never before mandated vaccines or widespread testing, much less across all industries. In fact, the June healthcare COVID ETS and the 1991 bloodborne pathogen rule both rejected vaccine mandates and widespread testing, and those were even just for targeting healthcare workers. And, here, OSHA's vaccine-and-testing mandate treats virtually all industries' workplaces and workers the same. But even Congress's rescue plan identified high-risk workplaces, and OSHA itself here recited state data confirming that certain industries, like healthcare and correction facilities, are higher risk. Our nation's businesses have distributed and administered hundreds of millions of COVID vaccines to Americans. Businesses have encouraged and incentivized their employees to get vaccines. But a single federal agency tasked with occupational standards cannot commandeer businesses economy-wide into becoming de facto public health agencies. So this Court should immediately stay OSHA's unprecedented ETS before Monday, when OSHA begins enforcement. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2021

U.S. Postal Service told OSHA that this ETS's requirements are so burdensome for employers that the federal government is now seeking an exemption from its own mandate for the Postal Service. That's because OSHA's economy-wide mandate would cause permanent worker displacement rippling through our national economy, which is already experiencing labor shortages and fragile supply lines. OSHA has never before mandated vaccines or widespread testing, much less across all industries. In fact, the June healthcare COVID ETS and the 1991 bloodborne pathogen rule both rejected vaccine mandates and widespread testing, and those were even just for targeting healthcare workers. And, here, OSHA's vaccine-and-testing mandate treats virtually all industries' workplaces and workers the same. But even Congress's rescue plan identified high-risk workplaces, and OSHA itself here recited state data confirming that certain industries, like healthcare and correction facilities, are higher risk. Our nation's businesses have distributed and administered hundreds of millions of COVID vaccines to Americans. Businesses have encouraged and incentivized their employees to get vaccines. But a single federal agency tasked with occupational standards cannot commandeer businesses economy-wide into becoming de facto public health agencies. So this Court should immediately stay OSHA's unprecedented ETS before Monday, when OSHA begins enforcement. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2021

And as I -- I see it, there are sort of two ways that such a doctrine could operate. One is with respect to ambiguous statutes, ambiguous either because they're vague or because there are statutes that seem to have conflicting provisions, you know, where they point both ways, and then the major questions doctrine is an aid to interpretation of that statute. It's essentially a kind of clue about how you should interpret a very difficult-to-understand statute. And the second way is there's really nothing difficult to understand about this. The agency action falls within the scope of the statutory authority. There's just no question that it does. And yet, because the agency action is kind of a big deal, we're just going to ignore the fact that it falls clearly within the scope of the delegated authority and say that, notwithstanding that that's true, Congress has to re-up it.

26526,2021.21A244-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch,"Yes. So my -- my question with respect to the major questions doctrine is this: We accept that it's not our role to decide public health questions, but it is our important job to decide who should decide those questions. I think we all agree on that. And, here, our choice on the one hand is a federal agency and on the other hand the Congress of the United States and state governments. Now you argue we should not consider the major questions doctrine unless and until we find a statutory ambiguity. I understand that. But let's -- let's say the Court does find such an ambiguity. I know you'll contest the premise, but let's just work on it. If -- if there is an ambiguity, why isn't this a major question that, therefore, belongs to the people's representatives of the states and in the halls of Congress, given that the statute at issue here is, as the Chief Justice pointed out, 50 years old, doesn't address this question. The rule affects, I believe, we're told, 80 million people, and the government reserves the right to extend it to every private business in the country. Traditionally, states have had the responsibility for overseeing vaccination mandates. I rejected a challenge to one just the other day from New Mexico. Congress has had a year to act on the question of vaccine mandates already. As the Chief Justice points out, it appears that the federal government is going agency by agency as a workaround to its inability to get Congress to act. The risks imposed here are not unilateral. There are risks to those who choose not to be vaccinated that they're trying to avoid sometimes, as you discussed with Justice Alito and conceded to him. Traditionally, OSHA has had rules that affect workplace hazards that are unique to the workplace and don't involve hazards that affect individuals 24 hours a day. So that's kind of the general tick list we have before us, and I'd just like you to address, again, the question, assuming the statute's ambiguous, why isn't this a major question that normally under our Constitution would reserve -- be reserved for the people's representatives in the states in the first instance and in the halls of Congress in the second?","<speaker>Scott A.

26531,2021.21A244-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett,"General Prelogar, I have two questions, both of which address the status of this rule as an emergency temporary standard. So my first question has to do with the question with which Justice Thomas opened, which is the meaning of ""necessary."" So, of course, when OSHA passes a rule through its regular regulatory process, it has to go through notice and comment, and that's a way of holding an agency accountable. All affected people have an opportunity to comment, and the agency develops a robust record. With an ETS, of course, the agency can circumvent that process so that it can act more quickly. So, for an ETS, we would want that power to be the exception, not the rule. And one contrast that the Applicants point out between OSHA's authority to issue an ETS versus a regular regulation is that for its exercise of power in the normal course, it need only find that a regulation be reasonably necessary, but, for an ETS, it has to satisfy a necessary standard. Now you've argued, and I think there's a lot of intuitive appeal to this, that when you're facing an emergency of the magnitude of this pandemic, that this power effectively -- can be used most effectively as a blunt instrument. You know, we don't have time to make industry by industry specific kind of calculations because we want to move with speed.

So Chief Judge Sutton pointed out in his dissent from the denial of initial en banc that OSHA did not adopt this rule in response to the emergency qua emergency because that had been ongoing since early 2020, but, instead, it responded to new facts on the ground, which included the widespread availability of a vaccine, that maybe it was a surprise many people chose to forgo, and the emergence of the Delta variant. And Chief Judge Sutton pointed out that in an extended pandemic, or I don't know if we've moved to an endemic, such as this one, facts will continually change. New variants will emerge. There might be new treatments, new vaccinations. We have boosters now, right? So now full vaccination might not just be the two jabs; it might include a booster as well. So when does the emergency end? I mean, a lot of this argument has been about Congress's failure to act. Two years from now, do we have any reason to think that COVID will be gone or that new variants might not be emerging?

See</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Section 111 of the Clean Air Act, Congress directed EPA to partner with the states to regulate on a source-specific level, which means identifying measures particular buildings can take to reduce their own emissions. The D.C. Circuit gave EPA much broader power, power to reshape the nation's energy sector, or most any other industry for that matter, by choosing which sources should exist at all and setting standards to make it happen. No tools of statutory construction support that result. First, electricity generation is a pervasive and essential aspect of modern life and squarely within the states' traditional zone. Yet, EPA can now regulate in ways that cost billions of dollars, affect thousands of businesses, and are designed to address an issue with worldwide effect. This is major policymaking power under any definition. And though Respondents argue EPA can resolve these questions unless clearly forbidden, this Court's precedents are clear that's backward. Unless Congress clearly authorizes it, Section 111 does not stretch so far, and Congress hasn't done so here. Second, the words Congress did use in the context where it placed them confirms Section 111's traditional scope. Read together, key statutory terms like ""the requirement standards before individual sources"" and ""focused on their performance"" show that Congress did not green-light this transformative power. And, finally, standing is no reason to avoid the merits. We're injured by a judgment that brings back to life a rule that hurts us and that takes off the books a rule that benefits us.

An existing source that has installed the best available technology. That's in at least two provisions.

All of our other cases, whether it's regulation of tobacco or regulation of evictions under major questions doctrine have not addressed the how. Now we're going to the how, and you want us to look at the how. Now Justice Kagan said inside-the-fence-line requirements themselves can lead to generation shifting because some of those could be so expensive that they force generation shifting. So, if that's the case, how do we define this major question? It can't be that what Congress has chosen might lead in or outside the fence because there's some out-of-fence activities that don't necessarily lead to generation system changing.

But I -- I hear you making a kind of different argument, and I just want to make sure that I'm reading you right because you're saying not from the agency perspective but instead from the power plant perspective something along the lines of: If you do anything about the way power plants operated, which maybe we do and maybe we don't, but you would know that we do these kinds of outside-the-fence things all the time and that it's a sensible way for all of us to proceed and that if you took that away, you would be essentially -- you know, it's not surprising because that's what the industry does.

Justice Thomas asked you where we get the authority to even impose these standards on the courts of appeal. And I think we've treated it as the lower court having some inherent authority just pursuant to the judicial power to manage its docket, and I heard you saying that we have the authority to make sure that the rules that the courts adopt and apply are not abuses of their discretion, and that would be true whether we're talking about pre-judgment or post-judgment intervention. And -- and our role in that regard is pretty limited. I have a question specifically about how we should think about that relationship in the context of a post-judgment intervention motion because we've also asserted that we have some inherent supervisory authority over the courts of appeal. And in the post-judgment intervention context, we might also have some concern that wouldn't be present in the pre-judgment context about a court of appeals trying to evade our review.

Was the Attorney General retained as a party or dismissed as a party?,"<speaker>Alexa Kolbi-Molinas</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Attorney General agreed to be bound by final judgment and chose not to appeal it. Because he was expressly bound by the judgment, he had a right to appeal, but he had to do so within the 30-day timeframe set by statute. He cannot now avoid his jurisdictional failure by seeking to intervene instead. The Attorney General does not directly dispute that one who is bound by judgment and fails to appeal cannot intervene. Instead, he offers two responses, both insufficient. First, he argues that he is exempt from jurisdictional rules because he is wearing a different hat on appeal than he wore when he agreed to be bound. But the Attorney General was sued and bound in his official capacity, and the fact that a party has more than one job responsibility does not allow it to evade a jurisdictional bar. Second, the Attorney General argues that by reserving all rights, claims, and defenses relating to whether he is a proper party, he reserved the right to participate in the appeal. But you can only reserve the rights that are available to you, and there's no right to join an appeal after failing to satisfy the jurisdictional rules for doing so. However, even if intervention were not jurisdictionally barred, the court of appeals should be affirmed. Intervention is not a revolving door that allows a party to agree to be bound, procure their dismissal, fail to appeal, and then gain reentry to the suit after the court of appeals has ruled. Moreover, where the Attorney General was on notice of his interest in preserving the third-party standing argument nearly a year before the court of appeals ruled and did nothing about it, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying post-judgment intervention when it was based primarily on that argument. Finally, it is not disrespectful to the Attorney General's and Kentucky's sovereign interests to hold the Attorney General to his decision not to appeal, particularly when he can make the same arguments he made in his intervention motion through Rule 60(b).

28316,2021.20-601-t01,respondent,Amy Coney Barrett,"Counsel, can I ask you a question about the premise of the jurisdictional argument altogether? I guess I'm struggling to see why 28 U.S.C. 2107 is the right way to think about this, because it doesn't seem to me that intervention necessarily overlaps with 2107. I mean, he's not filing a notice of appeal. He's seeking to intervene. It seems like a different thing. And it might be that the fact that he styled -- signed this stipulation before might be an equitable reason or one of the considerations in this intervention calculation, the Rule 24 analog for why the court might not let him do it. Like a court might say: Hey, you had your chance, you signed that away. No, we're not letting you come in at this late date. But I guess I don't understand why it's jurisdictional, because it seems to me that a motion to intervene is just a different way of getting before the suit. So are you aware of any other cases in which a court of appeals has treated a motion to intervene as implicating 2107 at all? Because, I mean, after all, in the language in 2107(a), it just says ""unless notice of appeal is filed within 30 days."" So, presumably, even if you came in as a stranger to the suit, someone not in the Attorney General's strange two-hat position here, would anyone invoke 2107 saying, well, hey, even though you weren't a party below and you didn't have the right to appeal, it was 30 days and that 30 days has run? It just seems like a mismatch between what happened and -- and 2107.","<speaker>Alexa Kolbi-Molinas</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Attorney General agreed to be bound by final judgment and chose not to appeal it. Because he was expressly bound by the judgment, he had a right to appeal, but he had to do so within the 30-day timeframe set by statute. He cannot now avoid his jurisdictional failure by seeking to intervene instead. The Attorney General does not directly dispute that one who is bound by judgment and fails to appeal cannot intervene. Instead, he offers two responses, both insufficient. First, he argues that he is exempt from jurisdictional rules because he is wearing a different hat on appeal than he wore when he agreed to be bound. But the Attorney General was sued and bound in his official capacity, and the fact that a party has more than one job responsibility does not allow it to evade a jurisdictional bar. Second, the Attorney General argues that by reserving all rights, claims, and defenses relating to whether he is a proper party, he reserved the right to participate in the appeal. But you can only reserve the rights that are available to you, and there's no right to join an appeal after failing to satisfy the jurisdictional rules for doing so. However, even if intervention were not jurisdictionally barred, the court of appeals should be affirmed. Intervention is not a revolving door that allows a party to agree to be bound, procure their dismissal, fail to appeal, and then gain reentry to the suit after the court of appeals has ruled. Moreover, where the Attorney General was on notice of his interest in preserving the third-party standing argument nearly a year before the court of appeals ruled and did nothing about it, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying post-judgment intervention when it was based primarily on that argument. Finally, it is not disrespectful to the Attorney General's and Kentucky's sovereign interests to hold the Attorney General to his decision not to appeal, particularly when he can make the same arguments he made in his intervention motion through Rule 60(b).

Only the Fifth and Tenth go the government's way with an obvious legal error. As Justice Kavanaugh pointed out, the Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh call it any legal error. I'm really not sure what the difference means or why. What I am concerned about is those circuits that permit 60(b)(6) motions when there's been a change in law or an intervening change in the law that renders the initial judgment based on overruled or changed laws. We've even done it in Buck under 60(b)(6). How do we write this opinion to avoid barring that, meaning do we have to write it the Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh way or the Fifth and Tenth way? But how do we avoid opining on that inadvertently? Because it can't be all legal errors where the government suggests that are obvious or not obvious.","<speaker>Andrew L.

My friend dismisses that understanding as limited to default judgment cases. But nothing in Section 473 distinguished between default cases and other cases, and the California Supreme Court squarely recognized that Section 473 covered mistakes of law made outside the default judgment context. As to the distinction between mistakes by parties and mistakes by courts, it's true that the original version of Rule 60(b) covered only mistakes by the movant himself. But, in 1946, the rule was amended to remove any textual limitation on whose mistakes could provide a basis for relief. My friend speculates that the advisory committee still silently intended to exclude judicial mistakes. But that speculation has no grounding in the text of the rule. If the committee had wanted to exclude judicial mistakes as a basis for relief from judicial orders, it would surely have said so expressly. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2021

Stewart</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Appellees' suit should be dismissed for lack of standing, but if the Court reaches the merits, it should reverse the district court's judgment and hold that the statutory loan repayment limit is constitutional. Appellees lack standing for two reasons. First, although they have directed their challenge to the statutory loan repayment limit, Appellees stipulated below that the first $250,000 of Senator Cruz's loan was repaid with pre-election funds. The statute therefore does not currently restrict the Senator's ability to obtain full repayment of his loan. Second, the current regulatory barrier to repayment is self-inflicted. Appellees could have avoided any injury simply by behaving exactly as they would have if the statute and regulation did not exist. Instead, they went out of their way to engage in transactions that would -- they would not otherwise have undertaken, solely to subject the Senator to a financial loss and thereby lay the groundwork for a lawsuit. That deliberate self-infliction of injury for no purpose other than to facilitate litigation severed the causal link between the challenged laws and Senator Cruz's injury. On the merits, the loan repayment limit is constitutional. It imposes insubstantial burdens on the financing of electoral campaigns, and it targets a practice that has significant corruptive potential. A post-election contributor generally knows which candidate has won the election, and post-election contributions do not further the usual purposes of donating to electoral campaigns.

Stewart</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Appellees' suit should be dismissed for lack of standing, but if the Court reaches the merits, it should reverse the district court's judgment and hold that the statutory loan repayment limit is constitutional. Appellees lack standing for two reasons. First, although they have directed their challenge to the statutory loan repayment limit, Appellees stipulated below that the first $250,000 of Senator Cruz's loan was repaid with pre-election funds. The statute therefore does not currently restrict the Senator's ability to obtain full repayment of his loan. Second, the current regulatory barrier to repayment is self-inflicted. Appellees could have avoided any injury simply by behaving exactly as they would have if the statute and regulation did not exist. Instead, they went out of their way to engage in transactions that would -- they would not otherwise have undertaken, solely to subject the Senator to a financial loss and thereby lay the groundwork for a lawsuit. That deliberate self-infliction of injury for no purpose other than to facilitate litigation severed the causal link between the challenged laws and Senator Cruz's injury.

So it's not going to be an expenditure to promote your speech in electing the candidate. So my normal reaction is, why do you give after an election to a candidate who's not going to spend it on getting elected? He's going to spend it on something in the past but certainly nothing with respect to the actual election and his getting his post. And, to me, that's a natural quid pro quo. I'm giving because I want to draw my attention to you. I guess I'm having a hard time understanding your counter-argument that that needs to be somehow proven. I mean, there were studies that the court below discounted. I'm not quite sure what the ground -- complete ground of discounting -- it wasn't enough, basically. But, you know, they showed that voting patterns by senators seemed to tie into post-election contributions.

That limitation applies regardless of the nature of the action or claim, so it is not limited to constitutional challenges, and any such limit would only encourage plaintiffs to do what happened here, seek to avoid the bar by advancing implausible statutory constructions under the guise of constitutional avoidance. Moreover, the statute's exception for orders granting relief to an individual alien against whom removal proceedings have been initiated does not permit class-wide relief simply because every current or future member of a class could have qualified for individual relief. That would be inconsistent with Congress's concern about allowing lower courts to remake the immigration system under readings that have not been adopted by this Court. And this Court has stated as much about the exception in 1252(f)(1) three times, most recently in Jennings, as the Third Circuit recognized in its decision two weeks ago in Brito.

I mean, you're suggesting an approach where it's like it's not 1983; it's habeas. Oh, sorry, in habeas, you run into the second and successive bar. You're just never going to be able to bring these claims. Or maybe I should say almost never. And it seems as though that's exactly what Bucklew said should not happen. Bucklew, all nine justices agreed on one point, which is that somebody in Mr. Nance's position was entitled to raise a alternative method of execution that had not been authorized by state law. And the Court said we see little likelihood that an inmate facing a serious risk of pain will be unable to identify an available alternative for that reason, because he was entitled to identify an alternative that was not authorized. There was a concurrence that really underscored that point. And -- and now you're saying, oh, well, you know, really, Bucklew didn't mean what it said, notwithstanding that it said an -- an -- a petitioner is always going to be able to do this. What we meant was a petitioner is technically always going to be able to do this, but in 90 percent, 99 percent of the time, he's not going to have an appropriate vehicle. Now is that really a -- a reading of Bucklew that would not be, I don't know, embarrassing?","<speaker>Matthew S. Hellman</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mr. Nance's claim sounds in Section 1983 because it is a claim about how the state may execute him, not a claim that the state cannot execute him. That simple proposition decides this case, and, indeed, when the case began, Respondents did not dispute it. Respondents' new contention that some method-of-execution cases sound in habeas is wrong, wrong about the scope of the writ, wrong about the scope of Section 1983, and wrong under this Court's method-of-execution case law. Proposing a non-statutory method of execution is proposing a method of execution. By its very nature, the claim does not attack the validity of the death sentence, which places it squarely on the 1983 side of the line that this Court has demarcated. And that is particularly so because Mr. Nance is required to prove that the state has a feasible and readily available alternative means of carrying out the execution. It would stretch habeas beyond recognition to hold that it applies to a claim that not only concedes the validity of the sentence but proves that the state has a feasible means of carrying it out. Respondents, of course, are free to dispute the feasibility of the firing squad as an alternative method, but that feasibility analysis is part of the Section 1983 merits inquiry, just as it is with the feasibility inquiry for any other proposed method.

In my estimation, budgets are generally passed by law. The laws have to be changed, and the Court says it's unconstitutional not to do. The state does what it needs to do. Similarly, just in Americans for Prosperity Foundation last year, in a 1983 action, we said a California regulation was not a permissible remedy, enjoining a California regulation. All of these things require changes either in state statutory law or regulatory law, and we've never suggested that curing a violation on its face because a law prohibits something stops a 1983. But I just experienced in the news Florida changing its law with respect to one of its state citizens in a matter of weeks, if not days.

Kavanaugh,"And second question, don't take it the wrong way, but if you were to lose in this case, is it better for the State of Georgia to lose on the 1983 point or to lose on the second or successive point?","<speaker>Matthew S. Hellman</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mr. Nance's claim sounds in Section 1983 because it is a claim about how the state may execute him, not a claim that the state cannot execute him. That simple proposition decides this case, and, indeed, when the case began, Respondents did not dispute it. Respondents' new contention that some method-of-execution cases sound in habeas is wrong, wrong about the scope of the writ, wrong about the scope of Section 1983, and wrong under this Court's method-of-execution case law. Proposing a non-statutory method of execution is proposing a method of execution. By its very nature, the claim does not attack the validity of the death sentence, which places it squarely on the 1983 side of the line that this Court has demarcated. And that is particularly so because Mr. Nance is required to prove that the state has a feasible and readily available alternative means of carrying out the execution. It would stretch habeas beyond recognition to hold that it applies to a claim that not only concedes the validity of the sentence but proves that the state has a feasible means of carrying it out. Respondents, of course, are free to dispute the feasibility of the firing squad as an alternative method, but that feasibility analysis is part of the Section 1983 merits inquiry, just as it is with the feasibility inquiry for any other proposed method. Any other result would mire method-of-execution litigation in threshold questions about whether a proposed alternative is truly non-statutory. The result would be confusion, delay, and arbitrariness. More than that, Respondents' rule would close the courthouse doors to the very claim that all nine members of the Bucklew Court held should not be unduly difficult to bring.

That's what the Chavez plurality said, reiterating pre-Dickerson holdings that Miranda violations result in no constitutional deprivation, that's Payne, and no identifiable constitutional harm, that's Elstad. Tekoh and the Ninth Circuit say that Dickerson abandoned these cases. But, in fact, Dickerson reaffirmed their limits on Miranda's scope.

So there was inherent tension in Dickerson, and Chief Justice Rehnquist said we're not overruling Miranda and we're living with that tension but never characterized it as a right.

29670,2021.20-219-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","I -- I understand the analogy to contract law, but what's necessary in the spending law context? I mean, you can't just go and say, you know, the court of appeal in Montana had decided this case and gave emotional distress damages; therefore, in any case under the Spending Clause, the recipient is subjected to those damages. I mean, what we have here is, as I understand it, a fairly narrow category of compensatory damages in a very narrow -- well, a narrow category of cases. But let's say it's a hundred percent of those cases. I mean, how many of those issues -- those cases have to be present before you can say that a recipient is bound by that under -- under Section 504 or the other categories?","<speaker>Andrew Rozynski</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Circuit categorically prohibited emotional distress damages in all instances under Spending Clause statutes prohibiting discrimination. Based on Franklin and Barnes, that decision is wrong. Franklin held that compensatory damages are available, and Barnes reaffirmed that holding. Emotional distress damages are the most common and often the only form of compensatory damage remedy for victims of intentional discrimination. Barnes held that remedies are available under the statutes here. They are traditionally available under contract law. Emotional distress damages are indeed recoverable in breach-of-contract cases for the type of conduct at issue here. As Section 353 of the Second Restatement and all the leading treatises cited in Barnes explain, when a contract's breach is of such a kind that serious emotional disturbance was a particularly likely result, then recovery for emotional disturbance is allowed. Premier has not and cannot dispute that serious emotional disturbance is a particularly likely result of intentional discrimination. Premier asks this Court to disregard the Restatement rule, but there is no basis to do so. The particularly-likely-result concept has been long a fixture of the law, and virtually all courts agree that in contract cases involving places of public accommodations, improper denial of access traditionally gives rise to emotional distress damages.

29671,2021.20-219-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett,"The treatises -- the treatises all identify a very narrow -- the general rule is that emotional distress is not part of compensatory damages for breaches of contract, so they're a very narrow category of cases, as the Chief Justice said, including, you know, the -- the telegram cases and disposal-of-dead-body cases and marriage contract. And the best cases for you are the innkeeper and common carrier cases. So how close is that analogy, the analogy that you're trying to draw? It seems to me that you would need to kind of draw a pretty strong analogy to that particular category, wouldn't you?","<speaker>Andrew Rozynski</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Circuit categorically prohibited emotional distress damages in all instances under Spending Clause statutes prohibiting discrimination.

29673,2021.20-219-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"Can I ask about the contract analogy, because it does seem difficult, as Justice Barrett's identifying. And one of the ways I've thought about this case is to try to compare it to the express causes of action. So this is an implied cause of action, as Justice Barrett pointed out. The express causes of action that you highlight do allow these kinds of damages, so that's a -- that's a plus for you in -- in my evaluation of your case. But Congress has put caps on -- on those damages in Title VII, the graduated caps, and that becomes a minus for you because are we supposed to allow uncapped liability in the implied cause of action? That seems a problem to create inconsistency with the express cause of action. Or are we supposed to put caps into the implied cause of action? That starts to seem very legislative and too legislative probably for the Court.

29674,2021.20-219-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"Some of the amici point to very large recoveries, and I think that that's what Justice Kavanaugh is referring to. And so what he's concerned about is that under Title VII there's limits for discrimination. If we recognize emotional distress damages here, there are no limits. So there would be a disparity between Title VII and discrimination here. Why should we accept that disparity?
