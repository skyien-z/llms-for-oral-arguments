826,2002.01-705-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","--It was one of the purposes, yes, and it was one that Congress said, spend a year trying to make these assignments. But then we've got to launch this fund and-- What is really going on here is that the commissioner wants to do a different sort of job than Congress delegated to her. This is the sort of project... and I think this is a critical distinction from the deadlines in Pierce County and those sorts of cases. The agency could have done a reasonably good job on this project in 4 months, a better job in a year, maybe a nearly perfect job in 5 years. Congress said, we want the 1-year version. Why do we want the 1-year version and not the nearly perfect version? Because the miners are going to get the same benefits either way. Coal companies or funds established by coal companies are going to pay for them either way.","<speaker>Barbara B. McDowell</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Coal Act states that the Commissioner of Social Security shall, before October 1st, 1993, assign each beneficiary to a signatory coal operator or related person that remains in business. That provision understood, in light of this Court's precedents, establishes the deadline that is mandatory but not jurisdictional. It does not deprive the commissioner of the power or the obligation to complete the assignments after that date, if necessary. That understanding comports with the text and structure of the Coal Act, as well as with... with one of its central purposes, that to the maximum extent possible, each coal retiree's benefits would be paid for by a coal operator that actually employed that miner or a related person.</text>",2002
18768,2002.02-516-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas,"Mr. Payton, do you think that your admissions standards overall at least provide some headwind to the efforts that you're taking about?","<speaker>Kirk O. Kolbo</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher were denied admission to the University of Michigan's flagship undergraduate institution, the College of Literature and the Science and the Arts under an admissions... under admissions policies that facially and flagrantly discriminated on the basis of race. The history of their case and of the University's defense of its discriminatory admissions policies is a powerful argument about the perils of entrusting to the discretionary judgments of educators the protection of the Constitution's guarantee of equality to all individuals. For nearly 5 years, the University vigorously defended in the district court and the court of appeals the admissions systems that were in place when petitioners Gratz and Hamacher applied. These systems featured separate admissions guidelines for different races, protected or reserved seats in the class for select minorities, that is blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans, racially-segregated wait lists, and a policy of never automatically rejecting students from their preferred... from the preferred minority groups while doing so for others.</text>",2002

Ms. Mahoney said earlier that the problem of law school admissions, in response to Justice O'Connor, that it was for the elite schools, it was more a problem at the elite schools, when she was talking about Boalt Hall, for example, you meant... you suggested or alluded to in your argument today that, you know, you don't want to choose between being an elite school and the whole diversity issue. It... would it be easier to accomplish the latter if the former were adjusted, that is the overall admissions standard?","<speaker>Kirk O.

Dreeben</speaker><text>Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Virginia has singled out cross-burning with the intent to intimidate because it is a particularly threatening form of such conduct. History has revealed that cross-burning has been used as a tool to intimidate and put people in fear of bodily violence in a way that no other symbol has been used.</text>",2002

37572,2002.01-729-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I think it is very important to place the various points that have been touched on this morning in the proper legal framework. The question, Justice Kennedy, is not whether it's burdensome to require someone to fill out a form and verify it. The question is, is that so punitive that you don't believe the legislature when it says that we're doing this to prevent future harm? The question, Justice Ginsburg, is not whether it might be a better system if it included other information, or whether that would be too burdensome for the State. The question is, does the failure to put on ameliorative information convince you that the legislature was simply not telling the truth when it said we're doing this to prevent future harm? And the question is not whether you should have an individualized determination or a group determination. It is, is the group determination so irrational that you think the legislature was not really interested in preventing future harm, it was just doing this to punish? In fact, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, this Court has never found a law with a civil regulatory purpose to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.","<speaker>Theodore B. Olson</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress and the legislatures of 50 States have agreed that citizens should have access to truthful information concerning the identity and location of convicted sex offenders.</text>",2002
