Specifically, the Court held that the initial magistrate's determination is -- is entitled to great deference, and that you will go behind that only in cases where the officer falsified information or omitted exculpatory information, where the affidavit was bare-bones, or there was some indication that the judicial officer did not perform the function, and then a catch-all provision, where the warrant was so lacking in indicia of probable cause that no reasonable officer could even submit it for a magistrate's determination. And specifically in Malley, the Court said it had to be the actions of an officer that was plainly incompetent or knowingly violating the law. This case arises from a Ninth Circuit decision that we submit does not apply the Court's standards, under circumstances where the officer submitted, far from a bare-bones affidavit, but a highly detailed, factual affidavit that we submit provided probable cause for the search or at least, under the Court's qualified immunity jurisprudence, a reasonable officer could believe that the warrant had probable cause.</text>",2011

They are policy choices and there are many factors that can be taken into account in drawing a map: How compact you want the districts to be, to what extent are you going to respect zones of economic interest, to what extent are you going to try to preserve old districts, what about incumbents, what about party registration? Are you going to try to have balance or are you going to try to favor one party or the other? That's all -- those are all questions of policy. And the question is who makes those policy decisions?

Interpretive services are potentially large, although you claim that they don't -- they have sort of a terminus point.

I was in the Southern District of New York. And fees there without translation, just for the oral courtroom work, sometimes went ahead for months. So potentiality's not the question. If you're talking about disproportionality, then that goes to the word ""reasonable"" in the statute, doesn't it? I mean, the Ortho case you point to, the court did sizably cut the translation fees. And more importantly, from the little I can tell, that was a huge patent case with a patent that was claimed to control 60 percent of a market.

From all the questions here, I count at least four cases in the Court's history where the Court has accepted a waiver by the Solicitor General and reached a tax issue. I have at least three cases, one of them just mentioned by Justice Kagan, where exceptions to that rule were read in.

For 10 months in 2005 and 2006, more than 36,000 nonmembers, or nearly 40 percent of those employees represented by SEIU employed by the State of California, were compelled to contribute to the SEIU's $12 million Political Fight-Back Fund without being provided the opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee, and to object to its exaction required by the First Amendment. Adding insult to that injury, the Ninth Circuit said that nonmembers could never say no to contributing to SEIU's political expenditures for ballot propositions, at least Proposition 76. They have no right to refuse to bankroll that element of SEIU's political speech. This defies this Court's decisions, distorting the political process on a massive scale.</text>",2011
