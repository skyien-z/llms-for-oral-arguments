St. Cyr is all about reliance.,"<speaker>Stephanos Bibas</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the government concedes, INA subsection 101(a)(13)(C)(v) added by IIRIRA does not expressly mandate retroactivity. Under Landgraf, applying that new provision would attach new legal consequences to pre-IIRIRA offenses, penalizing both those who travel and those who don't. Covered lawful permanent residents could not visit their parents abroad without being forced to abandon their children here. They would be removed from the country or else confined here. Either way, they would lose an ability they had under pre-IIRIRA law based on pre-IIRIRA offenses. Thus applying the subsection to them would be impermissibly retroactive. The settled expectations at issue here are those of round trips by lawful permanent residents, not, as the government would put it, one-way tickets or first-time entrants. These are people who have structured their lives here.

But in the prison context, as in any other, the traditional Miranda custody tests should apply and the question should be whether, in light of all of the circumstances, a reasonable person in the suspect's position would have felt free to terminate the interview and leave. That is so for three reasons. The first is that the Court reaffirmed in Maryland v. Shatzer that restraints on a suspect's freedom of movement are a necessary but not sufficient condition for Miranda custody. In other words, a reasonable suspect whose freedom of movement is restrained may nonetheless feel that he is free to terminate the questioning. Second, there are in fact many situations in which a reasonable inmate isolated for questioning would feel free to terminate the interrogation despite being subject to background prison restrictions. And third, the Sixth Circuit's per se rule here requires Miranda warnings to be given in situations in which the concerns about custodial interrogation that drove Miranda are simply not present. That holding impairs the important truth-seeking function of investigations by requiring the suppression of voluntary confessions made in noncustodial situations.</text>",2011

Alito, Jr.","It is your understanding that the -- that all of Boatner's, all the notes about Boatner's statements were turned over to the judge before trial for in camera inspection?","<speaker>Kannon K. Shanmugam</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Brady v. Maryland, this Court established the now-familiar principle that the prosecution must hand over all favorable material evidence to the defense before trial. This case presents a flagrant violation of that principle. The Orleans Parish district attorney's office produced almost no relevant evidence to the defense before Petitioner's trial, and Petitioner was convicted of first degree murder based solely on the testimony of a single eyewitness. Unbeknownst to the defense, however, that eyewitness had told the police on multiple occasions that he could not identify any of the perpetrators or, as he put it, that he would not know them if he saw them. The suppression of those statements alone justifies a new trial, but the district attorney's office in this case also engaged in the wholesale suppression of statements of numerous other witnesses, statements that further undermined the sole eyewitness identification of Petitioner and, more broadly, cast doubt on Petitioner's involvement and role in the shooting. If all of that information had been disclosed to the defense before trial, the jury surely would have viewed this case in a completely different light. The trial court therefore erred by rejecting Petitioner's Brady claim, and its judgment should be reversed. In our view, in order to conclude that Petitioner is entitled to a new trial here, this Court need do nothing more than to consider the suppressed statements of the key eyewitness, Larry Boatner. Respondent concedes that those statements were withheld from the defense before trial, and argues only that the failure to disclose those statements was not prejudicial. Those statements, however, could not have more clearly contradicted Boatner's confident identification of Petitioner at trial--</text>",2011

What I'm trying to get to is, what harm are we protecting here? I thought that the core of the First Amendment was to protect even against offensive speech. We have a legion of cases that said your emotional reaction to offensive speech is not enough. If that is the core of our First Amendment, what I hear, and that's what I think the court below said, is you can't really believe that a war veteran thinks less of the medal that he or she receives because someone's claiming fraudulently that they got one. They don't think less of the medal. We're reacting to the fact that we're offended by the thought that someone's claiming an honor they didn't receive.

The first strand that I have seen is that Congress can pass any necessary laws to effect those powers within its rights, i.e., because it made a decision that to effect, to effect mandatory issuance of insurance, that it could also obligate the mandatory purchase of it. The second strand I see is self-insurance affects the market, and so the government can regulate those who self-insure. And the third argument -- and I see all of them as different -- is that what the government is doing, and I think it's the argument you're making today -- that what the -- what the government is saying is if you pay for -- if you use health services, you have to pay with insurance. Because only insurance will guarantee that whatever need for health care that you have will be covered. Because virtually no one, perhaps with the exception of 1 percent of the population, can afford the massive cost if the unexpected happens. This third argument seems to be saying what we are regulating is health care, and when you go for health services, you have to pay for insurance, and since insurance won't issue at the moment that you consume the product, we can reasonably, necessarily tell you to buy it ahead of time, because you can't buy it at the moment that you need it.

They talk about whether the PTO has expertise, and presumptions that their fact findings based on their expertise have to be overcome with some convincing evidence. So they are talking in different language, but the concept they are talking about is one where the Court does accept findings of the PTO on the matters that involve their expertise, and give them weight -- substantial weight, essentially. And only overturn it if the Court is, in the words of Morgan and Radio City, ""thoroughly convinced"" that they were wrong. So what's wrong with that standard?

Those are two different concepts. And so that's what Microsoft said. Don't confuse burdens with standards of review. That it's de novo review is one thing, but even in de novo review we often give more weight or presumptive weight to some facts as opposed to others. And that's what I think Morgan was talking about. Morgan was very clear: Whether it was new evidence or not, you give -- you accept as valid whatever the PTO does, and you require to be thoroughly convinced by new evidence or not that they were wrong. I don't know why that standard can't apply in any situation. I think that's what Judge Newman intended, although he didn't say that.

I'm relying that the legislative history is replete with the commissioner of patents himself saying that section 145 required de novo review. And witness after witness tried to argue for Congress to change it, and it didn't, arguing that it required de novo review. Second, our cases repeatedly describe it as de novo review. So you got to get past that. And then you got to get past that between 1927 and 1945 you have Barrett on your side. But there are plenty of courts, including the Second Circuit, and a very respected jurist, Learned Hand, saying that if you exclude new evidence it should only be if it's on principles of estoppel, that someone intentionally withheld evidence from the PTO.

Exhibit A on that front is the fact that out of the 39 States or jurisdictions that allow this-- sentence, as Mr. Stevens has indicated -- or Mr. Stevenson has indicated, a good chunk of them, 27 in all, make the sentence the minimum sentence under the statute.

That's why some people are subject to the death penalty and others are not. And I do see a world of difference between the Miller killing and the Jackson killing, vis-a -- vis, the individual defendants' personal liability. So, assuming there are different kinds of -- of killings -- of murder, should we be looking at the Edmund/Tison line at all? Should we be talking about its application to juveniles in a different way?

The judge asked both sides' counsel for their position on Clair's complaint.
