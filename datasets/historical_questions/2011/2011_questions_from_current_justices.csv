This case arises from a Ninth Circuit decision that we submit does not apply the Court's standards, under circumstances where the officer submitted, far from a bare-bones affidavit, but a highly detailed, factual affidavit that we submit provided probable cause for the search or at least, under the Court's qualified immunity jurisprudence, a reasonable officer could believe that the warrant had probable cause.</text>",2011

They are policy choices and there are many factors that can be taken into account in drawing a map: How compact you want the districts to be, to what extent are you going to respect zones of economic interest, to what extent are you going to try to preserve old districts, what about incumbents, what about party registration? Are you going to try to have balance or are you going to try to favor one party or the other? That's all -- those are all questions of policy. And the question is who makes those policy decisions?

Interpretive services are potentially large, although you claim that they don't -- they have sort of a terminus point.

I was in the Southern District of New York. And fees there without translation, just for the oral courtroom work, sometimes went ahead for months. So potentiality's not the question. If you're talking about disproportionality, then that goes to the word ""reasonable"" in the statute, doesn't it? I mean, the Ortho case you point to, the court did sizably cut the translation fees. And more importantly, from the little I can tell, that was a huge patent case with a patent that was claimed to control 60 percent of a market.

I have at least three cases, one of them just mentioned by Justice Kagan, where exceptions to that rule were read in.

For 10 months in 2005 and 2006, more than 36,000 nonmembers, or nearly 40 percent of those employees represented by SEIU employed by the State of California, were compelled to contribute to the SEIU's $12 million Political Fight-Back Fund without being provided the opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee, and to object to its exaction required by the First Amendment. Adding insult to that injury, the Ninth Circuit said that nonmembers could never say no to contributing to SEIU's political expenditures for ballot propositions, at least Proposition 76. They have no right to refuse to bankroll that element of SEIU's political speech. This defies this Court's decisions, distorting the political process on a massive scale.</text>",2011

The -- the first question that it seems to me the Court should focus on is what policy is at issue here. And obviously, since the class certification deals with one set of issues and the plaintiff's claims deem with another set of issues, I think you have to be careful. I think you have to focus on the policies that existed in 2005. That was the basis on which he was in fact searched under these circumstances. And the policy in Burlington was that -- was primarily aimed, frankly, at health and tattoos, and the policy at Essex was aimed primarily at contraband and then secondarily at tattoos and health.

As Congress found and the Federal Government concedes, the community rating and guaranteed-issue provisions of the Act cannot stand without the individual mandate. Congress found that the individual mandate was essential to their operation. And not only can guaranteed-issue and community-rating not stand, not operate in the manner that Congress intended, they would actually counteract Congress's basic goal of providing patient protection but also affordable care.

Horwich</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I haven't heard any quarrel this morning with the proposition that if an animal goes down, say, as it's entering the abattoir to be slaughtered, that the State cannot at that point tell the slaughterhouse how it is to handle that animal. But that is not any different, of course, than the situation where a pig goes down as it's coming off the truck, or it presents as nonambulatory when the gates of the truck are open, because it's still an operational consideration; the same humane handling requirements still apply. It's still a State requirement and it's not -- it's still different from the Federal requirements. So the Court's questions this morning I think have gone to kind of the situations at the margins, at the extreme. So let me try to -- try to address some of those questions. The -- the question about whether -- the question about the purchase of the nonambulatory animal and the regulation, the regulation there, the first thing is, as a practical matter, I think you have to think about it in a concrete situation, which is that there is a nonambulatory animal that's on the slaughterhouse premises. That's the hypothetical that we are in. And the question is what is the slaughterhouse employee to do with that animal. And the State law says well, you can't buy it, you can't hold it, you can't receive it, you can't turn it into meat, and you have to immediately euthanize it.</text>",2011

24108,2011.10-224-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,I understood that the Federal regulation -- you can correct me if I'm misunderstanding -- is that if there is a suspect animal of any kind that it requires a slaughterhouse to wait until the Federal inspector comes and finds out whether it's just suspect or it's something that can't be sold. And the reason why the inspection occurs as I understand it is that there are some diseases that are so contagious that if the inspector decides that that animal is carrying that disease that the whole lot will be quarantined or otherwise destroyed.

But then you have to, you know, ask yourself the question: Are nonambulatory swine so easily excludable as horses. Why couldn't the State then exclude swine with various kinds of diseases?

And so I went back reading our cases, and Justice Story many, many years ago said, look, falsehoods have no value as such, but the ""breathing space"" concept is defined by those falsehoods which cause injury to rights that people possess, to -- to pecuniary interests that they have, or to the reputation of others. And almost every statute where we have approved a harm concept as being permissible for recovery has affected one of those three things. So please tell me what's wrong with Justice Story's view, number one; and, number two, how does the definition of harm fit in that? What's the harm here that fits within that descriptor.","<speaker>Donald B.

26563,2011.11-210-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"General, but I have a problem, which is it's not as narrow as it could get. Wouldn't take much to do exactly what Congress said it was doing, which was to protect against fraudulent claims of receiving a medal, and the example it used was someone who used a fraudulent claim of receiving a medal to get money. What I'm trying to get to is, what harm are we protecting here? I thought that the core of the First Amendment was to protect even against offensive speech. We have a legion of cases that said your emotional reaction to offensive speech is not enough. If that is the core of our First Amendment, what I hear, and that's what I think the court below said, is you can't really believe that a war veteran thinks less of the medal that he or she receives because someone's claiming fraudulently that they got one. They don't think less of the medal. We're reacting to the fact that we're offended by the thought that someone's claiming an honor they didn't receive. So outside of the emotional reaction, where's the harm? And I'm not minimizing it.

28839,2011.11-393-t02,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"General, I see or have seen three strands of arguments in your briefs, and one of them is echoed today. The first strand that I have seen is that Congress can pass any necessary laws to effect those powers within its rights, i.e., because it made a decision that to effect, to effect mandatory issuance of insurance, that it could also obligate the mandatory purchase of it. The second strand I see is self-insurance affects the market, and so the government can regulate those who self-insure. And the third argument -- and I see all of them as different -- is that what the government is doing, and I think it's the argument you're making today -- that what the -- what the government is saying is if you pay for -- if you use health services, you have to pay with insurance. Because only insurance will guarantee that whatever need for health care that you have will be covered. Because virtually no one, perhaps with the exception of 1 percent of the population, can afford the massive cost if the unexpected happens. This third argument seems to be saying what we are regulating is health care, and when you go for health services, you have to pay for insurance, and since insurance won't issue at the moment that you consume the product, we can reasonably, necessarily tell you to buy it ahead of time, because you can't buy it at the moment that you need it.

They talk about whether the PTO has expertise, and presumptions that their fact findings based on their expertise have to be overcome with some convincing evidence. So they are talking in different language, but the concept they are talking about is one where the Court does accept findings of the PTO on the matters that involve their expertise, and give them weight -- substantial weight, essentially. And only overturn it if the Court is, in the words of Morgan and Radio City, ""thoroughly convinced"" that they were wrong. So what's wrong with that standard? Everybody likes the deference language of today, but they were very clear in what they were saying: If the PTO made a finding, you decide whether that finding was based on its expertise, and if it was, you don't change it, court, unless you are thoroughly convinced they were wrong.

A worker injured on dry land from operations on dry land has a remedy in the State workers' compensation law, but not from OCSLA's extension of the Longshore Act to the outer continental shelf. Indeed, both the benefits review board and the Ninth Circuit here held that the accident occurred too far inland for direct coverage under the Longshore Act.</text>",2011

And I would like the point the Court to section 1333(c), which is on page 3(a) of the appendix to the government's brief. This is the provision involving the National Labor Relations Act. And I think this shows how Congress went about drafting when it wanted to specify legal consequences that would flow from an actual event that took place in a particular place. So Congress extends the National Labor Relations Act to any unfair labor practice as defined in such act occurring upon any artificial island. And it lists with particularity the particular situses where the National Labor Relations Act would apply. If Congress had followed that model in section 1333(b) it would be a very different statute. It would have said, as Your Honor pointed out, with respect to disability or death of an employee resulting from any injury on the outer continental shelf.

That's almost always a big part of the case. And once you get into that, you're going to get into questions of -- of religious doctrine. I just don't see it.

Now, there the university might argue, no, she's -- and did argue -- she's denied tenure because of the quality of her, of her scholarship. And okay, now, if you just try that pretext issue, the issue is going to be what is the real quality of her canon law scholarship?
