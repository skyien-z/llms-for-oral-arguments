Do you think there's could -- you increase the special nonresident tax beyond the lowest rate that the county tax is?,"<speaker>William F.

There is no reason that a State should have to subordinate this power, this taxing power, just because another State, exercising an equally legitimate taxing power, but on a very distinct ground, is taxing a portion of that income merely because it was earned within that State's borders.</text>",2014

The question is whether it can do both, whether -- and that's the question with respect to you. Can you tax all income earned within your border, whether by resident or by nonresident, and also tax income earned by your residents in -- in other States? The tax economists' brief points out that this -- what you've done operates exactly like a tariff, because it provides an incentive to earn income in Maryland and not outside of Maryland. Now, do you dispute that as a factual matter? And if you don't dispute it as a factual matter, why shouldn't this tax system meet exactly the same fate as a tariff?","<speaker>William F.

Isaacson</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The matter before the Court today concerns the scope and application of the Tax Injunction Act, a law passed by Congress in 1937 for the purpose of preventing State taxpayers from circumventing State-established and available procedures for challenging State tax assessments and instead, going directly to Federal court seeking to invoke the equity powers of Federal courts to enjoin the assessment and enforcement of State tax laws. The matter before the Court is one of statutory construction. In 2010, the State of Colorado passed legislation that had three components to it. It was directed at exclusively out-of-State retailers and required those retailers who made sales to Colorado residents and did not collect Colorado use tax to first provide a transaction notice in connection with each sale to a Colorado customer informing them of their obligation to self-report the use tax to the Colorado Department of Revenue; and then on an annual basis to send a mailing to Colorado customers informing them of all purchases that they made during the past year and, again, reiterating the requirement that they inform the Department of Revenue of their tax obligations; and third, for those out-of-State retailers affected by the law, to report to the Colorado Department of Revenue all of the customer transaction information that occurred during the past year for each Colorado customer. The case has an interesting procedural history which I think is of relevance both to the Tax Injunction Act and also to the issue of comity. The executive director did not raise the Tax Injunction Act at the district court level and did not challenge the jurisdiction of the district court. When the district court entered a permanent injunction enjoining enforcement of the Colorado statute and it was appealed by the executive director, the executive director, in her briefing to the Tenth Circuit, expressly informed the court that the Tax Injunction Act and comity did not apply and were not a bar to the Federal appellate court proceeding to hear the case.

You're saying that the HHS Exchange can't be for the State so that it's established by the choice of the State. The choice the State had was establish your own Exchange or let the Federal government establish it for you. That was the choice. If we read it the way you're saying, then we're going to read a statute as intruding on the Federal-State relationship, because then the States are going to be coerced into establishing their own Exchanges. And you say, oh, no, they can't be coerced, but let's go back to what Justice Breyer was talking about. In those States that don't -- their citizens don't receive subsidies, we're going to have the death spiral that this system was created to avoid. States are obligated, insurers are obligated to make sure that in their States, whether they're part of this program or not, that they have guaranteed coverage, that 26 -- that children are covered till they're 26, and that they base their costs on community ratings. So if they have to do that, then costs are going to rise on every insurance -- every insurance plan offered in the country in those 34 States, 3 or 6 of -- or 9 of your States will have tightened their Medicaid eligibility requirements in contravention of the Act, so they're taking money by breaking their compacts. They would have to lose all of their Medicaid money. Tell me how that is not coercive in an unconstitutional way?

Now, Mr. Carvin said there was factfinding about this. I'm afraid that's not correct. The -- the Petitioners -- the Petitioners did file a motion for summary judgment, but the case was decided on the basis of the government's motion to dismiss before discovery and without any factfinding.

Now, with respect to standing, the question -- the case or controversy question turns on whether any of the four Petitioners is liable for the tax penalty for 2014. Now, this case was litigated in -- in the district court in 2013 based on projections on the part of each of the four Petitioners that they would earn a certain income in 2014.

With respect to 2 of the 4, the projections were -- of their income were such that they would qualify for the unaffordability exception and they wouldn't have standing. With respect to the other 2, their projections were such that they wouldn't qualify for the unaffordability exception and they would have standing.

Now, Mr. Carvin said there was factfinding about this. I'm afraid that's not correct. The -- the Petitioners -- the Petitioners did file a motion for summary judgment, but the case was decided on the basis of the government's motion to dismiss before discovery and without any factfinding. I'm assuming because Mr. Carvin has not said anything about the absence of a tax penalty, that, at least, 1 of the 4 has and is, in fact, liable for a tax penalty, but that's the key standing question.

And I also think it's very important that I think there is a very good rational reason why Congress would have wanted to leave the comparison class issue open with respect to (b)(4) and not limit the comparison class in that arena to other commercial and industrial entities. And the reason is this: With respect to property taxes, I think Congress can rest assured that virtually all commercial and industrial entities are going to have real property and that if you're grouping the railroads with those entities and you're doing something unduly burdensome, those entities are going to speak up, they're going to use their political power, they're going to complain in some way.

And specifically with respect to diesel fuel, I think, and I'm just hypothesizing here, but it is very likely that there are many commercial and industrial taxpayers who either don't use diesel fuel at all or use very little diesel fuel in their businesses, such that a tax on diesel fuel that applies to them is a very small burden for them. And if you are going to count on the fact that they're going to speak up if there is a very burdensome diesel fuel tax that's laid on them and on railroads, I don't think that that holds true.

The second is the idea that 500 milligrams of this drug would likely kill a patient in 30 minutes or an hour, which seems to me irrelevant given that a lethal dose is completely consistent with unbearable pain. And the third is that that dose of midazolam would keep a patient unconscious while a needle is inserted into his thigh, which also seems irrelevant given the -- what everybody understands to be the much, much, much greater potential for pain of potassium chloride.
