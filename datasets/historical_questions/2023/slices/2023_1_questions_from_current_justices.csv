Adler</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The 922(g) offense is what triggers ACCA's penalties. The government, therefore, agrees that courts must apply ACCA's criteria in effect at the time of the 922(g) offense, not the prior conviction. For example, if Congress amended ACCA's criteria to delete burglary and someone then committed a 922(g) offense, all agree that a prior burglary conviction would not be an ACCA predicate, even if it was one at the time it occurred. The only question here then is whether ACCA's controlled substance criterion somehow warrants different treatment. And it does not. That criterion expressly incorporates the substances on the federal schedules. Under basic rules of statutory construction, that means the substances are effectively written into ACCA itself. So where a substance is removed from the schedules before the 922(g) offense, it is also removed from ACCA's coverage, no less than burglary in the hypothetical.

So it's not really about his willingness to -- to commit a crime. I mean, he has these criminal offenses. Congress would have just said, do you have an offense? Instead, they say, do you have a serious drug offense? And what I am struggling with and trying to get beyond is why we are evaluating the seriousness of that offense based on past standards as opposed to the standards that would apply today as we're making this 15-year determination.","<speaker>Jeffrey T.

So part of the dynamic that I think is going on in these cases is the fact that this regulation is enacted by the sort of democratically elected representatives of a state. And I suppose that if the state's regulation of these platforms gets too burdensome, then presumably the platforms can say forget it, we're not going to operate in your state. And then the citizens of the state would have the chance to determine if that's what they really wanted. That's sort of how I'm looking at this at a  --at a meta level. So what caught my attention was your response to the Chief Justice when you suggested that your client couldn't withdraw from the state of Texas because you read the provision related to censorship and geography as ensuring that you don't do so. I had not read that provision in that way. So can you say more about why that's your interpretation?","<speaker>Paul D.

I think the right thing to do with that intuition is to recognize that it's not like you can just exempt them from the First Amendment.

Frederick</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  This case involves a classic 10b- 5(b) misleading half- truth. Petitioners disclosed a few known trends that would affect their bottom line but omitted the IMO 2020 uncertainty that would decimate 40 percent of their revenue. Just as disclosing two roads near a property when a third one actually bisects it is a classic fraudulent half- truth, so is a partial Item 303 disclosure that omits required material information. A reasonable investor would expect the description of known trends to be complete and would be misled by such a material omission. If accepted, Petitioners' argument would create a roadmap for fraud. Petitioners knew they were about to lose a substantial part of their business but kept their  stock price artificially inflated by deliberately  withholding information about their readiness to comply with an important rule change.

Now Petitioners concede that an omission can be a half- truth when there is a statement on the same subject. But Item 303 defines the relevant subject, any known trends or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to significantly affect revenues or income. So, if a company, as, Mr. Chief Justice, your hypothetical pointed out, discloses that sales are going to go up by some customers, but suppose that the supplier of parts is about to go into bankruptcy, both of those statements go to the same subject under Item 303.

12377,2023.22-1165-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas," If pure omissions are misleading -- it seems as though you're saying the mere fact that it is an omission makes it misleading. Can you  --is there a limit to that?  MR. FREDERIC K:  Yes, there is, Justice Thomas. And what the Second Circuit did below was it went through, essentially, a decision tree whether there was a violation of Item 303. It asked first, is there a known trend?  Would it reasonably affect the bottom line?  If the  answer to that is no, then any omission that would not concern a known trend wouldn't be required for disclosure. And if there was an  uncertainty about that, then the managers are asked whether or not disclosing that event would  be reasonably likely to occur, which is a lower standard still. The Second Circuit provided those kind of prophylactic protections through the decision tree that it undertook to determine whether or not an omission in these particular contexts would be important, and it determined  -- and this isn't challenged on appeal  --that it was objectively unreasonable for the company not to put in their Item 303 disclosure the facts that would be necessary to determine the company's readiness to deal with the IMO 2020  rule change, which is going to decimate the 6 oil market. And so, for that reason, it seems very clear to us that when the managers are assessing what needs to be in the Item 303 disclosure, omitting something that would be so material, as was the case here, would be independently actionable. And I would point out that the underlying Second Circuit case that's really on appeal here is called Stratte- McClure. That was the precedent on which the per curiam panel below relied. Stratte- McClure said that omissions that were of such materiality would lead the financial statements to be misleading. We think what it meant by that was the MD&A part. And the comment is made, well, the MD&A is many pages. Well, the statement in a Supreme Court brief can be many, many pages.

Coberly</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Like many cases, this case should be resolved by the text, and, here, the text is in Rule 10b- 5 as adopted by the Congress in the PSLRA. That text makes clear that an omission is actionable in just one circumstance, when the omitted fact is material and necessary to make a statement not misleading. Today, you're going to hear arguments for omission liability in a different circumstance, when the omitted fact is material and required to be stated by Item 303. None of those arguments is rooted in the text. The text doesn't permit eliding the statement requirement by treating the entire management narrative as misleading if one thing is left out. The PSLRA shows that Congress had something far more specific in mind by the word ""statement.""  The text also doesn't permit recasting a claim about what a 10- K does or doesn't say as a claim involving a fraudulent scheme or act. Whenever this Court has recognized liability under Rule 10b -5(a) or (c), the case has involved something more or different than speech alone. And this is all in the context of the judicially implied private right of action, which this Court is loath to expand. No circuit, either before or after the PSLRA, has approached 10b -5 liability in the ways that Moab and the government are seeking here. Now, to be  clear, no one is seeking immunity. The SEC has extensive powers to penalize an omission that violates Item 303. But, without the element of a misleading statement, an omission can't be the subject of a private class action.

12422,2023.22-585-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas,"Before we get to the choice between Barker and Mathews, isn't there the -- an antecedent question as to whether or not there's any constitutional requirement for additional hearings in the context of forfeiture?","<speaker>Shay Dvoretzky</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question presented is narrow: Should courts apply Mathews or Barker to assess the sufficiency of process in civil forfeiture proceedings? The answer is Mathews. Mathews is the default due process standard for civil cases and for good reason. It assesses both the private and governmental interests to guard against unreasonable risks of error. And the Court has consistently applied it to determine whether more process is due, including in Good, another civil forfeiture case. Respondents prefer Barker because Barker's answer is always no additional process. But Respondents' primary argument is just that $8,850 and Von Neumann already decided the question, not that Barker makes sense and Mathews doesn't. Respondents are wrong. As the Second and Sixth Circuits have explained in adopting Mathews over Barker, $8,850 and Von Neumann concern the length of time for a final disposition rather than the need for an interim hearing. The litigants in $8,850 and Von Neumann also were not claiming innocence, so they were not seeking and the Court did not address retention hearings.

We know there are abuses of the forfeiture system. We know it because it's been documented throughout the country repeatedly of the incentives that police are given to seize property to keep its value as opposed to issues of probable cause or issues of legitimacy of the seizure, okay? We also know that that incentive has often led to months, if not years, of retention of property that ultimately gets returned to the owner because there was either no probable cause or because of the innocent owner defense. So the question before us is, if we make a determination to take the dicta in Von Neumann and in the 8-8 whatever case, all right, to say that's the entire process you're ever due, do we leave open the possibility that there are states, jurisdictions that are abusing this process and not leaving us any arms to correct it? That's what we're doing, isn't it? If we say there's no overriding first question, is this process, the features of this process, are they enough, whether it's under Mathews or Barker, then what we're basically saying is go at it, states, take as much property as you want, keep it as long as you want, let's hold out no hope whatsoever that there's ever going to be any further process that's due?

But Respondents' primary argument is just that $8,850 and Von Neumann already decided the question, not that Barker makes sense and Mathews doesn't. Respondents are wrong. As the Second and Sixth Circuits have explained in adopting Mathews over Barker, $8,850 and Von Neumann concern the length of time for a final disposition rather than the need for an interim hearing. The litigants in $8,850 and Von Neumann also were not claiming innocence, so they were not seeking and the Court did not address retention hearings. Only Mathews can answer the sufficiency-of-process question. The courts of appeals and state supreme courts that have addressed the question presented have overwhelmingly chosen Mathews over Barker. Although the Court need not go beyond the methodological question presented and apply the Mathews factors, the point of Mathews is to -- is to ensure that laws adequately protect the Constitution's fundamental due process guarantee, taking into account the private and governmental interests at stake. It's not to micromanage state legislatures. The easiest way for a jurisdiction to ensure its laws comport with due process, as the Second and Sixth Circuits have explained, is generally to offer a reasonably prompt post-seizure hearing to allow claimants to raise an innocent owner argument. Indeed, numerous states have done just that, and their experience makes clear, contrary to Respondents' contentions, that retention hearings are workable and effective.

12467,2023.22-585-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"All right. Let me finally just ask you about, again, the timing and whether -- you know, I think there is something to this notion that Barker is about timing, but, again, the question remains, isn't the claimant in this case making a timing kind of argument? And I guess I see that, but can you help me with the following hypo, and then maybe I'll also get the reaction on the other side. So, if we have a scenario in which everyone agrees that the average time for a forfeiture proceeding is, say, six months after the seizure, and everybody agrees that that is reasonable for due process purposes, Plaintiff Number 1 doesn't receive her forfeiture hearing until 12 months after the seizure, so her claim is that the government was too slow in giving her the hearing. Meanwhile, Plaintiff Number 2 receives her hearing in six months, but she claims that at some point within those six months there should be an opportunity for the court to consider whether she should have been allowed to keep her car during that interim period. She's not complaining about the time. Six months is fine. She got her hearing within the six months. But what she's saying is, while you figure out during that six months who owns this car, I should keep custody of it during that period, and I think we should have that adjudicated separately from the forfeiture hearing. Are those two different things, or are they both really about timing?","<speaker>Shay Dvoretzky</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question presented is narrow: Should courts apply Mathews or Barker to assess the sufficiency of process in civil forfeiture proceedings? The answer is Mathews. Mathews is the default due process standard for civil cases and for good reason. It assesses both the private and governmental interests to guard against unreasonable risks of error. And the Court has consistently applied it to determine whether more process is due, including in Good, another civil forfeiture case.

That's why people want this retention hearing, because it takes too long, even under Barker, to have the final adjudication. I want it back more quickly. Totally right. But we, in fact, have not decided this precise question. We have a couple of sentences which were written broadly and, if taken literally, would -- would answer the case. But, in fact, the two cases that we had were about different kind of procedures at a different time in the process. And so we could say that even though this -- there are similarities here, this remains open to us to decide whether there ought to be, in addition to the Barker -- the Barker limited final adjudication, this -- this kind of retention hearing that -- that applies to the interim period.

First of all, I doubt very much that criminal defendants from whom cars have been taken are going to seek a retention hearing because whatever they say will be used against them in the criminal case. I don't think New York's experience reflects the use of these retention hearing by criminals or by people from whom the goods have been taken that are tied to criminal activity. These cases are most important for one group of people, innocent owners, because they are people who claim they didn't know about the criminal activity. Many of these cases involve parents with young -- with teenage or close-to-teenage children involved in drug activity. The ones that don't may involve spouses or friends. And I assume, in many of these hearings, to the extent that a person is involved in drug dealing, that the government pretty quickly will find out or not find out if that person has a relationship to a home or other place where drugs are being stored, distributed, et cetera, and the government can do what your opposing counsel said, ex parte hearing saying this is a wife who claims she's an innocent owner, but we have evidence that there's drug dealing going on from the home, it's unlikely she's an innocent owner. If it's someone who's unrelated and no continuing relationship, et cetera. So you're talking about criminals get -- keeping these cars. But, given that the vast majority -- I -- I believe the statistic was very high -- certainly, over 60 percent of innocent owners win, it is not criminals keeping cars.

So the state has a system -- this is a hypothetical I'm making up on the spot. The state has a system in which the manner of proving that the person, you know, knows about the drugs is very unfair. You know, the state says we presume that if you are -- you know, know this individual, then you're aware of their drug activity. And since this person is your son, you obviously know them. You can't bring in any evidence that shows that you didn't know anything about it. You're not an innocent owner under that test.

And the Court has consistently applied it to determine whether more process is due, including in Good, another civil forfeiture case. Respondents prefer Barker because Barker's answer is always no additional process. But Respondents' primary argument is just that $8,850 and Von Neumann already decided the question, not that Barker makes sense and Mathews doesn't. Respondents are wrong.

Justice Jackson?","<speaker>Shay Dvoretzky</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question presented is narrow: Should courts apply Mathews or Barker to assess the sufficiency of process in civil forfeiture proceedings? The answer is Mathews. Mathews is the default due process standard for civil cases and for good reason. It assesses both the private and governmental interests to guard against unreasonable risks of error. And the Court has consistently applied it to determine whether more process is due, including in Good, another civil forfeiture case. Respondents prefer Barker because Barker's answer is always no additional process. But Respondents' primary argument is just that $8,850 and Von Neumann already decided the question, not that Barker makes sense and Mathews doesn't. Respondents are wrong. As the Second and Sixth Circuits have explained in adopting Mathews over Barker, $8,850 and Von Neumann concern the length of time for a final disposition rather than the need for an interim hearing. The litigants in $8,850 and Von Neumann also were not claiming innocence, so they were not seeking and the Court did not address retention hearings. Only Mathews can answer the sufficiency-of-process question. The courts of appeals and state supreme courts that have addressed the question presented have overwhelmingly chosen Mathews over Barker. Although the Court need not go beyond the methodological question presented and apply the Mathews factors, the point of Mathews is to -- is to ensure that laws adequately protect the Constitution's fundamental due process guarantee, taking into account the private and governmental interests at stake. It's not to micromanage state legislatures. The easiest way for a jurisdiction to ensure its laws comport with due process, as the Second and Sixth Circuits have explained, is generally to offer a reasonably prompt post-seizure hearing to allow claimants to raise an innocent owner argument. Indeed, numerous states have done just that, and their experience makes clear, contrary to Respondents' contentions, that retention hearings are workable and effective.

You -- you say that you think that the only right is to a timely final forfeiture hearing, but I thought what was at issue in this case is the test that is to be used to make that determination.

But I thought this -- that the -- I thought we had tests that we applied in the law to lead us to that conclusion in particular cases depending upon the claims and the circumstances. And so our question was what test? And am I wrong? It -- it -- it feels to me strangely like the government has picked the answer and is choosing the test that will inevitably lead to the answer that the government wants, as opposed to telling us here is the difference between the Barker test and the Mathews test and which one is better in terms -- more consistent with our prior case law, et cetera, et cetera?","<speaker>Shay Dvoretzky</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question presented is narrow: Should courts apply Mathews or Barker to assess the sufficiency of process in civil forfeiture proceedings?

Prelogar</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Guns and domestic abuse are a deadly combination. As this Court has said, all too often, the only difference between a battered woman and a dead woman is the presence of a gun. Armed abusers also pose grave danger to police officers responding to domestic violence calls and to the public at large, as Zackey Rahimi's own conduct shows. To address that acute threat, Congress and 48 states and territories temporarily disarm individuals subject to domestic violence protective orders. Congress designed Section 922(g)(8) to target the most dangerous domestic abusers. It applies only if, after notice and a hearing, a court makes an express finding that the person poses a credible threat to an intimate partner's physical safety or imposes a specific prohibition on the use of physical force, and the disarmament lasts only as long as the order remains in effect. The Fifth Circuit profoundly erred in reading this Court's decision in Bruen to prohibit that widespread common-sense response to the deadly threat of armed domestic violence. Like Heller and McDonald, Bruen recognized that Congress may disarm those who are not law-abiding, responsible citizens. That principle is firmly grounded in the Second Amendment's history and tradition. Throughout our nation's history, legislatures have disarmed those who have committed serious criminal conduct or whose access to guns poses a danger, for example, loyalists, rebels, minors, individuals with mental illness, felons, and drug addicts. Rahimi offers no historical evidence that those laws were thought to violate the right to keep and bear arms or that the Second Amendment was originally understood to prevent legislatures from disarming dangerous individuals. Despite all that, the Fifth Circuit held that Section 922(g)(8) is facially unconstitutional because the founding generation didn't disarm domestic abusers in particular.

Armed abusers also pose grave danger to police officers responding to domestic violence calls and to the public at large, as Zackey Rahimi's own conduct shows. To address that acute threat, Congress and 48 states and territories temporarily disarm individuals subject to domestic violence protective orders. Congress designed Section 922(g)(8) to target the most dangerous domestic abusers. It applies only if, after notice and a hearing, a court makes an express finding that the person poses a credible threat to an intimate partner's physical safety or imposes a specific prohibition on the use of physical force, and the disarmament lasts only as long as the order remains in effect. The Fifth Circuit profoundly erred in reading this Court's decision in Bruen to prohibit that widespread common-sense response to the deadly threat of armed domestic violence. Like Heller and McDonald, Bruen recognized that Congress may disarm those who are not law-abiding, responsible citizens. That principle is firmly grounded in the Second Amendment's history and tradition. Throughout our nation's history, legislatures have disarmed those who have committed serious criminal conduct or whose access to guns poses a danger, for example, loyalists, rebels, minors, individuals with mental illness, felons, and drug addicts. Rahimi offers no historical evidence that those laws were thought to violate the right to keep and bear arms or that the Second Amendment was originally understood to prevent legislatures from disarming dangerous individuals. Despite all that, the Fifth Circuit held that Section 922(g)(8) is facially unconstitutional because the founding generation didn't disarm domestic abusers in particular.

Armed abusers also pose grave danger to police officers responding to domestic violence calls and to the public at large, as Zackey Rahimi's own conduct shows. To address that acute threat, Congress and 48 states and territories temporarily disarm individuals subject to domestic violence protective orders. Congress designed Section 922(g)(8) to target the most dangerous domestic abusers. It applies only if, after notice and a hearing, a court makes an express finding that the person poses a credible threat to an intimate partner's physical safety or imposes a specific prohibition on the use of physical force, and the disarmament lasts only as long as the order remains in effect. The Fifth Circuit profoundly erred in reading this Court's decision in Bruen to prohibit that widespread common-sense response to the deadly threat of armed domestic violence. Like Heller and McDonald, Bruen recognized that Congress may disarm those who are not law-abiding, responsible citizens. That principle is firmly grounded in the Second Amendment's history and tradition. Throughout our nation's history, legislatures have disarmed those who have committed serious criminal conduct or whose access to guns poses a danger, for example, loyalists, rebels, minors, individuals with mental illness, felons, and drug addicts. Rahimi offers no historical evidence that those laws were thought to violate the right to keep and bear arms or that the Second Amendment was originally understood to prevent legislatures from disarming dangerous individuals. Despite all that, the Fifth Circuit held that Section 922(g)(8) is facially unconstitutional because the founding generation didn't disarm domestic abusers in particular. But Bruen specifically approved that kind of demand for a historical twin.

Throughout our nation's history, legislatures have disarmed those who have committed serious criminal conduct or whose access to guns poses a danger, for example, loyalists, rebels, minors, individuals with mental illness, felons, and drug addicts. Rahimi offers no historical evidence that those laws were thought to violate the right to keep and bear arms or that the Second Amendment was originally understood to prevent legislatures from disarming dangerous individuals.

I guess I understood our use of that phrase in our prior cases to describe the would-be gun owners in those cases. Like, we're not talking about who might be able to be disarmed. There might be other people. But all of those people were law-abiding and responsible, and there was no allegation that they weren't. But it seems to me that in your brief and in parts of the argument the government is asking for that to be a test. But I don't think we presented it as a test.

That means loyalist laws are entirely off the analogical spectrum here because loyalists were also pervasively deprived of all of the rights of the people and citizenship. They were enemies. The government said so in its Bruen amicus brief. In response to Justice Gorsuch's question about how the courts of appeals handle the issue of self-defense, necessity, duress, we cite a case on page 11 of our brief, United States versus Penn, I remember that case very well, it will show you how they handle it. There's effectively not one. I mean, even brief fleeting possession that lasts a little bit longer while being chased by people, not enough. So there is no real keeping for self-defense exception to this principle. And in regards to I think it was Justice Alito's question of duration of protective orders, by default, they can be permanent in Alabama, Colorado, Montana, Washington. No specific limit in Florida, Michigan, North Dakota, Vermont. Ten years in Arkansas, five years in California, Ohio, South Dakota. And in Texas, where the default is two years, if the judge finds or a finding is made that felony violence was committed, it can be five years and the time is tolled, for instance, when someone's in jail.

There's effectively not one. I mean, even brief fleeting possession that lasts a little bit longer while being chased by people, not enough. So there is no real keeping for self-defense exception to this principle. And in regards to I think it was Justice Alito's question of duration of protective orders, by default, they can be permanent in Alabama, Colorado, Montana, Washington. No specific limit in Florida, Michigan, North Dakota, Vermont. Ten years in Arkansas, five years in California, Ohio, South Dakota. And in Texas, where the default is two years, if the judge finds or a finding is made that felony violence was committed, it can be five years and the time is tolled, for instance, when someone's in jail. And so, while it may be the case that if we counted noses, exactly 51 or 52 are around a year or so, it is not the case that they are short. Now the danger with any kind of historical inquiry is like the person looking down a well. So it feels like what the government is doing is looking down the dark well of American history and seeing only a reflection of itself in the 20th and 21st Century and saying that's what history shows. When Congress enacted Section 922(g)(8) in 1994, it acted without the benefit of Heller, McDonald, and Bruen, so we shouldn't be surprised that they missed the mark.

Despite this delegation clause, the parties have spent nearly three years disputing this threshold issue. That's because, instead of enforcing the delegation clause, the courts below came up with rationales to evade it and to instead answer the question of arbitrability for themselves.

Respondents do not defend that reasoning. They agree the contracts here were formed and that they were in effect. Their argument is that the scope of the otherwise applicable arbitration agreement was narrowed  by a later contract to exclude their asserted claims.

I don't know whether the silence or not is relevant. The question is what does state law do. We didn't answer  --we didn't ask for briefing on that. The short answer is the court decides what state law says or doesn't say.

Respondents and Coinbase agreed to arbitrate any disputes about Coinbase services and to delegate to an arbitrator any threshold disputes about whether specific claims were subject to arbitration. Despite this delegation clause, the parties have spent nearly three years disputing this threshold issue. That's because, instead of enforcing the delegation clause, the courts below came up with rationales to evade it and to instead answer the question of arbitrability for themselves. The Ninth Circuit did so by characterizing Respondents' challenge as one of contract formation, asserting that contract formation can never be delegated and sidestepping the delegation clause. The issue,  as the court of appeals saw it, was whether the parties formed a contract to arbitrate these claims. If that approach were correct, courts in every case could ignore delegation clauses by just characterizing an arbitrability dispute as a question of whether the parties formed a contract to arbitrate the claims at issue. Respondents do not defend that reasoning. They agree the contracts here were formed and that they were in effect. Their argument is that the scope of the otherwise applicable arbitration agreement was narrowed  by a later contract to exclude their asserted claims. That question is one of arbitrability, and the parties agreed an arbitrator would decide it. Respondents blur three distinct legal questions in a case like this one. The first is the merits of the claims the Respondents assert. The second is whether those  -- the merits of those claims should be arbitrated.

And I guess my question for you is the inverse of the one I asked your friend on the other side.

And if it were in one contract, there's no doubt that the arbitrator would decide which  -- which direction to route things, right?  The only question is does the second contract make this different than it being in a single contract. And I struggle to see why that would be the case. And I furthermore struggle to see why you would care because your real argument is that the agreement is to litigate this in court. And the routing, who's going to do the routing?

So I understand in Nieves that that may not have been relevant, in part because it was a warrantless arrest, so there was no process involved, and also in part because, frankly, Mr. Nieves's complaint didn't allege an ulterior motive that might satisfy an abuse of process claim, right?  It didn't -- it didn't have an allegation that he was being extorted in the way that we have that kind of allegation here.

13851,2023.22-1025-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," That's -- that's -- that's an obvious implication of -- I mean not just an implication. Nieves makes that quite clear. Now, on the other side of the spectrum, you have this quite obviously  comparative evidence. The Fifth Circuit seemed to have a very narrow view of what that was, like you have to point to a particular person who wasn't arrested. But let's expand that a little bit more and say, well, that would be a little bit nutty. I mean, if you come in and you say nobody's ever been arrested for that, I can't point to a particular person, but, look, nobody's ever been arrested for that, that should count too, right?  So -- so -- so, you know, that's all, like, very comparative stuff, right?  So in the middle -- and I guess this is where I thought your brief was interesting -- is objective evidence that you might take to support an inference as to comparisons with other people but that is not on its face very comparative in nature. And I'll just read you some of what you said in your brief. The timing of and events leading up to a plaintiff's arrest, the history of the defendant's interactions with the plaintiffs, the fact that officers falsely documented the arrest. Maybe the most  comparative of these is the employment of an unusual, irregular, or unnecessarily onerous arrest procedure. So all of these, you can understand how somebody could argue from them to a comparative statement that another person who didn't make these kinds  -- who didn't engage in this kind of speech activity wouldn't have been treated the same way, but it is a little bit of an inferential jump. And so I guess my long-winded question is, why do you put those sorts of statements in the bucket that should be able to come in to get past the probable cause bar rather than lump them with allegations of subjective intent on the part of the police officer?","<speaker>Nicole F.

But then you seem to accept numbers or different kinds of forms of evidence that don't in my view necessarily go directly to determining that a similarly situated person was treated differently. So how --I guess Justice Kagan put it that there are sort of several inferences to get you from certain kinds of evidence to a similarly situated person.

Second, the control test ignores Section 25b's express codification of Barnett  Bank's ""prevents or significantly interferes with"" standard and, in particular, the word  ""significantly,"" which Bank of America reads out of the statute. Third, a control test can't be squared with  Section 25b's provisions for OCC preemption determinations, which must assess the impact of a state law and be based on substantial evidence.

Finally and perhaps most fundamentally, adopting a control test would require reading virtually all of Section 25b to have no real-world effect.

Third, a control test can't be squared with  Section 25b's provisions for OCC preemption determinations, which must assess the impact of a state law and be based on substantial evidence. These requirements would make no sense if a control test were the law. Finally and perhaps most fundamentally, adopting a control test would require reading virtually all of Section 25b to have no real-world effect.

14329,2023.22-529-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan," Mr. Stewart, it might be that you have text on your side, but before we get to that question, I guess I'm interested in many of the inquiries that Justice Alito was making, and I'll just come at it a slightly different way. Yes, significance tests are common in the law, but they're not really common in preemption inquiries. We don't really see a whole lot of  preemption inquiries where we have to do this question of, like, how much is too much. And, you know, one reason we don't is you  -- you need an answer that applies everywhere and for all time. I  --I mean, significant effects, you could have no significant effect now and then 10 years from now, you're in a different economic environment and you could have a significant effect. And does that mean it would be a kind of on/off switch like one day the law applies and the next day, 10 years later, it doesn't?  So add to Justice Alito's question about maybe different parties would present  different records, maybe different states would have the exact same law, but the economic circumstances in those two states would be very different, so it looks as though the federal law preempts one state law and doesn't preempt the other state law.

He's not on the list. He hasn't been on the list in eight years. And he won't be put back on the list in the future based on the currently available information. That makes it absolutely clear that his return to the list for the same reasons he was put on it initially can't reasonably be expected to recur. Now the Ninth Circuit thought the claims weren't moot because the government hadn't acquiesced to the righteousness of his contentions. That fundamentally confuses mootness with the merits. As this Court has explained, a case can be moot no matter how vehemently the parties dispute the conduct that gave rise to the lawsuit. Respondent's new test isn't much better because it too can be satisfied solely by repudiation of the past conduct.

15384,2023.22-1178-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"All right. So I understand here that what we're really talking about is the extent to which the government can rely on voluntary cessation to claim that he no longer has a -- a claim. And I think that's slightly different than an analysis of whether or not he would have had standing to bring this in, you know, under these circumstances if -- if for no other reason than the standing sort of analysis is on him, right? I mean, it's his burden to show that he was injured, et cetera, et cetera. Here, he's brought a claim. The government, I -- I didn't take you to be saying that there's something wrong with his claim in its inception, but the government is now arguing that the claim is no longer live because of mootness because they have removed him from the list. And our standard for that is the Laidlaw, you know, standard that we're talking about. And so I guess I'm, keeping all of that framework in mind, wanting to understand why the government's argument about, well, this is on the totality of the circumstances and he could possibly be put back on the list, why haven't you just talked yourself out of the standard? I mean, you -- you -- you just in response to my colleagues suggested that he could be put back on the list if he started giving money to this organization again. So that sounds like you lose under the Laidlaw standard, doesn't it?","<speaker>Sopan Joshi</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent's No Fly List claims are moot. He's not on the list. He hasn't been on the list in eight years. And he won't be put back on the list in the future based on the currently available information. That makes it absolutely clear that his return to the list for the same reasons he was put on it initially can't reasonably be expected to recur. Now the Ninth Circuit thought the claims weren't moot because the government hadn't acquiesced to the righteousness of his contentions. That fundamentally confuses mootness with the merits. As this Court has explained, a case can be moot no matter how vehemently the parties dispute the conduct that gave rise to the lawsuit. Respondent's new test isn't much better because it too can be satisfied solely by repudiation of the past conduct. And that persistent focus on repudiation and the past I think lays bare what's really going on in this case. The complaint isn't really concerned about Respondent's potentially being put back on the No Fly List in the future. What Respondent wants is vindication for his past placement.

But the Courtright declaration just promises Mr. Fikre that he won't be put back on the No Fly List based on currently available information. That's in -- inadequate for three reasons. First, if our client was previously listed for attending the wrong mosque and attends that same mosque this year, the declaration would allow the government to relist him. It gets worse. Even if he doesn't attend again, but the government gets new suspicion-inducing information not about Yonas but about the mosque itself, the -- the declaration likewise allows the government to relist. Any new fact not currently known to the government would allow Yonas to be relisted, consistent with the declaration. And if he is relisted in either of those ways, that's recurrence of the challenged conduct. He is disadvantaged in the same fundamental way his complaint was meant to redress. Imagine if Nike had promised Already not to bring any trademark claim based on currently available information but could sue for infringement based on new information. Under those facts, the Court couldn't have concluded that Already could move on with its business free from suit. Second, the Courtright declaration does nothing to guarantee Fikre notice or a hearing if he is relisted and, therefore, does not address his procedural due process claim at all. The government's response is that he has no current plans to relist him, but the government insists on retaining the right to do so. And that's its prerogative, but if it does relist him, there is a hundred percent certainty that his procedural claim will recur. Third, because the government hasn't disclosed either to Yonas or a court why he is listed -- why he was listed, a court can't possibly say anything clearly at all about whether recurrence is reasonably likely or not, and Mr. Fikre cannot move on with his life in the way the lawsuit was meant to allow. He doesn't know why he was listed. He doesn't know what might cause him to be relisted.

First, if our client was previously listed for attending the wrong mosque and attends that same mosque this year, the declaration would allow the government to relist him. It gets worse.

Any new fact not currently known to the government would allow Yonas to be relisted, consistent with the declaration. And if he is relisted in either of those ways, that's recurrence of the challenged conduct. He is disadvantaged in the same fundamental way his complaint was meant to redress. Imagine if Nike had promised Already not to bring any trademark claim based on currently available information but could sue for infringement based on new information. Under those facts, the Court couldn't have concluded that Already could move on with its business free from suit. Second, the Courtright declaration does nothing to guarantee Fikre notice or a hearing if he is relisted and, therefore, does not address his procedural due process claim at all.

""Income"" was understood at the time of the Sixteenth Amendment's adoption to refer to gains coming into the taxpayer, like wages, rents, and dividends. Appreciation in the value of a home, a stock investment, or other property is not and never has been taxed as income. The reason is that a gain is not income unless and until it has been realized by the taxpayer. The Court squarely held as much in Eisner versus Macomber just a few years following adoption of the amendment, and the Court's decisions have held that line for a century. That precedent makes easy work of this case. It is undisputed that the Petitioners realized nothing from their stock investment. They were taxed not because they had any income but because, in 2017, they happened to own shares in a corporation carrying retained earnings on its books. This is a tax on the ownership of property. It therefore must be apportioned. Dispensing with the need for realization sweeps away what the Framers regarded as the essential check on Congress's power to tax property. The government cannot identify a single thing that Congress couldn't tax as income under its position that realization is unnecessary. Without realization, there is no limiting principle. Accepting the government's position on income would make a hash of the current law. The Tax Code's gateway definition of ""gross income"" exerts the full measure of Congress's taxing power under the Sixteenth Amendment by reaching all income from whatever source derived. If the government's position in this case is right, then current law already requires taxpayers to report and pay tax on appreciation in the value of all their assets, on corporate earnings for any stocks that they own, and on any paper gains from their contracts and loans. That's not how the income tax has ever worked going back to 1913. Again, the reason the law doesn't work that way is the obvious one. Unrealized gains are not income.

Several of those taxes were like the MRT in that they taxed shareholders on undistributed corporate earnings, including the income taxes in 1864, 1865, 1867, and 1870. And this Court upheld Congress's power to impose those taxes in Hubbard. The Sixteenth Amendment's drafters, therefore, would have understood taxes on incomes to include taxes like the MRT. That's confirmed by the very first income tax Congress enacted under the Sixteenth Amendment. That 1913 law taxed certain shareholders on their pro rata shares of undistributed corporate earnings.

Prelogar</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The MRT is firmly grounded in the Sixteenth Amendment's text and history. The amendment allows Congress to impose taxes on incomes. That phrase had a well-established meaning drawn from numerous preratification income taxes that Congress enacted before this Court's decision in Pollock. Several of those taxes were like the MRT in that they taxed shareholders on undistributed corporate earnings, including the income taxes in 1864, 1865, 1867, and 1870. And this Court upheld Congress's power to impose those taxes in Hubbard. The Sixteenth Amendment's drafters, therefore, would have understood taxes on incomes to include taxes like the MRT. That's confirmed by the very first income tax Congress enacted under the Sixteenth Amendment. That 1913 law taxed certain shareholders on their pro rata shares of undistributed corporate earnings. And the trend of pass-through taxation has continued throughout the next century from taxes on partners to S Corporation shareholders, to foreign corporation shareholders under Subpart F. Against all that history, Petitioners stake their case on Macomber. But the Court has limited Macomber to taxes on particular stock dividends that are not at issue here. If the Court now extended Macomber's discussion to invalidate all taxes on undistributed business earnings, it would cause a sea change in the operation of the Tax Code and cost several trillions of dollars in lost tax revenue. Petitioners say that every other provision of the Tax Code could be saved under a theory of constructive realization, but they don't provide a comprehensive definition of that term or explain why it would rescue every provision except the MRT. My friend today said it's a blanket term that's defined by the circumstances where you can say that constructive realization occurred. But that's simply circular. And by conceding constructive realization, they've acknowledged Congress's power to draw reasonable lines about what counts as income and who can be taxed on it, which is exactly what Congress did in the MRT. Finally, the Court doesn't actually need to resolve any fundamental questions in this case about whether the Sixteenth Amendment requires realization.

15970,2023.22-800-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson,Let me ask you just another question about the government's brief. Why did the government make an argument about excise taxes at the end?,"<speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The MRT is firmly grounded in the Sixteenth Amendment's text and history. The amendment allows Congress to impose taxes on incomes. That phrase had a well-established meaning drawn from numerous preratification income taxes that Congress enacted before this Court's decision in Pollock. Several of those taxes were like the MRT in that they taxed shareholders on undistributed corporate earnings, including the income taxes in 1864, 1865, 1867, and 1870. And this Court upheld Congress's power to impose those taxes in Hubbard. The Sixteenth Amendment's drafters, therefore, would have understood taxes on incomes to include taxes like the MRT. That's confirmed by the very first income tax Congress enacted under the Sixteenth Amendment. That 1913 law taxed certain shareholders on their pro rata shares of undistributed corporate earnings. And the trend of pass-through taxation has continued throughout the next century from taxes on partners to S Corporation shareholders, to foreign corporation shareholders under Subpart F. Against all that history, Petitioners stake their case on Macomber. But the Court has limited Macomber to taxes on particular stock dividends that are not at issue here. If the Court now extended Macomber's discussion to invalidate all taxes on undistributed business earnings, it would cause a sea change in the operation of the Tax Code and cost several trillions of dollars in lost tax revenue. Petitioners say that every other provision of the Tax Code could be saved under a theory of constructive realization, but they don't provide a comprehensive definition of that term or explain why it would rescue every provision except the MRT. My friend today said it's a blanket term that's defined by the circumstances where you can say that constructive realization occurred. But that's simply circular. And by conceding constructive realization, they've acknowledged Congress's power to draw reasonable lines about what counts as income and who can be taxed on it, which is exactly what Congress did in the MRT. Finally, the Court doesn't actually need to resolve any fundamental questions in this case about whether the Sixteenth Amendment requires realization. The MRT taxes income that was actually realized by the foreign corporations, and Congress permissibly attributed the tax on that realized income to U.S. shareholders just as it has done in any number of pass-through taxes throughout our nation's history.

Prelogar</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  FDA approved mifepristone based on the agency's scientific judgment that the drug is safe and effective. It's maintained that judgment across five presidential administrations, and millions of Americans have used mifepristone to safely end their pregnancies. Respondents may not agree with that choice, but that doesn't give them Article III standing or a legal basis to upend the regulatory scheme. At the outset, Respondents lack standing. They now concede they can't rely on a statistical theory  of injury like the lower courts did. Instead, they have to identify a specific doctor who faces imminent harm. But their theories rest on a long chain of remote contingencies. Only an exceptionally small  number of women suffer the kind of serious complications that could trigger any need for emergency treatment. It's speculative that any  of those women would seek care from the two specific doctors who asserted conscience  injuries. And even if that happened, federal conscience protections would guard against the injury the doctors face. And there's no basis to conclude that any of that would be traceable to the incremental changes that FDA made in 2016 and 2021 as opposed to the availability of mifepristone in general. Respondents' theories are too attenuated as a matter of law. The Court should say so and put an end to this case. If the Court reaches the merits, FDA's actions were lawful. The agency relied on dozens of studies, involving tens of thousands of women. Respondents don't identify any evidence that the agency overlooked. They just disagree with the agency's analysis of the data before it, but that doesn't provide a license to authorize judicial second-guessing of the agency's expert judgments.

I think Justice Jackson is saying let's spot you all that, okay, with respect to your  --your clients. Normally, in Article III traditional equitable remedies, we issue and we say over and over again provide a remedy sufficient to address the plaintiff's asserted injuries and go no further. We have before us a handful of individuals who have asserted a conscience objection. Normally, we would allow equitable relief to address them. Recently, I think what Justice Jackson's alluding to, we've had one might call it a rash of universal injunctions or vacaturs.

Respondents may not agree with that choice, but that doesn't give them Article III standing or a legal basis to upend the regulatory scheme. At the outset, Respondents lack standing. They now concede they can't rely on a statistical theory  of injury like the lower courts did. Instead, they have to identify a specific doctor who faces imminent harm. But their theories rest on a long chain of remote contingencies. Only an exceptionally small  number of women suffer the kind of serious complications that could trigger any need for emergency treatment. It's speculative that any  of those women would seek care from the two specific doctors who asserted conscience  injuries. And even if that happened, federal conscience protections would guard against the injury the doctors face. And there's no basis to conclude that any of that would be traceable to the incremental changes that FDA made in 2016 and 2021 as opposed to the availability of mifepristone in general. Respondents' theories are too attenuated as a matter of law. The Court should say so and put an end to this case. If the Court reaches the merits, FDA's actions were lawful. The agency relied on dozens of studies, involving tens of thousands of women. Respondents don't identify any evidence that the agency overlooked. They just disagree with the agency's analysis of the data before it, but that doesn't provide a license to authorize judicial second-guessing of the agency's expert judgments. Finally, on remedy, the relief entered below would severely disrupt the federal system  for developing and approving drugs, harming the agency and the pharmaceutical industry. It would also inflict grave harm on women across the nation. Rolling back FDA's changes would unnecessarily restrict access to mifepristone  with no safety justification. Some women could be forced to undergo more invasive surgical abortions. Others might not be able to access the drug at all.

16326,2023.23-235 -t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett," Ms. Hawley, can I take you back to the affidavits and some of Justice Kagan's questions?  You were talking about Dr. Francis. And as I read her allegations or her  --as her affidavit reads, she said that her partner was forced to perform a D&C when there was a living fetus and she said she performed a D&C on a woman who was suffering serious complications, but the fact that she performed a D&C does not necessarily mean that there was a living embryo or a fetus because you can have a D&C after, you know, a miscarriage. So, if that's right, I mean, I think the difficulty here is that at least to me, these affidavits do read more like the conscience objection is strictly to actually participating in the abortion to end the life of the embryo or fetus.

Judges are familiar with drawing that line. And I'm interested in the law professors', evidence professors' brief because they point to one context in which that happens with fair frequency, which is with respect to eyewitness testimony. And they say courts often allow expert testimonial regarding factors that on average interfere with accurate eyewitness identifications. However, courts do not experts  to draw an individual inference and testify that a particular witness is likely inaccurate. They go on to say, because social science research isn't reliably -- even though it is itself replicated and reliable, it can't support a reliable statement about an individual case, especially when that social scientist hasn't really examined that individual case.

17389,2023.22-842-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr."," Mr. Katyal, what do you do about your friend's argument that you've waived this, not raising it in the distri ct court or the court of appeals or in the brief in opposition?","<speaker>David D. Cole</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Government officials are free to urge people not to support political groups they oppose. What they cannot do is use their regulatory might to add ""or else"" to that request. Respondent Vullo did just that. Not content to rely on the force of her ideas, she abused the coercive power of her office. In February 2018, she told Lloyd's, the insurance underwriter, that she'd go easy on its unrelated insurance viol ations if it aided her campaign to weaken the NRA by halting all business with the group. Lloyd's agreed. Six weeks later, she issued guidance letters and a press release directing the thousands of banks and insurance companies that she directly oversees to cut off their ties with  the NRA not because of any alleged illegality but because they promote guns. In the accompanying press release, Vullo's boss and co-defendant, Governor Andrew Cuomo, said he directed Vullo to issue the  guidance because doing business with the NRA ""sends the wrong message.""  Shortly thereafter,  Vullo extracted legally binding consent orders from the NRA's three principal insurance providers, barring them from ever providing affinity insurance to the group ever again, no matter how lawfully they do so. These actions worked as multiple financial institutions refused to do business with the NRA, citing Vullo's threats. This was not about enforcing insurance law or mere government speech. It was a campaign by the state's highest political officials to use their power to coerce a boycott of a political advocacy organization because they disagreed with its advocacy. Governor Cuomo essentially conceded as much in two tweets responding to this lawsuit in which he said, and I quote, ""The regulations New York put in place are working.

Kavanaugh," Mr. Katyal, it's a bit  jarring, I guess, for me that the Solicitor General is on the other side from you in this case given that the Solicitor General represents the United States and, as we know from the last case, has a very strong interest in not expanding Bantam Books.

17392,2023.22-842-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson," Mr. Katyal, can I just ask you about the standards again?  So suppose I agree with you that illegality was sort of at the heart of what was going on here, that all of the products were illegal. Let's just assume that I agree with you for a second on that. Doesn't that go less to coercion than to the next question, which is whether or not that coercion of a third party affected a violation of the First Amendment?  I mean, the fact that the business was illegal doesn't necessarily mean that the February meeting wasn't coercive. I think government action in enforcing the law is coercive. So isn't it just that she has a good  defense to the argument that there's a problem here under the First Amendment?","<speaker>David D.
