So how does that meet the clear error standard?","<speaker>John M. Gore</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: District 1 is not a racial gerrymander. Rather, the General Assembly largely preserved District 1 from the constitutional benchmark plan and made changes based on traditional criteria and politics. The panel acknowledged that the General Assembly pursued a political goal of increasing District 1's Republican vote share. It achieved that goal by moving Republicans into the district and Democrats out of the district. All of the direct evidence confirms that it used political data, not racial data, to identify Republicans and Democrats. The panel declared District 1 a racial gerrymander only by departing from this Court's precedents and adopting sua sponte an erroneous racial target theory. First, the panel failed to enforce the alternative map requirement. In a circumstantial case like this, only such an alternative can disentangle race and politics. Second, the panel's racial target theory hyper-entangled race and politics and simply makes no sense. The panel believed the General Assembly needed a racial target in Charleston County to achieve its political goal district-wide. But a 17 percent racial target says nothing about voter turnout, says nothing whatsoever about the predominant majority of voters in predominantly white Charleston County, and also is irreconcilable with District 1's recent electoral history. Moreover, even the panel agreed that the General Assembly made political changes in other parts of District 1 without using a racial target. The General Assembly had no reason to and did not use a racial target. It used political data to pursue its political goals. If left uncorrected, the decision below will undermine this Court's holding that partisan gerrymandering claims are not justiciable. Partisan gerrymandering claims can always be repackaged as racial gerrymandering claims if all plaintiffs in lower courts have to do is ignore direct evidence of intent, infer a racial target from the correlation between race and politics, and point to malleable expert analysis.

So this is what I'm a little concerned about because, to the extent that this distinction's turning on whether or not there is direct evidence, I wonder if it is reasonable to require such evidence or -- or say that such evidence would exist in a situation that is not a majority/majority -- a majority/minority district scenario. You can see how there would be direct evidence when the state's goal is to try to, in its view, comply with the VRA, they're trying to make a majority/minority district, so we're going to have some evidence of people saying that. But, in a situation like this, where that is not the case, where the state is saying instead, we are trying to, you know, achieve a partisan tilt, I guess I don't understand -- and, excuse me, we've also said that its, you know, intent to use race is a very hard thing to prove just on its own.

In other words, is this gerrymander based on politics, or is it a way to get to an ultimate goal, an ultimate political goal, but the gerrymandering is based on race? And what the two of them do is that they show that Black Democrats are excluded from District 1 at a far greater percentage than white Democrats are. So, you know, Liu says, what is it, 61 percent -- now I'm going to lose it -- 69 percent of white Democrats were -- were -- remained in the district, whereas only 51 percent of Black Democrats did. Ragusa's analysis, similarly clear, a little bit harder to state in one sentence. But -- but both experts essentially said: Look, we've done these regressions, and we can show you that Black Democrats and white Democrats are not being treated the same way, that Black Democrats are being excluded for the district at a far greater proportion. So, you know, every regression analysis has things that you can poke holes in, but you didn't give anything in response to that. It's not like you said: We have a better regression analysis.

Moreover, even the panel agreed that the General Assembly made political changes in other parts of District 1 without using a racial target. The General Assembly had no reason to and did not use a racial target. It used political data to pursue its political goals. If left uncorrected, the decision below will undermine this Court's holding that partisan gerrymandering claims are not justiciable. Partisan gerrymandering claims can always be repackaged as racial gerrymandering claims if all plaintiffs in lower courts have to do is ignore direct evidence of intent, infer a racial target from the correlation between race and politics, and point to malleable expert analysis. This Court should reverse and not allow its exacting precedents to be so easily subverted. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2023

353,2023.22-807-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett,"So I think the difficult thing about this case is that clear error review, we owe a lot of deference to the district court's findings. But we're also reviewing it in light of the legal standards, and I'm not -- I'm talking about factual, I'm not talking about the arguments that there was legal error here, but we're reviewing it in light of the fact that the plaintiffs bear an exceedingly heavy burden when they're trying to disentangle race and politics and that we give the legislature a presumption of good faith. So we're asking whether the district court made a clear error in light of the fact that it was judging the factual record with those things into account. And the Chief Justice has outlined, you know, kind of the sum I think in a -- in a pretty concise way of the evidence which was all circumstantial here.

And you pointed out, and -- and so did -- so did the Respondent, that they didn't point out an alternative map, but they had expert evidence that was just as good because it made similar points. But this is my question about Dr. Ragusa's evidence. Did it control for factors like contiguousness and compactness? Because Respondent pointed out in trying to address this problem, which I think is why, you know, that we've all been asking about and struggling with, that, you know, Respondents said, well, some of the experts testified about traditional districting criteria and some testified about attempts to disentangle race and politics, and they were all showing different things, but did anybody consider all of them?

357,2023.22-807-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"Okay. And -- and with respect to this question about maps and alternative map, I'm just wondering whether or not an alternative map is helpful with respect to the contention that the district was being oddly manufactured with respect to who was being moved in or out. This is similar to the question that I asked plaintiffs' counsel. My understanding is that politics is driving it at a sort of meta level, and the map-maker identifies a Republican-leaning district that he would like to include. That Republican-leaning district has both white and Black voters in it. And so one would assume that just by that move, the BVAP goes up. I don't know if that's right, but I'm just -- I'm walk -- I'm walking it through. But, in this situation, the BVAP stays the same at the end of the day and we have evidence that the map-maker went into the rest of the district and moved out a certain number of Democratic-leaning voters who happened to be Black or plaintiffs say because they were Black, but that's what makes the BVAP remain the same. It's that we've now moved out Black Democrats to account for, I guess, the Republican-leaning district that we have included. Is the use of race in that way, you know, I have now got a higher BVAP than I want, and I'm moving out Black voters, not white Democrats, Black Democrats, in order to bring the BVAP down, is that a violation in -- in this world?","<speaker>John M.

359,2023.22-807-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,So the government's position is that you don't necessarily have to have a map and you don't necessarily have to have direct evidence. We've been hearing a lot about the lack of direct evidence in this case. Is there a world in which you can put together a case that demonstrates that race is actually operative in this environment without direct evidence and without a map?,"<speaker>John M. Gore</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: District 1 is not a racial gerrymander. Rather, the General Assembly largely preserved District 1 from the constitutional benchmark plan and made changes based on traditional criteria and politics. The panel acknowledged that the General Assembly pursued a political goal of increasing District 1's Republican vote share. It achieved that goal by moving Republicans into the district and Democrats out of the district. All of the direct evidence confirms that it used political data, not racial data, to identify Republicans and Democrats. The panel declared District 1 a racial gerrymander only by departing from this Court's precedents and adopting sua sponte an erroneous racial target theory. First, the panel failed to enforce the alternative map requirement. In a circumstantial case like this, only such an alternative can disentangle race and politics. Second, the panel's racial target theory hyper-entangled race and politics and simply makes no sense. The panel believed the General Assembly needed a racial target in Charleston County to achieve its political goal district-wide. But a 17 percent racial target says nothing about voter turnout, says nothing whatsoever about the predominant majority of voters in predominantly white Charleston County, and also is irreconcilable with District 1's recent electoral history. Moreover, even the panel agreed that the General Assembly made political changes in other parts of District 1 without using a racial target. The General Assembly had no reason to and did not use a racial target. It used political data to pursue its political goals.

Etsy is a marketplace like -- if  -- I'm going to try to analogize it to physical space, which I think in this area is a little crazy, because it  -- yes, in some ways, this is like an online bookstore and online magazines, online newspaper, online whatever you want to call it, an online supermarket, but it's not because, even though it has infinite space, it really doesn't because viewers, myself incl uded, or users can't access the millions of things that are on the Internet and actually get through them and pick the things we want because there's too much information. So we're limited  by human attention spans. So are they. So our theories are a little hard, but let's look at Etsy. Etsy is a supermarket that wants to sell only vintage clothes, and so it is going to and does limit users' content. It's a free marketplace, it's open to everyone, but it says to the people who come onto its marketplace we only want this kind of product. They're going to have to censor. They're going to have to take people off. They're going to have to do all the things that your laws say they can't do without all of these conditions. Why is that?  Why should we be permitting and under what level of scrutiny would we be lo oking at this broad application of -- 11 this law that affects someone who all they want to do is sell a particular kind of product and they have community standards and they tell you  that they don't want you to curse, they don't want you to talk politics, they don't want you to do whatever, all they want you to do is sell your product.

And, you know, Justice Sotomayor brought up Etsy.

It looks a lot more like a brick-and-mortar marketplace or flea market, you know, than, you know, a place for hosting speech. Okay?  So, if this is a facial challenge and Florida's law indeed is broad enough to cover a lot of this conduct which is farther away from expression than these standard social media platforms, why didn't you then in your brief  kind of defend it by pointing out, look, there's all this other stuff that's perfectly fine that Florida covers.

726,2023.22-277-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor," General, I think I'm finally understanding the argument, but let me make sure I do, okay?  When I came in, I had  the reaction Justice Alito did, which is we should vacate and remand. And I have been thinking about what does that do to the preliminary injunction, because I agree with you, as  I understand what the State did below, was to say we don't have to offer you any justification for any part of our law because everybody of these social media companies are common  carriers. And I think what's clear is  --from our questioning -- that that's not true, that there are many functions that are expressive that we can't say are common carriers. But, even if we did say they were like common carriers, the issue would be one of what's the level of scrutiny. And the State said there's no level of scrutiny we're going to address. They basically said we can do anything we want to common carriers and to any of the expressive platforming or deplatforming things. But I don't even think that's true. They can't come in and -- and I'm not sure they can  --do any of these things or some of these things even to common carriers if it is a sort of content or viewpoint content exclusion. So a common carrier doesn't have to permit unruly behavior. It doesn't have to permit -- it can throw somebody off the train if they are threatening somebody else or if they're doing other things. So I guess what you're saying is let's keep the injunction in place, vacate and remand -- affirm on the preliminary injunction but vacate and remand on the application of this law and how based on what level of scrutiny given the function that's at issue, correct?","<speaker>Henry C.

730,2023.22-277-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh," But I think he asked a good, thought-provoking, important question and used the term ""Orwellian.""  When I think of ""Orwellian,"" I think of the state, not the private sector, not private individuals. Maybe people have different conceptions of ""Orwellian,"" but the state taking over media, like in some other countries. And in Tornillo, we made clear, the Court made clear, that we don't want to be that -- that country, that we have a different model here and have since the beginning, and we don't want the state interfering with these private choices. Now Tornillo then dealt with -- and this is my question. Tornillo dealt with the  idea, well, newspapers have become so concentrated and so big that maybe we should have a different rule. In Tornillo, in the Court's opinion, Chief Justice Burger's opinion for a unanimous court talked about those  -- those changes. I mentioned those before. He says, ""Those changes have placed in a few hands th e power to inform the American people and shape public opinion. The abuses of bias and manipulative reportage are said to be the result of vast accumulations of unreviewable power in the modern media empires. In effect, it is claimed the public has lost any ability to respond. The monopoly of means of communication allows for little or no critical analysis of the media.""  And then, though, he -- and he says, ""From this premise, his reason that that the only effective way to ensure fairness and accura cy to provide for some accountability is for government to take affirmative action.""  And then he goes on and explains no, we're not going to do that. The First Amendment stands against that. ""However much validity may be found in  these arguments, at each point, the implementation of a remedy calls for some mechanism, either government or consensual. And  if it's governmental, that's just one brings about a confrontation with the express provisions of the First Amendment. Compelling  editors or publishers to publish that which reason tells them should not be published is what is at issue in this case.""  And so he says for the Court in 1973, no, we're not -- we don't have a big exception to the idea that the First Amendment distinguishes the state from the private sector and private individuals.

""Not just Amazon department stores, those people are likely not exempt, and here's why. There was a distinction that was made between railroads that shipped things for the public and I think that's how we normally understood -- understand seamen and railroad employees and say a coal company's internal railroads.

"" We have seamen and railroad employees, the two classes of workers that had preexisting dispute resolution statutes at the time and were commonly understood categories.""

Prelogar</speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  On January 6th, 2021, a violent mob stormed the United States Capitol and disrupted the peaceful transition of power. Many crimes occurred that day, but in plain English, the fundamental wrong committed by many of the rioters, including Petitioner, was a deliberate attempt to stop the joint session of Congress from certifying the results of the election. That is, they obstructed Congress's work in that proceeding. The government accordingly charged Petitioner with violating Section 1512(c)(2), an  obstruction offense that directly reads onto his conduct. The case as it comes to this Court presents a straightforward question of statutory interpretation:  Did Petitioner obstruct, influence, or impede the joint session of Congress?  The answer is equally straightforward. Yes, he obstructed that official proceeding. The terms of the statute unambiguously encompass his conduct. Petitioner doesn't really argue that his actions fall outside the plain meaning of what it is to obstruct. Instead, he asks this Court to impose an atextual limit on the actus reus. In his view, because Section 1512(c)(1) covers tampering with documents and other physical evidence, the separate  prohibition in Section 1512(c)(2) should be limited to acts of evidence impairment. But that limit has no basis in the text or tools of construction. His reading  hinges on the word ""otherwise,"" but that word means in a different manner, not in the same manner. And the two prohibitions in Section  1512(c)(2) aren't unified items on a list where you could apply associated words canons. They're separate provisions. They have their own sets of verbs and their own nouns. They each independently prohibit attempts, which would be duplication that makes no sense on Petitioner's reading. And Congress included a distinct mental state requirement in (c)(1) that it chose not to repeat in (c)(2). Section 1512(c)(2) by its terms is not limited to evidence impairment.

Many crimes occurred that day, but in plain English, the fundamental wrong committed by many of the rioters, including Petitioner, was a deliberate attempt to stop the joint session of Congress from certifying the results of the election. That is, they obstructed Congress's work in that proceeding. The government accordingly charged Petitioner with violating Section 1512(c)(2), an  obstruction offense that directly reads onto his conduct. The case as it comes to this Court presents a straightforward question of statutory interpretation:  Did Petitioner obstruct, influence, or impede the joint session of Congress?  The answer is equally straightforward. Yes, he obstructed that official proceeding. The terms of the statute unambiguously encompass his conduct. Petitioner doesn't really argue that his actions fall outside the plain meaning of what it is to obstruct. Instead, he asks this Court to impose an atextual limit on the actus reus. In his view, because Section 1512(c)(1) covers tampering with documents and other physical evidence, the separate  prohibition in Section 1512(c)(2) should be limited to acts of evidence impairment. But that limit has no basis in the text or tools of construction. His reading  hinges on the word ""otherwise,"" but that word means in a different manner, not in the same manner. And the two prohibitions in Section  1512(c)(2) aren't unified items on a list where you could apply associated words canons. They're separate provisions. They have their own sets of verbs and their own nouns. They each independently prohibit attempts, which would be duplication that makes no sense on Petitioner's reading. And Congress included a distinct mental state requirement in (c)(1) that it chose not to repeat in (c)(2). Section 1512(c)(2) by its terms is not limited to evidence impairment. Instead, it's a classic catchall. (c)(1) covers specified acts that obstruct an official proceeding, and (c)(2) covers all other acts that obstruct an official proceeding in a different manner.

Respondents have not asked this Court to overrule Atlas or the long line of precedents on which it rested, and they also haven't identified any relevant distinction between that case and this one. Second, Congress does not violate the nondelegation doctrine when it gives an agency the choice of pursuing administrative or judicial proceedings. The decision whether and how to pursue enforcement action is a quintessentially executive power, and Congress doesn't violate the Constitution when it leaves that decision to executive discretion, as it has traditionally done. Finally, the APA's limited removal protection for ALJs is entirely consistent with this Court's decision in Free Enterprise Fund. There, the Court confronted an unprecedented agency, a powerful law enforcement board, that was insulated from removal because -- by an unusually stringent provision and that was not subject to the SEC's control. Here, in contrast, ALJs are purely adjudicative officers who are subject to the Commission's plenary control and review of their decisions, and the APA's modest for-cause removal standard gives the Commission ample authority to remove those ALJs if they fail to accept supervision.

4991,2023.22-859-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"I don't understand why the forum is the first question. I thought that the first question was, what is the nature of the claim? In other words, is this a common law action? The concern that you mentioned many times was is the law of fraud being federalized. And when the law of fraud is being federalized, the Seventh Amendment is implicated because what the Seventh Amendment is doing is protecting the right of a person who has a common law fraud claim to bring it in federal court and not have it directed into some forum where they don't get a jury trial. So it seems to me that the initial question is, what is the right or the duty or whatever that is being established? And so Atlas Roofing begins by acknowledging that the Act created a new statutory duty, right? So, when we have this new statutory duty, it's not a common law duty, the question is, can this new duty be directed to an administrative tribunal without Seventh Amendment protections or not? And Atlas Roofing says of course because it's a new duty. It's not -- we're not worried that they are stealing the common law claims and putting it into this situation. So, for me, the answer is not starting with, where is this taking place? It's starting with, what is the claim or the duty at issue?

And the extent of impact of government agencies on daily life today is enormously more significant than it was 50 years ago. I mean, does that have any -- should that be a concern for us or a consideration when we're trying to consider what power the government has to take away the jury trial right or, as an antecedent to that, to take away the right to go into court? I mean, the government is much more likely to affect you and proceed against you before one of its own agencies than in court, and that concern and that threat is far greater today than when Atlas Roofing was set up. And -- and as a general matter, it does seem to me to be curious that and unlike most constitutional rights that you have that right until the government decides that they don't want you to have it.

Second, Congress does not violate the nondelegation doctrine when it gives an agency the choice of pursuing administrative or judicial proceedings. The decision whether and how to pursue enforcement action is a quintessentially executive power, and Congress doesn't violate the Constitution when it leaves that decision to executive discretion, as it has traditionally done. Finally, the APA's limited removal protection for ALJs is entirely consistent with this Court's decision in Free Enterprise Fund. There, the Court confronted an unprecedented agency, a powerful law enforcement board, that was insulated from removal because -- by an unusually stringent provision and that was not subject to the SEC's control. Here, in contrast, ALJs are purely adjudicative officers who are subject to the Commission's plenary control and review of their decisions, and the APA's modest for-cause removal standard gives the Commission ample authority to remove those ALJs if they fail to accept supervision.

5031,2023.22-859-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"So I agree that Atlas Roofing resolves this case, but like many of my colleagues, I guess I don't understand your reading of Atlas Roofing as suggesting there's no Seventh Amendment issue at all if the fact-finding function is assigned to the agency. I mean, the case begins, sentence one, the issue in this case -- in -- in these cases is whether, consistent with the Seventh Amendment, Congress may create a new cause of action in the government for civil penalties enforceable in an administrative agency where there is no jury trial. You seem to say, well, it depends on whether Congress has assigned resolution of this to the agency. But that seems totally conclusory and circular to me. And I think the question is, when does the Seventh Amendment prohibit Congress from assigning it to the agency as opposed to giving it to an Article III court? You say that's forum-dependent, but -- but the -- the question is, when can they give it to one forum versus the other? And in my view, the Seventh Amendment and what Atlas Roofing is saying is that it's -- it's claim-dependent. It's the part of your argument where you talk about is this a situation in which Congress is taking a common law duty, right, action, or whatever and moving it into the administrative process? And so the Seventh Amendment says you can't do that. If a person has a common law right of fraud, right, the common law creates duties like the duty not to make a representation that people rely on to their detriment. And it's established a right of action in private parties to enforce that duty. They can come to court. And the Seventh Circuit -- the Seventh Amendment says, when you have such a right to enforce that duty, you are -- by the Constitution, you have -- you -- you have the ability to come to court. The government can't make you go to some administrative tribunal and have no jury. All right? But there are also other duties in the world. Those duties can be created by statute, right? They're not common law duties. And when you have a new duty -- Atlas Roofing many, many times talks about this being a new statutory duty that has been created.

5042,2023.22-859-t01,respondent,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"Exactly, Mr. McColloch. And so I'm asking, why isn't the reason that the private/private cases are hard because the Court is concerned that what might be happening is Congress is shifting things that were traditionally common law claims adjudicated between private people into this administrative process and not people -- giving people trials by juries? Like, what makes it hard is when a statutory scheme looks like it could be displacing the normal common law private-to- private enforcement of a fraud claim. But I think what Justice Kagan is saying is that the reason why these cases, the ones in which the statute is giving the enforcement authority to the government for the benefit of the public, are not hard and why people haven't continued to bring these is because it doesn't look anything like the common law scenario where we've had two private parties fighting over fraud and they brought it to court. Instead, Congress has created a new thing to supplement that private scenario or maybe it's brand new in any event, but it doesn't -- it's not a common-law-rooted kind of thing that is being brought in court -- I mean, sorry, brought in the administrative agency with all the concerns that many of my colleagues have raised.","<speaker>S.

Your regulations are interesting because they -- they suggest that a lot of things are required in a notice to appear, except stuff that the government finds inconvenient, like the hearing date, and try to resuscitate the pre-statutory regime that existed before where the government could issue as many notices as it wanted. So the regulations themselves may or may not comply with the statute and they -- as Justice Barrett pointed out, they may or may not change. The only statutory hook I think you've identified to save the problem is the clear and convincing evidence requirement, but that's just a clear and convincing evidence requirement that the notice was given.

As a matter of the statutory language, for purposes of determining whether the non-citizen by clear and convincing evidence is removable, is it possible if only the notice of hearing has been provided for the IJ to make that determination? I mean, I guess, according to the statute, the government could simply say and launch into a whole new explanation that wasn't included in any NTA about why the alien or the non-citizen is removable.","<speaker>Charles L.

5267,2023.22-674-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"Can we go back to the distinction, if any, between the stop-time rule and in absentia removal? I understood you to respond to Justice Kavanaugh by saying that the government's position is that the stop-time rule gives the government a procedural advantage, the ability to thwart the accrual of time, and so that's why the government has to dot all the I's and -- and cross all the T's with respect to that. But I guess I see this as exactly -- ""this"" meaning in absentia removal -- as exactly the same thing, because, ordinarily, a non-citizen would be entitled to a hearing where he or she could make an argument and advocate for themselves about removal, and the statute allows the government to get around that in a sense by allowing the -- the government to get a removal order in the absence of adversarial presentation by the person who doesn't show up. And so I guess what I'm trying -- still struggling with is why we would have a world in which a statute that requires the government to give notice in order to be able to get a removal in absentia order would allow for that notice to be deficient in any way.

As this Court has recognized time and again, the touchstone of the remedial inquiry is congressional intent. And, here, there's unusually strong evidence that Congress would choose to fix the constitutional violation by mandating uniformly higher fees. That means the appropriate remedy in this case is a mandate of higher fees nationwide, either standing alone or in combination with a retrospective effort to collect the $3.8 million in fees that the BA debtors collectively underpaid. Now Respondents instead urge a refund remedy which when applied nationwide would require taxpayers to foot the bill for approximately $326 million to fund windfalls for the largest users of the bankruptcy system, like Respondents, who paid exactly what Congress intended that they pay. The problem with that approach is that as a practical matter, it'll actually make the disparity larger. Worse yet, it goes directly contrary to congressional intent. Congress has for decades sought to make the bankruptcy system self-sustaining at no cost to the taxpayer, and it enacted the 2017 Act fee increase for that reason. Now Respondents' argument that the Due Process Clause compels this topsy-turvy solution simply don't hold up. Respondents must establish both that the Due Process Clause requires retrospective relief and that that retrospective relief must take the form of refunds. But they cannot make either showing.

6866,2023.22-1238-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,"Ms. Hansford, I -- I'm troubled by one piece of this case, okay? I do agree McKesson and Harper say, if you have a pre-deprivation mechanism to protect yourself, the government can level up or down because you should have taken advantage of your ability to protect yourself. Putting aside Respondents' argument that if they didn't pay the fee here, they would have been thrown out of court -- and I agree that there's examples of people who didn't pay the fee. They put the money in escrow, or some actually withheld it and didn't get thrown out. So there -- assuming there's a pre-deprivation remedy, which I do, okay, and I think McKesson would control, there's a part of your argument that troubles me, and it's with the people who invoked the remedy, meaning I under -- in normal course of litigation, if you think you shouldn't pay something, don't pay it. Go to court and don't pay it. And some people did that. But now you're saying to them you did the right thing to protect yourself from the inequality, but now I can claw back that money when I level down -- or level up, I mean. To me, that doesn't seem quite right. The clawback is what's troubling me because, if you claw back, there really is no pre-deprivation remedy. You're going to end up having had to pay and continuing to pay something you thought was unequal at the time. And so there's my -- the nub of my problem. It's the clawback. It's less the -- the concept that you can level up or down and say that people who paid and shouldn't have, well, that's their problem. They should have -- that's -- you know, they knew that they might be paying or should have known they were paying more and should have protected themselves, and they chose not to.

Hansford</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents the question that this Court left open in Siegel, what the appropriate remedy is for the uniformity violation that resulted when debtors in a small sliver of cases, four dozen cases, in the two states that use bankruptcy administrators did not pay the increased quarterly fees mandated by Congress in the U.S. Trustee districts. As this Court has recognized time and again, the touchstone of the remedial inquiry is congressional intent. And, here, there's unusually strong evidence that Congress would choose to fix the constitutional violation by mandating uniformly higher fees. That means the appropriate remedy in this case is a mandate of higher fees nationwide, either standing alone or in combination with a retrospective effort to collect the $3.8 million in fees that the BA debtors collectively underpaid. Now Respondents instead urge a refund remedy which when applied nationwide would require taxpayers to foot the bill for approximately $326 million to fund windfalls for the largest users of the bankruptcy system, like Respondents, who paid exactly what Congress intended that they pay. The problem with that approach is that as a practical matter, it'll actually make the disparity larger. Worse yet, it goes directly contrary to congressional intent. Congress has for decades sought to make the bankruptcy system self-sustaining at no cost to the taxpayer, and it enacted the 2017 Act fee increase for that reason. Now Respondents' argument that the Due Process Clause compels this topsy-turvy solution simply don't hold up.

But, as I was sitting down, like, with my law clerk and we were debating this, we were trying to figure out, in many equal protection cases, which would be, you know, similar to the Uniformity Clause, where you're talking about discriminatory treatment, the kind of relief sought is just to end the disparity moving forward and it's equitable relief that's sought, which seems to me a possible distinction between citizenship and -- and those sorts of things.

Because there's a world in which what we're talking about here is how impossible it is to give a retrospective remedy in this case either leveling up or leveling down. You've made very ably the argument for why it's impossible to do it retrospectively leveling up. And Justice Kagan points to the argument about why it's impossible to do it retrospectively leveling down because it's inconsistent with the entirety of the bankruptcy scheme as Congress has laid it forward.

8085,2023.22-451-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas, How do you  --how do we discern statu tory --delegation from statutory silence?,"<speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Throughout this litigation and at times this morning, Petitioners have sought to characterize this case as presenting  a fundamental question of the separation of powers and a test of Article III:  Will courts continue  to say what the law is?  But I think, stepping back, I want to make sure that what doesn't get lost in the shuffle is that Petitioners have made an important concession that I think illustrates  that the issue here is actually far narrower and that their attacks on Chevron lack merit and are unnecessary. The concession is this:  Petitioners acknowledge that Congress can expressly delegate to agencies the authority to define statutory terms and fill gaps. Imagine, for example, if the statute said, in Chevron, ""stationary source"" as defined by the Administrator. I take both Petitioners to give that up and recognize that is a delegation and courts should respect that. The role of the court in that circumstance is to make sure that the agency has followed the proper procedures and stayed what -- within whatever outer bounds Congress itself has set. And all of that complies with the Constitution, of course, because Congress has  Article I authority to delegate gap-filling authority to agencies, and the executive has core Article II authority to fill in those gaps. That's a core exercise of the executive power. And then the Article III courts are just fulfilling their judicial role when they give effect to what Congress has done in its choice to rely on the agency in that regard. But I think what all of this shows is that the constitutional attacks on Chev ron and the suggestion that it's egregiously wrong in that regard lack merit because there is no constitutional distinction between that kind of express delegation and the delegations recognized in Chevron. If Congress can expressly vest an agency with authority to interpret the law through an express delegation, then it can do the same thing implicitly, especially in a world where Congress has to provide the agency with the express authority to carry the statute into operation with the force and effect of law. Now we can debate, of course, whether Chevron drew the right line in identifying exactly when these delegations have occurred. I think the Court got that right for all of the reasons I tried to explain this morning. But I  think it's important to recognize that that debate doesn't have a constitutional dimension to it that falls out of the equation. Instead, it's just a question of whether the Court drew the right line in identifying when a delegation has occurred. And if you recognize that, then I think what's left over are the practical concerns that have been raised about Chevron. And I don't want to diminish the force of the concerns that some members of the Court have articulated, but I also think that those concerns are manageable. The Court could do in this case what it did in Kisor. It could clarify and articulate the limits of Chevron deference without taking the drastic step of upending decades of settled precedent.

The role of the court in that circumstance is to make sure that the agency has followed the proper procedures and stayed what -- within whatever outer bounds Congress itself has set. And all of that complies with the Constitution, of course, because Congress has  Article I authority to delegate gap-filling authority to agencies, and the executive has core Article II authority to fill in those gaps. That's a core exercise of the executive power. And then the Article III courts are just fulfilling their judicial role when they give effect to what Congress has done in its choice to rely on the agency in that regard. But I think what all of this shows is that the constitutional attacks on Chev ron and the suggestion that it's egregiously wrong in that regard lack merit because there is no constitutional distinction between that kind of express delegation and the delegations recognized in Chevron. If Congress can expressly vest an agency with authority to interpret the law through an express delegation, then it can do the same thing implicitly, especially in a world where Congress has to provide the agency with the express authority to carry the statute into operation with the force and effect of law. Now we can debate, of course, whether Chevron drew the right line in identifying exactly when these delegations have occurred. I think the Court got that right for all of the reasons I tried to explain this morning. But I  think it's important to recognize that that debate doesn't have a constitutional dimension to it that falls out of the equation. Instead, it's just a question of whether the Court drew the right line in identifying when a delegation has occurred. And if you recognize that, then I think what's left over are the practical concerns that have been raised about Chevron. And I don't want to diminish the force of the concerns that some members of the Court have articulated, but I also think that those concerns are manageable. The Court could do in this case what it did in Kisor. It could clarify and articulate the limits of Chevron deference without taking the drastic step of upending decades of settled precedent.

But often the government seeks deference for adjudications between individual parties and then apply that to everybody without notice to them, or deference for interpretive rules for which no notice-and-comment, let alone formal rulemaking or adjudicatory proceedings, is required.

Prelogar</speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Throughout this litigation and at times this morning, Petitioners have sought to characterize this case as presenting  a fundamental question of the separation of powers and a test of Article III:  Will courts continue  to say what the law is?  But I think, stepping back, I want to make sure that what doesn't get lost in the shuffle is that Petitioners have made an important concession that I think illustrates  that the issue here is actually far narrower and that their attacks on Chevron lack merit and are unnecessary. The concession is this:  Petitioners acknowledge that Congress can expressly delegate to agencies the authority to define statutory terms and fill gaps. Imagine, for example, if the statute said, in Chevron, ""stationary source"" as defined by the Administrator. I take both Petitioners to give that up and recognize that is a delegation and courts should respect that. The role of the court in that circumstance is to make sure that the agency has followed the proper procedures and stayed what -- within whatever outer bounds Congress itself has set. And all of that complies with the Constitution, of course, because Congress has  Article I authority to delegate gap-filling authority to agencies, and the executive has core Article II authority to fill in those gaps. That's a core exercise of the executive power. And then the Article III courts are just fulfilling their judicial role when they give effect to what Congress has done in its choice to rely on the agency in that regard. But I think what all of this shows is that the constitutional attacks on Chev ron and the suggestion that it's egregiously wrong in that regard lack merit because there is no constitutional distinction between that kind of express delegation and the delegations recognized in Chevron. If Congress can expressly vest an agency with authority to interpret the law through an express delegation, then it can do the same thing implicitly, especially in a world where Congress has to provide the agency with the express authority to carry the statute into operation with the force and effect of law. Now we can debate, of course, whether Chevron drew the right line in identifying exactly when these delegations have occurred. I think the Court got that right for all of the reasons I tried to explain this morning.

In other words, I mean, it's a  -- it's a procedural rule that occurs prior to the sentencing. That's what you've argued, right?  You have to issue this preliminary order of forfeiture. And so let's say the court doesn't do that. You say that the individual should be entitled to enforce it.

If you think that what the rule is about is  --is allowing notice to the defendant, so it's prepared for whatever the final order is going to say, it seems to me that that's  -- even if it's jurisdictional, as you say, that means you can't rely on the existing order to give notice, but it doesn't mean you can't just give notice, you know, a week later, give him the same benefit that he would get if the rule were complied with?",<speaker>Steven Y.

And you say the district court failed to issue the preliminary order of forfeiture before that sentence and two years later, when it did issue a preliminary order of forfeiture with respect to that sentence, that was too late, that the first forfeiture order was invalid.

So that put a duty on the applicant, not the court.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The timing requirement in Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) is mandatory, not discretionary, but characterizing that requirement as mandatory doesn't answer the question pr esented in this case. The question here is, what follows when a district court violates the rule?  What are the consequences?  Now our basic submission in this case is that a violation of Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) should be treated like any other garden-variety procedural error in the sentencing process. When a court commits a procedural error at sentencing, the normal thing to do is to apply Rule 52, which is the provision in the Federal Rules that codifies principles of harmless error and plain error. Under Rule 52(a), if an error does not affect the defendant's substantial rights, it must be disregarded as harmless. Petitioner tries to avoid the application of harmless error principles by characterizing this particular  requirement as a mandatory claim-processing rule. Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) is not such a rule for all the reasons that this Court identified in Dolan with respect to the analogous timing requirement in the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act. Let me just emphasize three of the considerations that the Court stressed in Dolan: text, context, and purpose. Textually, the rule here imposes an obligation on the court, not the litigants, and it does not specify any sanction for the court's violation. That text operates in the broader context of a statutory framework that  makes clear that criminal forfeiture is a mandatory consequence of conviction and that forfeiture is part of the sentence imposed for the offense. The purpose of requiring the entry of a preliminary order before sentencing is to ensure that the forfeiture that is actually imposed at the sentencing itself is accurate and complete. Accordingly, when a district court neglects to enter a preliminary order of forfeiture before sentencing, in violation of  Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B), the court may nonetheless proceed to order forfeiture at the sentencing itself as long as the court's violation was harmless.

Now our basic submission in this case is that a violation of Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) should be treated like any other garden-variety procedural error in the sentencing process. When a court commits a procedural error at sentencing, the normal thing to do is to apply Rule 52, which is the provision in the Federal Rules that codifies principles of harmless error and plain error. Under Rule 52(a), if an error does not affect the defendant's substantial rights, it must be disregarded as harmless. Petitioner tries to avoid the application of harmless error principles by characterizing this particular  requirement as a mandatory claim-processing rule. Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) is not such a rule for all the reasons that this Court identified in Dolan with respect to the analogous timing requirement in the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act. Let me just emphasize three of the considerations that the Court stressed in Dolan: text, context, and purpose. Textually, the rule here imposes an obligation on the court, not the litigants, and it does not specify any sanction for the court's violation. That text operates in the broader context of a statutory framework that  makes clear that criminal forfeiture is a mandatory consequence of conviction and that forfeiture is part of the sentence imposed for the offense. The purpose of requiring the entry of a preliminary order before sentencing is to ensure that the forfeiture that is actually imposed at the sentencing itself is accurate and complete. Accordingly, when a district court neglects to enter a preliminary order of forfeiture before sentencing, in violation of  Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B), the court may nonetheless proceed to order forfeiture at the sentencing itself as long as the court's violation was harmless. And we think that's what occurred here. The district court orally ordered Petitioner to forfeit the proceeds of his Hobbs Act robberies and a car that he purchased with those proceeds, despite the absence of a preliminary order before sentencing. That error was harmless. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2023
