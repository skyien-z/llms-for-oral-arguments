You say you're not enforcing the NAAG guidelines?","<speaker>Stephen Gardner</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress did not intend to strip the State of Texas of its right to use its traditional police powers to protect its citizens from deceptive airline advertising. Congress never suggested that Texas is not free to sue individual airlines in its state courts for specific violations of its general state consumer protection act, yet that is precisely the result of the decision of a court below. The district court entered and the court of appeals sustained a sweeping injunction against Texas that prohibited the State from any type of law enforcement action that would regulate or restrict any aspect of the individually named plaintiff airline's airfare advertising or their other operations involving their rates, routes, and services. If I may take just a few moments to put this case into context for the Court. This case arose when the State of Texas and several other state attorneys general wrote to a few airlines in November of 1988 advising them that their practices of segmenting out certain portions of their airfares from the advertised fare and putting it into the fine print of the footnotes of an advertisement, thereby reducing an ad from, say, $321 to $298, were violations of their state deceptive practices laws. We wrote to only five of the airlines that are in this litigation. We offered those airlines an opportunity to resolve this matter without litigation. Rather than taking us up on that offer the airlines themselves brought suit in Federal district court against first, the State of Texas, and later expanded that lawsuit to include 33 other state attorneys general. From that lawsuit the district court entered a preliminary injunction that was later converted to a permanent injunction that was as I have already set forth. What this case is about is the right of the State of Texas to enforce its state consumer protection act to stop illegal, deceptive segmenting out of surcharges. It's not about anything broader than that. It is specifically not about the NAAG guidelines that the airlines make a bit about in their brief. We're not here before the Court on enforcement of the NAAG guidelines because the states never attempted to do so.</text>",1991

He is--","<speaker>Alvin J. Bronstein</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I represent, by appointment of this Court, the petitioner, Keith Hudson, a prisoner at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, Louisiana. On the night of October 30, 1983, Mr. Hudson had an exchange of words with one of the respondents, Sergeant McMillian. The officer decided to give Hudson a disciplinary charge, two charges I believe, and to comport with the policy, McMillian then called another officer, the respondent Sergeant Woods and again, by virtue of policy, called their ranking superior, Lieutenant Mezo. The officers placed Hudson in full restraints before moving in to a disciplinary cell which is referred to in the record as the dungeon. Full restraints consisted of handcuffs, attached to waist chains and shackles or leg irons. In other words, Hudson was essentially immobilized. The two sergeants then led Hudson out of his cell, down a corridor and out of sight of any other prisoners in their cells. They stopped, and at that point the two sergeants, both of whom were over 6 feet tall and each weighing 200 or more pounds, began to beat the petitioner. Sergeant Woods held him from behind and hit him in the back. McMillian repeatedly punched Hudson about the face, mouth, and chest. Lieutenant Mezo stood by and observing the beating and saying only, quote: ""Don't be having too much fun, boys. "" Hudson sustained some injuries, bruises and swelling to his face, mouth and lip; a split lower lip; and a cracked dental plate, a few bruises on his body. After the beating ended he was taken and thrown into the disciplinary cell. He brought a pro se action under the civil rights act, and the case proceeded to a full trial. The trial court, after reviewing the testimony of various witnesses and certain exhibits, they heard from a number of prisoners, a number of officers, found essentially the facts that I have just recited. The trial court went on to find that there was no need to use any force because the petitioner was already in restraints, that the force used was excessive, and that the respondents' conduct was, quote: ""can only be seen as motivated by malice. "" The court found that Hudson's Eight Amendment rights were violated and awarded him $800 in compensatory damages. The court of appeals did not disturb any of the findings... the trial court's factual findings. Indeed, it repeated them and deplored the use of unnecessary force in the treatment of prisoners, calling it a blight on the criminal justice system. The Fifth Circuit stated that because no force was required in this case, the force used was objectively unreasonable. The conduct of the respondents, the court said, and again I quote: ""qualified as clearly excessive and occasioned unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. "" End quote. However, the court of appeals went on to reverse the judgment of the trial court because it found that Hudson did not suffer a significant injury, one prong of a four-element standard for Eighth Amendment violations, constructed by the Fifth Circuit, without any reference to any decision of this Court. The court of appeals refers only to a prior Eighth Amendment decision in its court in the Fifth Circuit which in turn relies solely on a Fourth Amendment case in the circuit that misreads this Court's decision in Graham v. Connor.</text>",1991

16363,1991.91-1502-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Well, assuming there is review, an enumeration is exactly what took place in this case. The Secretary didn't estimate the number of servicepeople abroad. It didn't take a sample and then extrapolate from that. The Secretary counted them, 918,810, not 809 and not 811. Now, the Secretary counted them from forms, but that is how the census is conducted by and large. When you get a census form in the mail, it asks you to fill it out, or the head of the household, and state how many people are living at that home. You list yourself, a spouse, three children, the form is returned. The Census Bureau counts from that form, but that is still an actual enumeration. And indeed, historically, it was considered sufficient, for example in the case of a prison, to ask the warden how many prisoners were there, or significantly, in the case of a military base, to rely on data provided by the commander. And even if, in the normal case, if the Census Bureau has trouble reaching someone, they will go and ask the neighbors, who lives there, how many people? It is still an actual enumeration. It is not an estimate. The other constitutional provision to which you referred, the original clause, the respective numbers of the States, the Fourteenth Amendment in each State, I think both sides agree that what the framers are referring to are inhabitants. And the question is, is it rational to conclude, using the words of the first Census Act and the Census Clause, that servicemen abroad can still be considered as belonging to the respective numbers of their home States. I think the answer to that is clear. Madison knew what an inhabitant was. He was involved in drafting the Census Act, and he said it includes someone who is absent for a considerable period on public business, certainly an apt description of our troops abroad. It was tested in the case-of Minister Forsythe in 1824, our minister to Spain who was elected from Georgia to the House. His election was challenged. It said, you are not an inhabitant of Georgia. You have been in Spain, and the House said, his absence abroad on public business did not deprive him of the status of an inhabitant, and the same should be true of a private serving overseas in Korea. The review of both the constitutional claims and the administrative law claims is barred by the Census Act. The APA says that if a matter is committed to agency discretion by law, there is no review.","<speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is here from the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. That court ruled that the Secretary of Commerce could, consistent with the Constitution and the Census Act, include Federal personnel stationed abroad, primarily servicemen and servicewomen, in the State-by-State apportionment count on which the allocation of representatives is based. The court went on, however, to hold that the Secretary's method for doing so with respect to the 1990 census was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Secretary relied primarily on home of record data in Defense Department files, as had been done in 1970. Home of record is a serviceman's actual home at time of enlistment and it is where the military will return him when he is discharged. Based on--</text>",1991
16364,1991.91-1502-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","No, it has to be, as the statute says, a subsequent statute that has to be enacted. I was indicating the numerous exceptions to the usual residence rule. Six censuses, from 1870 to 1920, seafarers, not matter how long they were absent, counted at the land home. The military in 1900 counted at their family home even if stationed as the instruction said, at home or abroad. Members of Congress are counted at their home district, even though they live and sleep most of the time in the District of Columbia. From 1910 to 1940, the instructions said, if there is an American citizen in your family abroad, he should be counted at your family home, and it said, it does not matter how long the absence may continue. In other words, the usual residence concept cannot provide law to apply in considering this case, because this is a departure and modification of the usual residence rule, as has been historically done in a variety of circumstances including, of course, most prominently in 1970 when again, Federal personnel abroad were apportioned among the States based on home of record. Now turning to the merits, the district court concluded that the Secretary's decision to apportion the personnel overseas was not arbitrary and capricious in itself, and it was not. The record indicates the reasons for the Secretary's action. These personnel are away from home temporarily and involuntarily in the service of their country. They still consider themselves usual residents of the United States, although they are overseas. The Secretary noted the bipartisan congressional support for apportioning the overseas population, and in turn, that support noted these personnel vote in the United States, they pay taxes in the United States. Now, the Secretary did note in his decision memorandum that the Defense Department was going to undertake a survey, an actual survey of its personnel overseas, but contrary to the view of Massachusetts, that was not a condition of his decision. If the Court would look at the joint appendix on page 122, it spells out exactly what the condition is. This is the decision memorandum approved by the Secretary. It says: I recommend that you count them, provided that there is timely receipt of acceptable data from the Defense Department. Now, when the Defense Department cancelled its survey, that question became pertinent. Is there acceptable data that can be provided? And the Secretary determined that home of record, supplemented and improved, did provide acceptable data.","<speaker>John G.

16365,1991.91-1502-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","I don't think that undercuts our position. First of course, representations or statements of counsel are not part of the administrative record, and what needs to be reviewed is the administrative record. But secondly, all that the counsel was saying is that the Secretary had made a commitment. He had made a decision, the commitment referred to is simply the decision in the administrative record. Yes, we are going to apportion the overseas personnel if, if there is acceptable data. So the commitment that the counsel in the trial was referring to is no different than that in the decision memorandum in the record. Now, is home of record acceptable data? The Secretary, who has the discretion to conduct the census in the form and content he may determine, determined that it was. The technical staff of the Census Bureau said it comes closest to usual residence. It is the last place that a serviceman or woman chooses to reside. The Congressional Research Service, whose study was in the record, indicated that it is closest to a serviceman's own concept of his usual residence, an important point, since much of the census is self-selecting. Now, in the course of reaching that decision, concerns were raised about the data. This is not a sanitized, pre-cooked administrative record. It is not an administrative record at all in the usual sense of a discrete proceeding leading to a decision. It is part of the Census Bureau's business over the past years, but every one of the concerns that Massachusetts raises, every one of the concerns cited by the district court was addressed and answered in the record. Let's take them: First, the Department of Defense testified in 1989 that none of its data met a reasonable test of validity for apportionment purposes. Answer: joint appendix, page 161, the data will be supplemented and improved by methodologies devised by the technical experts who designed the overseas enumeration. Second, there was a gap in home of record. Up to 10 percent of servicemen did not have a home of record. Answer: joint appendix, page 158 and 162, the Defense Manpower Data Center would use its automated records to complete, fill in the gap, to the extent that it will be negligible. It went from 7 percent to 0.2 percent. The Census Bureau itself said that the data was of unknown reliability because it could be used to choose a low or no income tax State. Answer: joint appendix, page 151, it is legal residence that determines where you are taxed, not home of record. The Pentagon opined that last duty station would be closest to the concept of home of record. Answer: joint appendix, page 162, the Census Bureau disagreed. It noted, for example, if your last duty station was the Pentagon, you would show up as living in D.C., and you may have lived in Virginia or Maryland. And finally, the point that we hear most frequently, the Census Bureau itself said that it would be, quote, arbitrary, end quote, to rely on the Defense Department data to apportion Federal personnel overseas. Answer: joint appendix, page 210, that same study relying on legal opinions in 1949 and 1969 noted that the decision whether to include Federal personnel overseas was discretionary. So they were obviously not using arbitrary in an APA sense, but simply in the general sense that any categorical determination is arbitrary. Now the question is not... Massachusetts may not agree with these answers, but the question is not whether they were right or wrong. The question under this Court's precedence, assuming there is judicial review, is whether the relevant concerns were considered and if the Secretary committed a clear error of judgment. The record establishes that the concerns were addressed, were considered, and it seems clear that there was not a clear error of judgment in allocating the personnel overseas to their home of record. If there are no further questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.","<speaker>John G.

Petitioner attempts to create one by stringing epithets at the city's conduct in a worker's compensation case. Petitioner's argument is that if there is injury on one hand and a bad enough governmental entity on the other, and causation between the two, there is a constitutional violation. This has never been the law; this ought not be the law, because if it is, it is going to turn a tremendous amount of litigation into Federal constitutional law. Let me offer a hypothetical which I believe will help flesh out the facts of this case and the contours of what's available. The police department of Harker Heights is deliberately indifferent to the maintenance of its cars, just doesn't care about them. Police go out; they arrest a suspect. Driving the suspect back, the steering wheel jams, the police officer and the suspect are both killed. In our mind the suspect has a 1983 action. The police officer does not have 1983 action.

It is interesting to note that in the seventies and the eighties, now, when the State claims to have acted positively, the State action reduced black undergraduate enrollment by 14 percent and caused the number of degrees received by blacks to decrease by almost 400 from back... 1990... from that in 1981, according to... Government published report. Today, the college-going and degree-granting rates for blacks are on a downward trend, and this is due to discrimination. This, Your Honor, is the history Mississippi wants to walk away from. The historical discrimination to black... hurt black people in five different ways. Equal access... they were shut out. It segregated them, and then when they got in they got lesser programs, funding, facilities, reputation. And it denied black people leadership opportunities and employment opportunities in the five white schools, which were the schools of choice, so to speak. But now, if this case is dismissed, I want every... I don't say... if it's dismissed, but yet we show clearly in seven short pages in our reply brief that black people still are experiencing those harms, and the system of... rooted in the days of apartheid in Mississippi still exist. Nothing has changed. You have the misuse of the ACT. The university center dominated by xxx junior college, in addition to three white schools, still stands in the shadow of Jackson State University. You have black people still feeling hostility at the University of Mississippi, and basically the system is substantially intact from 1962 until now; 99 percent of the white students go to white schools. Now, the en banc court had an opportunity to deal with the constitutional... I mean, to not have this Court deal with the constitutional question. It relegated our title VI claim to a footnote, but to us this claim came first, it's independent, and I think it's dispositive on this record.</text>",1991

How does it apply to his companion, respondent Kesler?",<speaker>Paul S.

29137,1991.91-779-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas,Did you consider arguing that this venue statute violated the commerce clause?,"<speaker>Betty Jo Christian</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether Montana's venue law violates the equal protection clause. That venue law provides that a domestic corporation can be sued only in the county in which it has its principle place of business or in a case where a tort occurred within the State in the county where the tort occurred. The same venue law provides that suit can be filed against any foreign corporation in any of the 56 counties in the State. This rule applies even to a foreign corporation that has been licensed to do business, has named a registered agent, and has established a place of business in the State. Burlington Northern is this latter type of corporation, and the reason that we're before this Court today is that application of the Montana venue law has led to these suits and a number of others being filed in two particular counties in Montana in which suit would not be proper if the suit were against a domestic corporation. Now, I want to emphasize at the outset that petitioners are not asking this Court to determine what kind of venue law any State should prescribe. That is strictly a matter for the State, and they are entitled to make it as narrow or as broad as they choose. Our position is simply this: that a foreign corporation that has been admitted to do business in the State and has named its registered agent and established a place of business there is entitled to the protection of the same venue laws that the State chooses to adopt for its domestic incorporations.</text>",1991
29463,1991.90-1488-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Well, the discretion of how to enforce the requirements of the statute against the States, yes. The secretary may well decide that the resources are better used providing care even though the State is not complying and then taking other steps to ensure compliance. But no individual would have a right to sue the secretary, to compel the secretary to cut off funds to the State. The court below erred in this case in concluding that the reasonable efforts proviso was sufficiently specific and definite to create a right enforceable under section 1983. I think the issue is most clearly posed by asking the question, reasonable with respect to what? The statute provides no answer. This is not a case like Wilder where the statute provided for reasonable rates, but then went on at some length to specify what that meant: rates to meet the costs that must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated hospitals providing care in accordance with Federal and State law. This Court in Wilder said that that statutory language provided an objective benchmark against which to assess the reasonableness of rates. Here, the statute provides none.","<speaker>Christina M. Tchen</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case raises the question of whether the Federal Adoption Assistance Act and Child Welfare Act of 1980, specifically the provision commonly referred to as the reasonable efforts clause, creates rights that may be enforceable under 42 USC section 1983. The reasonable efforts clause states that in order to be eligible for Federal foster care reimbursement funds, that States must have a plan approved by the secretary that provides that in each case reasonable efforts will be made to keep or return a child home. The reasonable efforts clause does not provide any further definition or explanation of reasonable efforts. In light of that, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals below misapplied this Court's decision in Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association when it held that this clause was sufficiently specific and definite to create an enforceable right. The State of Illinois maintains that although the Adoption Assistance Act is mandatory and benefits the plaintiffs here, that it is simply too vague and amorphous to create a Federal right. This Court has stated that in order to create Federal rights upon the States, Congress must speak with a clear voice because of the values and concerns inherent in our system of Government, and that clear voice and clear statement is simply lacking here. One of the elements of determining whether a clear statement has been provided by Congress under section 1983 is whether the interest asserted by the plaintiffs is too vague and amorphous such that it is beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce. What the Seventh Circuit did here was to take this notion of competence of the judiciary in the abstract. It never looked at the statute at issue here and simply said, that because courts have proved competent to enforce a reasonableness terms in other statutes that have no relation to the statute at hand here, that therefore, courts are competent to enforce this particular reasonable efforts clause. But this reasonable efforts clause stands in stark contrast, for example, to the clause construed by this Court in Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association. In Wilder this Court held that the Boren amendment to the Medicaid act created a Federal right to reasonable and adequate Medicaid reimbursement rates, but it did so after a lengthy and extensive analysis of the statute at hand. And what this Court found was that the Boren amendment there set forth a lengthy list of specific factors, specific objective benchmarks defining what meant reasonable. There are no such benchmarks or factors here, and what we are left with is a reasonable efforts clause with no definition supplied by Congress that will subject the States to a substantive right to reasonable efforts that will be defined not by Congress but by individual judges applying their own notions of reasonableness.</text>",1991
29464,1991.90-1488-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","First of all, the Sherman Act specifically directs the courts to enforce the provision. There is no such direction to Federal courts in this case. Second of all, I think the Sherman Act does provide an objective benchmark: the standard of free market competition which the courts can use in applying those vague terms as well. In this case the regulations also don't answer the question, reasonable with respect to what? The case is therefore not like this Court's decision in Wright where the Court relied on regulations defining what was included in rent in holding that tenants could enforce a rent ceiling under section 1983.

The Federal courts... the respondents disclaim any such role for the Federal courts under section 1983. They are much more interested in defining on a systemic level in the abstract what constitutes reasonable efforts. The State courts look to the particular case, what the State has done for this child against... and balance that against the asserted need to remove the child from the home. Now the respondents may not agree with their amici on the source of the standards to apply in this case, but if it's not those standards, which standards? If the Federal courts are going to enforce a supposed right to reasonable efforts, the first thing they are going to have to do is set an objective benchmark against which to assess reasonableness, and that exercise involves policy judgments beyond the competence of the article 3 branch, not beyond their competence in the sense that judges would be incapable of coming up with an answer in any particular case, but beyond their competence in the sense that it moves the courts from adjudication of particular cases and controversies to the setting of social policy.","<speaker>Christina M.
