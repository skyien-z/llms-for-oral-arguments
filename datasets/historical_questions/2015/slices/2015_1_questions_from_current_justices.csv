So you -- we have two brothers and -- twin brothers, and they rob a bank. They get $10,000. They split it up, $5,000 each. And on that very same day, it happens to be their birthday, and their rich uncle comes and gives each of them $5,000 as a birthday present. So they go out to party, and one of them -- and they both spend $5,000 partying. One of them spends the money from the bank robbery. The other one spends the money that was given to them by their rich uncle. And your position is that the one who spent the money from the so-called ""tainted assets,"" the money from the bank robbery, is entitled to use the remaining $5,000 to hire an attorney, but the other one is out of luck?","<speaker>Howard Srebnick</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Sixth Amendment has always recognized the individual's right to spend his own money to obtain the advice and assistance of counsel.

Nor did that miscalculation prevent the Tribe from filing earlier. To the extent that there was uncertainty as to whether it was a member of the Cherokee Nation class, and whether presentment was a jurisdictional bar to that class membership, the prudent course, and any reasonably diligent litigant would have filed under the clear deadline, rather than wait for the uncertain application of tolling and the potential forfeiture of its claims.</text>",2015

One, why the record supports the Texas legislature's conclusion in 2009 that the holistic plan at issue was a necessary complement to the State's Top 10 Percent Law; two, why the record shows that Texas's holistic policy has had a meaningful impact on diversity at the University of Texas; and, three, why the record absolutely forecloses any claim that University of Texas has adopted a quota. With respect to the first question of necessity, there are three principle ways in which the record shows that the plan at issue was a necessary complement. First, as Justice Breyer mentioned, there is a significant portion of the admissions pool, all out-of-state students, all students from Texas high schools that don't rank, some of the best high schools in the State, and all students just below the top 10 percent who are nevertheless great students who aren't eligible for admission under the top 10 percent at all.

I've actually, with the help of the library, looked at cases in the Second and the Ninth Circuit for the last three years, and this is what I'm coming out with: In the Ninth Circuit, prevailing defendants have received fees 20 times and lost 17 times, about 50 percent. In the Second circuit, prevailing defendants have received fees three times and lost 16 times. That's a huge difference. If I look at what's happening with prevailing plaintiffs, in the Second Circuit, prevailing plaintiffs awarded fees 23 times, and prevailing plaintiffs denied fees seven. In the Ninth, prevailing plaintiffs got it 46 times and denied fees twice. Prevailing plaintiffs are winning everywhere in extraordinary numbers. And in both circuits, prevailing defendants are not winning hardly at all. At best, 50 percent in the Ninth Circuit.

The problem is those motives don't matter when what you have is an undermining of the fundamental principle of one-person, one-vote. So in this case, what we have is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, because by intentionally and systemically under-populating those minority ability-to-elect districts, the IRC violated Equal Protection Clause in that principle of one-person, one-vote.

Congress would just have said aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual abuse involving a minor or ward.
