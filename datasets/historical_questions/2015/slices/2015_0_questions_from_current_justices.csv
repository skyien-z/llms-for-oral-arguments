225,2015.14-1375-t01,petitioner,Sonia Sotomayor,What is the rule that you would like us to announce? When is it right to award prevailing defendants attorneys' fees?,"<speaker>Paul M. Smith</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: On the issue we initially asked this Court to resolve in the petition for certiorari, the parties are now in complete agreement. That issue, of course, was whether a prevailing defendant in a Title VII case is barred from seeking attorneys' fees if it hasn't prevailed on the merits. As we showed in our opening brief, such a rule, which exists only in the Eighth Circuit, makes little sense. It doesn't -- it is certainly not compelled by the statutory language and doesn't serve any rationing statutory policy to take away the power of work fees in a -- in a case of a non-merits disposition. The EEOC, having staunchly defended that rule in its brief in opposition, executed an about-face in its merits brief and now agrees with us that a non-merits disposition can be the basis of a defendant attorneys' fee award under Title VII. Now, for that reason and for all the reasons in our opening merits brief, which the government apparently found convincing, at least, we would suggest that the Court should reverse the Eighth Circuit's ruling and resolve the circuit conflict and rule that prevailing defendants can seek fees as long as they meet the Christiansburg standard, whether or not the disposition was on the merits.

There are three main reasons why Petitioner and the government are right about our interpretation of Section 523(a)(2)(A). The first is that this Court has said many times that when Congress uses a term that has an established common-law meaning, courts should give it that meaning when it's used in a statute. For centuries, the term ""fraud"" has been used at common law to refer to schemes that are in -- that -- that where property is transferred with the -- with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor. There is no reason to give that text any different meaning than in Section 523(a)(2)(a). The second is that our view is the only thing that -- the only interpretation that gives any meaning to the 1978 amendment.

But the second thing it does, in the fraudulent transfer context, specifically, is it sort of screens out the innocent recipient of a fraudulent transfer.

6481,2015.15-145-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor,Are you limiting actual frauds to just fraudulent conveyances? Are there other deceptive schemes that you would include?,"<speaker>Sarah E. Harrington</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court of Appeals erred in holding that Section 523(a)(2)(A) always requires proof of an intentional misrepresentation in order to prove actual fraud. There are three main reasons why Petitioner and the government are right about our interpretation of Section 523(a)(2)(A). The first is that this Court has said many times that when Congress uses a term that has an established common-law meaning, courts should give it that meaning when it's used in a statute. For centuries, the term ""fraud"" has been used at common law to refer to schemes that are in -- that -- that where property is transferred with the -- with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor. There is no reason to give that text any different meaning than in Section 523(a)(2)(a). The second is that our view is the only thing that -- the only interpretation that gives any meaning to the 1978 amendment. And the third is that our view is consistent with Congress's overarching purpose and the Bankruptcy Code, that -- that dishonors creditors -- excuse me -- dishonors debtors, not be permitted to use the Code to get rid of their debts. Now, Respondent offers a competing textual interpretation of the term -- of the phrase ""or actual fraud."" I think Petitioner has explained well why that interpretation doesn't make any sense as an -- as a grammatical matter. It also wouldn't give any effect to the 1978 amendment. Petitioner also relies on the -- on the word ""obtained,"" which Justice Breyer was referring to as well. Excuse me. Respondent does -- Respondent suggests that our interpretation doesn't give any meaning to the word ""obtained,"" if obtained doesn't mean that a false representation was directed at a creditor. But under our view, the word ""obtained"" actually does two things: The first thing it does is the work that this Court described it as doing in Cohen v. de la Cruz, which is it requires the causal connection between the fraudulent act and the debtor's acquisition of -- or possession of the property or money. But the second thing it does, in the fraudulent transfer context, specifically, is it sort of screens out the innocent recipient of a fraudulent transfer. And so if Congress had instead used the phrase ""obtained as a result of actual fraud,"" then argue -- arguably, that could have brought in an innocent recipient of a fraudulent transfer, because as a result, I would suggest that you focus on the transaction that caused the transfer of property. But ""obtained by"" really focuses on the action of the recipient. And so it really just gets at the recipient's mental state and -- and fraudulent activity.</text>",2015

If you had a judge that said, I don't think the evidence is up to snuff here, and then said, the thing that takes me over the line is what I think about the defendant's motive, and that's what allows me to say that the defendant is guilty, and that had not been proved, that had -- the State had never offered that into evidence.

But once you say, as I think you said, and I think you properly said, Look, if what the -- the judge's various comments on motive was basically taking him over the line, was -- that that was the basis for the verdict of guilty, that he didn't think that all the evidence, the other evidence was enough and that that was crucial to his finding, then, if I understand you right, you would say that's a due process violation because at that point the verdict of guilty is based on evidence that was never presented.","<speaker>Carolyn E.

They all skirted the real issue. Okay. So what was the real issue? What was the real issue? And then he says, the issue to me is that you have a drug dealer on a bike who Larry Owens, the defendant, knew was a drug dealer, and Owens wanted to knock him off. That's the real issue. And then he says, the State's evidence has proved that fact. What's that fact? Well, that fact is the same thing that he's just said is the real issue, that there was a drug dealer on the bike who knew -- and the defendant knew he was a drug dealer and wanted to knock him off.

This was an unusual prosecution. It was a murder prosecution where there was no evidence of motive. I think that's pretty rare. The judge may have been saying something like this: I have -- I have identification evidence here. And by the way, I -- I read the -- the whole -- everything -- the whole record and -- that's in the appendix and the closing argument of defense counsel. There was no -- the defense here was not that these were witnesses who made an honest mistake. They just didn't get a good opportunity to see the -- to see the perpetrator. The -- the -- argument of the defense, as I read it very clearly, was that something was going on here and these two witnesses were identifying -- were -- were falsely -- knowingly identifying the wrong person. Something was going on. There's evidence that the victim was selling drugs, very strong evidence that the victim was selling drugs, and that's what was going on here. And so the judge said -- may have said to himself, why does the -- the -- why would the accused take a baseball bat and beat this kid, this 17-year-old kid who has a lot of drugs in his pockets, riding around on a bike? Why would he just beat this kid to death? And there -- he -- I would be concerned about finding this -- the defendant guilty if I thought there was no motive in this case.

Let me set out how we see the interaction of the preemption framework and recordkeeping requirements, and then turn to what I think DOL's role is here. Both sides agree, essentially, that ERISA plans can be subject to some reporting requirements, probably many reporting requirements, incident to State laws in other substantive fields. So, for example, the Solicitor General gave the example of day care centers. ERISA plans can run day care centers. I don't think anyone doubts that you can have all sorts of reporting requirements to make sure the staff is trained, the facilities are safe. And so forth. This Court's case in De Buono upheld a tax imposed on employer contributions to an ERISA medical benefit plan that provided the medical benefits directly. And we told the Court at the time that that tax had all sorts of reporting requirements. So essentially, the question is here, where to draw the line between reporting requirements that are permissible and those that are nonpermissible. As I take Respondent's view, it's that they're -- it's certain information that is so core to the plan that you simply can't have State law reporting requirements about that information. I don't think that can be right. Take, for example, real property held in trust by a pension plan. DOL requires reporting on that. Obviously, you need to know the assets the pension plan has, but certainly a State taxing authority can require reporting about that same information to assess a property tax. The same was true with the tax in De Buono. The same is true, by the way, in Dillingham. That was a case about an ERISA-run apprentice program. And California law said, you either follow our standards for apprenticeship, or you have to pay a higher wage. I mean, that was as core as you get. It was literally the way the apprenticeship program was set up. So I don't think the test can be whether the information is, in some sense, core to ERISA. I think the test has to be, is this reporting requirement incident to a law in the field governed by ERISA, -- vesting, funding, fiduciary duties and so forth -- or is it incident to a law in health care, or in day care center regulation?

I think it was the Chief Justice who said that he didn't really understand. And I share his lack of understanding about how the BOP is actually doing this, given the language of the statute. The statute says, you know, ""shall forward payments each time the amount in the account exceeds $10."" So that suggests to me that if you're looking at an account with $10 and 1 cent, you make the next payment. And I understand from your brief that that's not what the BOP is doing.

I find the issue that's before us very difficult to resolve based on the statutory language. Is there any doctrine tantamount to the rule of lenity in interpreting a criminal statute that applies here? Because the thing that strikes me most is the extreme harshness of your position. We're talking about earning 23 cents an hour, filing fees of $350, $505. And the money is used to -- for what? Phone calls to family and friends, stamps for letters, and to buy books. And you're going to take the last, you know, whatever so that someone who's in there for 20 years can't even buy a book? That seems very, very harsh. And you seem to be willing to interpret the ambiguity in the statute to save the last $10, but you're unwilling to interpret what I think at least I regard as the ambiguity in the statute to allow prisoners -- I mean, they are prisoners.

The Federal court has exclusive jurisdiction if the suit is brought to enforce Exchange Act duties even if the suit is also brought to enforce State law duties. In particular, the words ""brought to enforce"" focus on what the plaintiff itself wants the court to decide, not on what the court would necessarily have to decide, as 1331 has been read to require. By applying the 1331 test, the Third Circuit not only ignored Section 27's distinct language but also its distinct policies, which strongly disfavor State court adjudication of Exchange Act duties and thus are exactly the opposite of the policies favoring State court adjudication that underlie the Jackson Pollock canvas this Court has painted over Section 1331. Respondents, however, begin not with the necessity rule derived from 1331 but with a much more aggressive position that Section 27 only creates jurisdiction over causes of action created by the Exchange Act itself and thus categorically bars jurisdiction over State-based causes of action like those asserted here.</text>",2015

And so the framework this Court developed was to distinguish between equitable relief on the one hand and things like damages that, clearly, Congress didn't mean to include in the relief that would be available.

And so I think the way that the Court rules in this case is not going to affect the existence of those incentives on the part of beneficiaries or the need for plans to be diligent.
