20009,1998.98-84-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Directly or through, a reference to the holding in Grove City that you can be an indirect recipient. But the test is still the same. Whether indirect or direct, are you the intended recipient? What the Court said in Paralyzed Veterans is to find the recipient, you have to look to the--","<speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is here from the Third Circuit which held that the NCAA would be covered by title IX if it received dues from member institutions which receive Federal financial assistance. That decision is wrong and should be reversed. It's wrong because Court has held that for an entity to be covered by title IX, or any of the other statutes with the same Federal funding trigger, the entity must itself be a recipient of Federal financial assistance. The Court said just that in the Paralyzed Veterans case. Quote, Congress limited the scope of the law to those who actually receive Federal financial assistance. End quote. Later in the same opinion, the Court said that these laws, quoting again, require us to identify the recipient of the Federal assistance. And it also explained why that is so.</text>",1998
20010,1998.98-84-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","--And what happened is the district court said on this motion to dismiss, we have to test and see what the standards are to establish that someone is an indirect recipient. What... what do you have in mind? What are you talking about--","<speaker>Edwin S. Kneedler</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Third Circuit decided this case, at least as petitioner understands it, on a theory that someone in the position of the NCAA can be subject to suit under title IX solely on the ground that it is a mere beneficiary of the program and on that ground alone. We agree with petitioner that that reading... if that is what the Third Circuit meant to hold, that that is incorrect, and that that is inconsistent with the decision in Paralyzed Veterans. All that this Court needs to decide is that that particular theory was incorrect and it could remand for consideration of alternative theories. For example, the petition in this case presents the question on the assumption that petitioner is not a recipient, but is... does its receipt of payments... does the receipt of payments by a non-recipient essentially on the benefit theory subject it to liability? The question... the question of, however, of whether the NCAA is a recipient, either because the colleges operate programs and pay dues which pass on some of the Federal financial assistance, or alternatively, because of the Health and Human Services grant that is... that is made to the National Youth Sports Program, operated and administered according to the NCAA's own constitution by a committee of the NCAA, whether either of those theories of being a recipient subjects it to coverage is not, I think, within the question presented and could properly be considered on remand. The other question of whether the NCAA is subject to suit under title IX, because it has been ceded controlling authority over the operation of the program in certain particulars, was I think fairly raised in the court of appeals on pages 5, 9, and 22 of the respondent's brief, but that too was not addressed by the court of appeals and could be considered on remand. I think it's important, though, in leaving these questions open for the court of appeals, for this Court not to rule out the possibility or not to foreclose as a matter of law any of these various theories because this case is at a very preliminary stage, and the court... the district court--</text>",1998

Smith</speaker><text>No, Your Honor. I'm sorry. No, Mr. Chief Justice. I think they would be distorted explanations of what the Authority has held in a number of cases. It is true, in point of fact, that unions have come forward and attempted to expand on the basic Weingarten right and to bargain for matters over and above the basic right to have a union representative present during an investigation. And it is true, in some of the examples you cite, the Authority might have held certain proposals to be negotiable. What they failed to cite in their brief is when the Authority makes such a ruling, if we are deemed to be overbroad in our interpretation of what the right under section 7114 (a)(2)(B) includes, we're subjected to judicial review and have, in some of those cases, been corrected by the courts of appeal on review.</text>",1998

24119,1998.98-369-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas,"Well, there's a separate Inspector Generals act for the smaller agencies.

24120,1998.98-369-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas,"The point was, I don't think you can have it both ways. You can't say that the Inspector General is under the agency head when we know that the purpose was to do just the opposite and to get the investigations from under the agency heads. And let me ask you this question. Do you agree that in the old days that the head of the agency could actually direct the auditor's investigation of these matters?","<speaker>David M.
