The jury returned a verdict on fair use, and Oracle moved for judgment as a matter of law. Why wasn't the Federal Circuit required to apply the Rule 50 standard and ask whether the evidence presented at trial viewed in the light most favorable to Google would have been sufficient as a matter of law to support the jury's fair use verdict?","<speaker>E. Joshua Rosenkranz</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Google's whole argument this morning is code is different. Now a few basic legal principles and concessions control the outcome of this case. Legal principle 1: Congress defined literary work to include software and granted copyright protection as long as the code is original. Google conceded Oracle's code is original. That's the end of the question. Google asks this Court to carve out declaring code, but Congress rejected the very carveout in multiple ways, including in its definition of computer program and by not including Google's carveout among the limitations in Section 117. Legal principle 2: This Court held in Harper and in Stewart that a superseding use is always unfair as a matter of law. No court has found fair use or upheld a fair use verdict where a copyist copied so much valuable expression into a competing commercial sequel to mean the same thing and serve the same purpose as the original. Google conceded the purpose and the meaning are the same. That's the end of Question 2. No one else thought that innovating required copying Sun's code without a license. As Justice Alito notes, Apple and Microsoft did not copy to create their competing platforms. Neither did others who wrote competing platforms in the Java language. There was and still is a huge market for declaring code. Other major companies, like IBM and SAP, were paying a lot of money to license just the Sun declaring code precisely because it was created. And throughout this litigation, Google never denied this. If this Court holds that a jury may conclude that copying declaring code is fair, it will encourage copying, create legal uncertainty, and decimate the business model which a lot of companies depend on, undermining the very incentives copyright was designed to promote.</text>",2020

26035,2020.18-956-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, at the -- in your beginning statement, you had the sky falling if we ruled in favor of Google. The problem with that argument for me is that it seems that since 1992, and Justice Kagan mentioned the case, the Second Circuit case, a Ninth Circuit case, an Eleventh Circuit case, a First Circuit case, that a basic principle has developed in the case law, up until the Federal Circuit's decision. I know there was a Third Circuit decision earlier on in the 1980s. But the other circuits moved away from that. They and the entire computer world have not tried to analogize computer codes to other methods of expression because it's sui generis. They've looked at its functions, and they've said the API, the Application Programming Interface, of which the declaring code is a part, is not copyrightable. Implementing codes are. And on that understanding, industries have built up around applications that know they can -- they can copy only what's necessary to run on the application, but they have to change everything else. That's what Google did here. That's why it took less than 1 percent of the Java code. So I guess that's the way the world has run in every other system. Whether it's Apple's desktop or Amazon's web services, everybody knows that APIs are not -- declaring codes are not copyrightable. Implementing codes are. So please explain to me why we should now upend what the industry has viewed as the copyrightable elements and has declared that some are methods of operation and some are expressions. Why should we change that understanding?","<speaker>E.

26036,2020.18-956-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Rosenkranz, as -- as I understand it, there are two features of your declaring code that you think merit copyright. And I want to make sure I'm -- I'm -- I'm right on this first. The -- the first feature, and this is pretty basic, is that we need some way of connecting a programmer's inputs, whatever they happen to be, some way of connecting those inputs to implementing code. And then the second feature is that there needs to be a way to organize those inputs, those calls, into various classes and packages. So one is like the trigger and one is the method of organization.

I'll give you an example that's similar to one that the Chief Justice used, but I think you won't be -- you won't be able to answer in quite the same way. Suppose I own a grocery store and I come up with a really terrific way of organizing all my fresh produce, all my fruits and vegetables, into these categories and sub-categories, very intuitive for the shopper.

26043,2020.18-956-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas,"Thank you, Chief Justice. Mr. Stewart, a couple of quick questions. One, do you think the Federal Circuit applied the proper review standard?","<speaker>Thomas C. Goldstein</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The merger doctrine resolved the copyrightability question in this case. Oracle has a copyright to the computer code in Java SE but not a patent. That means that the public, not Oracle, has the right to Java SE's function, and Oracle cannot leverage its copyright to create patent-like rights. Specifically, under the merger doctrine, there is no copyright protection for computer code that is the only way to perform those functions. Here, Java software developers have the right to use certain commands to create applications for Google's Android smartphone platform, but, to work, the commands require Google to reuse an exact set of declarations from Java SE, like a key that fits into a lock. Because there are no substitutes, Oracle is impermissibly claiming the exclusive right not merely to what the declarations say but also to what the declarations do. That is not a copyright; it is a patent right. With respect to fair use, the long-settled practice of reusing software interfaces is critical to modern interoperable computer software. Here, reusing the minimally creative declarations allowed the developers to write millions of creative applications that are used by more than a billion people. But those policy questions are almost academic because the issue is not whether this Court would find fair use. The standard of review asks the much narrower question whether the jury could reasonably find fair use. Oracle now obviously regrets its demand that the jury weigh all the evidence and decide fair use in a general verdict that contains no subsidiary findings. No previous court ever held that only a court may decide fair use. It is so fact-bound that no prior appellate court ever overturned a fair use verdict. This uniquely contested case should not be the first. Today, you will hear three lawyers present legal arguments for an hour. In 2016, the jury heard the starkly conflicting testimony of almost 30 witnesses and reviewed roughly 200 exhibits over two-and-a-half weeks.

Now let's assume, for the purposes of my question, that this is copyrightable, which it might be or it might not be. But let's assume it is and -- and go to the fair use question. When -- when a -- a -- a -- a cell phone, a smartphone manufacturer takes that layout, takes that keyboard, and uses it for its next phone, is that fair use and why or why not?","<speaker>Thomas C. Goldstein</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The merger doctrine resolved the copyrightability question in this case. Oracle has a copyright to the computer code in Java SE but not a patent. That means that the public, not Oracle, has the right to Java SE's function, and Oracle cannot leverage its copyright to create patent-like rights. Specifically, under the merger doctrine, there is no copyright protection for computer code that is the only way to perform those functions. Here, Java software developers have the right to use certain commands to create applications for Google's Android smartphone platform, but, to work, the commands require Google to reuse an exact set of declarations from Java SE, like a key that fits into a lock. Because there are no substitutes, Oracle is impermissibly claiming the exclusive right not merely to what the declarations say but also to what the declarations do. That is not a copyright; it is a patent right. With respect to fair use, the long-settled practice of reusing software interfaces is critical to modern interoperable computer software. Here, reusing the minimally creative declarations allowed the developers to write millions of creative applications that are used by more than a billion people. But those policy questions are almost academic because the issue is not whether this Court would find fair use. The standard of review asks the much narrower question whether the jury could reasonably find fair use. Oracle now obviously regrets its demand that the jury weigh all the evidence and decide fair use in a general verdict that contains no subsidiary findings. No previous court ever held that only a court may decide fair use. It is so fact-bound that no prior appellate court ever overturned a fair use verdict. This uniquely contested case should not be the first. Today, you will hear three lawyers present legal arguments for an hour.

Joshua Rosenkranz</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Google's whole argument this morning is code is different.

Legal principle 1: Congress defined literary work to include software and granted copyright protection as long as the code is original. Google conceded Oracle's code is original. That's the end of the question. Google asks this Court to carve out declaring code, but Congress rejected the very carveout in multiple ways, including in its definition of computer program and by not including Google's carveout among the limitations in Section 117. Legal principle 2: This Court held in Harper and in Stewart that a superseding use is always unfair as a matter of law. No court has found fair use or upheld a fair use verdict where a copyist copied so much valuable expression into a competing commercial sequel to mean the same thing and serve the same purpose as the original. Google conceded the purpose and the meaning are the same. That's the end of Question 2. No one else thought that innovating required copying Sun's code without a license. As Justice Alito notes, Apple and Microsoft did not copy to create their competing platforms. Neither did others who wrote competing platforms in the Java language. There was and still is a huge market for declaring code. Other major companies, like IBM and SAP, were paying a lot of money to license just the Sun declaring code precisely because it was created.

Underwood</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Constitution and laws require the seats in the House be apportioned according to the number of persons in each state. The President's new policy of refusing to count people who are not in a lawful immigration status is flatly inconsistent with that command. Our laws reflect a deliberate choice not to base apportionment on citizenship, voter eligibility, or any other legal status but instead to count the number of people living in a state. That has always included people who are ineligible to vote, including non-citizens, and it has also included people who were present in violation of law. The memorandum treats counting people as a reward to be withheld from states that house undocumented immigrants. But our law views counting people for apportionment as finding fact, not giving and withholding rewards. The memorandum pretends that if under the law a person should not be here, then the person is not here. The government can do many things to induce undocumented immigrants to leave, but it cannot declare them to be gone when, in fact, they're here and likely to remain. My friend says the policy must be upheld because some undocumented immigrants could be excluded from the count. Whether they could is disputed, but, in any case, that would not support this policy, which applies to all undocumented immigrants and refuses to count them solely on the basis of undocumented status. As this Court recognized in Shelby County, an unlawful policy can't be saved by the possibility that a lawful policy could be written. The question here is whether a blanket policy of not counting undocumented immigrants is lawful, and it's not because undocumented status alone doesn't tell us where a person usually resides. This policy ignores the undisputed fact that millions of undocumented immigrants have lived here for decades and have substantial community ties. Their undocumented status doesn't erase their presence.</text>",2020

You -- the government has tons of records on tons of people. I mean, we're not just talking about ICE detainees. By the time you think about DACA recipients and people in removal proceedings and a number of other categories, you easily get over 4 million people. But General Wall says that that's not the problem. The problem is a matching problem. And, essentially, the -- the Department has not yet sort of gone through this process of trying to match those numbers with the answers to the census questionnaire. Now I don't really quite understand how that process works, so I'm wondering, if you do, if you can tell me whether you think it's credible that they, the Census Bureau, at this point would not know approximately how many people they'll be able to exclude of all the people that they have administrative records on. And I guess the second question would be, is that what we should be focused on, or is that an unimportant question?","<speaker>Barbara D. Underwood</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Constitution and laws require the seats in the House be apportioned according to the number of persons in each state. The President's new policy of refusing to count people who are not in a lawful immigration status is flatly inconsistent with that command. Our laws reflect a deliberate choice not to base apportionment on citizenship, voter eligibility, or any other legal status but instead to count the number of people living in a state. That has always included people who are ineligible to vote, including non-citizens, and it has also included people who were present in violation of law. The memorandum treats counting people as a reward to be withheld from states that house undocumented immigrants. But our law views counting people for apportionment as finding fact, not giving and withholding rewards. The memorandum pretends that if under the law a person should not be here, then the person is not here.

First, I want to make one point in response to something General Underwood said, and I'm hope -- hoping the Solicitor General can address this on reply, about the declaratory judgment after apportionment, who that would be addressed to and how that would work. That's something that I would appreciate more from the Solicitor General on but not going to be able to ask at that point. As to -- as to you, I want to ask you about your point that we should rule now because the memo expresses the intent to exclude non-citizens who are here unlawfully to the maximum extent under law, is what you said, and you quoted that a couple times.

But such serious breaches of trust by insiders are precisely what the statutory language is designed to cover. If a statute prohibited accessing a warehouse with authorization -- with -- with authorization and using such access to obtain items in the warehouse that the accessor is not entitled so to obtain, everyone would understand that language to cover an employee who's allowed to take items for work who instead takes them for himself. Section 1030 used the same language to extend the same property-based protection to the private computer records that contain our most sensitive financial, medical, and other data. Petitioner's trying to gut the statute and leave all of that data at the mercy of anyone who ever has any legitimate ground to see it under any circumstance. But, in doing that, he fails to give effect to every word of the statute, as his answer to Justice Kagan showed, and he ignores its clear history and design, as his answer to Justice Breyer showed. He's -- what he's -- what he's instead relying on here is a wild caricature of our position that tries to bury his own heartland statutory violation beneath an imaginary avalanche of hypothetical prosecutions that he can't actually identify in the real world for seemingly innocent conduct.

Plaintiffs say this case can't be dismissed only because they sued sovereign defendants under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. But, for three reasons, that can't be right. First, the FSIA's plain text tells us that it concerns only sovereign immunity from jurisdiction. It has no effect on non-jurisdictional prudential doctrines like comity-based abstention. Second, the FSIA says that when sovereign defendants lack sovereign immunity, they should be treated the same as private defendants, not worse than private defendants. And, finally, the FSIA undisputedly leaves in place other prudential grounds for declining jurisdiction, like forum non conveniens, and there is no textual or other basis to treat comity any differently.</text>",2020

In part for reasons others have expressed, that would not be predictable. It would be hard for courts to do that, wouldn't necessarily be equitable, given the number of courts who would be involved hearing similarly situated plaintiffs. Rather, I viewed the doctrine at least as it's been articulated as reflecting a general foreign policy concern, and then the question becomes the particulars of the doctrine. And I had understood the argument to be that, if foreign defendants harm foreign parties in a foreign country and remedies are available in the foreign country, then American courts should usually abstain.

Delaware has used that freedom to create a system unique among the states of constitutionally-mandated political balance for its judiciary, with the result that Delaware's courts are widely regarded as the least partisan and most professional in the nation. The Third Circuit has upended that system based on an implausible reading of this Court's political patronage cases. Elrod and Branti expressly permit using political affiliation for appointments to high-level discretionary positions. But even if we're wrong about that, the Delaware provisions serve a compelling interest in creating a uniquely balanced and nonpartisan judiciary. Now, to make matters worse, the Third Circuit invalidated the bare majority provision based solely on severability, despite having found that Mr. Adams has no standing to challenge that requirement. That analysis directly conflicts with both federal and state severability doctrines. There is no doubt whatsoever that the bare majority requirement can stand on its own. It stood on its own for more than 50 years, from 1897 to 1951. It stands on its own with respect to two of Delaware's five constitutional courts even today. There is not the slightest reason to believe that Delaware's constitutional drafters would eliminate the bare majority requirement if they knew the major party provision would be struck down. That said, both provisions of the Delaware constitution pass muster under the First Amendment.

29930,2020.19-309-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, your last answer troubles me because there are three rights at issue here that I see, at least three. It's your right, your client's right as an Independent to seek judicial appointment, and that right is being limited by this majority party rule. Then there's the governor's right under Elrod and Branti to decide who he wants to appoint to a certain position, and he could, maybe not this governor, but another governor might want an Independent or another third-party applicant, but the constitution stops him from doing that. And that's where I think Elrod and Branti would have quite a -- a lot to say about whether or not your political affiliations have much to do with your decision-making. And -- and that, I think, would be what we would have to face given Justice Alito's question, a governor who says, I won't appoint somebody from another party under any circumstance. But that's not the case here. The case here involves the State, and it's the State's choice for its own interests balancing partisanship and promoting an independent judiciary who says, I want to prohibit both your client and the State and the governor from acting in a particular way, i.e. from selecting you merely because you're an Independent. And it seems to me that the bare majority rule, that or prohibition in this case, is more than adequate to take care of those two interests, but the majority party rule doesn't -- isn't.

30122,2020.19-930-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Mr. -- Mr. Bond, I think Direct Marketing is a -- a real problem for you, except you have one big answer to it, which is that that -- that case -- that case did not involve a tax penalty and this one does. So I'm curious about how much weight you think that can -- can hold. If -- if Congress passed a law saying that there's a one dollar tax penalty for the violation of any IRS regulation, does that mean that there would be no pre-enforcement review at all for any tax regulation?","<speaker>Jonathan C. Bond</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At the heart of this case are two code provisions that are unambiguous and a third whose scope is disputed. The first clear provision is the Anti-Injunction Act, which bars a suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax. That text and this Court's decisions make clear that a suit cannot proceed if the relief it seeks would legally bar the IRS from collecting a tax, regardless of the plaintiff's objective or motive for bringing suit, as I understand Petitioner now to acknowledge. The second unambiguous provision is 6671, which provides that penalties imposed in subchapter 68(b) are treated as taxes. And by far, the most important consequence of that provision is that 68(b) penalties are subject to the AIA, which precludes pre-enforcement review and instead channels disputes to refund suits. Together, those two provisions resolve this case because Petitioner's complaint on its face at page 16 seeks to enjoin the enforcement of reporting requirements that are enforced by 68(b) penalties. Petitioner leans heavily on a third provision, Section 7203, which makes certain willful violations a misdemeanor and which it says requires committing a crime to obtain judicial review. But Petitioner misreads that provision, which does not criminalize the very avenue of review this Court commended 93 years ago in Sullivan and has reaffirmed since, of filing a timely return that asserts a good faith objection to reporting certain information in order to obtain review. Petitioner can do that by incurring the penalty, paying it, and suing for a refund. But even if 7203's application were ambiguous, the way to harmonize all three provisions is to hold that Congress meant what it said unambiguously in 6671 and the AIA, that these penalties are treated as taxes that must be litigated in refund suits, and resolve any lingering dispute about ""willfully"" to preserve Congress's choice.

The first clear provision is the Anti-Injunction Act, which bars a suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax. That text and this Court's decisions make clear that a suit cannot proceed if the relief it seeks would legally bar the IRS from collecting a tax, regardless of the plaintiff's objective or motive for bringing suit, as I understand Petitioner now to acknowledge. The second unambiguous provision is 6671, which provides that penalties imposed in subchapter 68(b) are treated as taxes. And by far, the most important consequence of that provision is that 68(b) penalties are subject to the AIA, which precludes pre-enforcement review and instead channels disputes to refund suits. Together, those two provisions resolve this case because Petitioner's complaint on its face at page 16 seeks to enjoin the enforcement of reporting requirements that are enforced by 68(b) penalties. Petitioner leans heavily on a third provision, Section 7203, which makes certain willful violations a misdemeanor and which it says requires committing a crime to obtain judicial review. But Petitioner misreads that provision, which does not criminalize the very avenue of review this Court commended 93 years ago in Sullivan and has reaffirmed since, of filing a timely return that asserts a good faith objection to reporting certain information in order to obtain review. Petitioner can do that by incurring the penalty, paying it, and suing for a refund. But even if 7203's application were ambiguous, the way to harmonize all three provisions is to hold that Congress meant what it said unambiguously in 6671 and the AIA, that these penalties are treated as taxes that must be litigated in refund suits, and resolve any lingering dispute about ""willfully"" to preserve Congress's choice.

30141,2020.19-930-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"Thank you. And good afternoon, Mr. Bond. I'm going to tell you where I'm -- I think I'm with you and where I think I have a problem. On the text of the Anti-Injunction Act, I think you have a strong argument, Subchapter 68 and how that fits here. This penalty is designated a tax; therefore, it fits within the AIA. Direct Marketing, I think you have a good point. That was not subject -- that penalty was not denominated a tax and, therefore, the reason the two cases would be different is that the text of the statutes is different. You make a good point there, I think. In terms of the Regan point, how you would do this, you say you file a letter objecting to it, and you then have post- -- you have proceedings after the IRS assesses the penalty. That all makes sense to me as well. The criminal point, Justice Alito's point, you just said the Court could flat-out say that it's not a willful violation when you're challenging the reporting requirement being unlawful. So that -- we could -- we could say that. Here's where I think I have a concern: On Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander, those cases, you were having a discussion with Justice Kagan, either/or, are you challenging the regulatory aspect of this or the reporting aspect of this, or are you challenging the tax aspect? I think you're challenging both as a plaintiff really. And what Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander seem to say -- and this supports you -- is that when you're doing that, you have to go -- the AIA applies. And I -- I agree with you that those cases support you. But I also think Justice Gorsuch makes a very good point that the current philosophy that's -- those cases are from a different era. The current philosophy of challenging administrative action is different, as the Chief Justice said, with presumptions. And, here, where I really think Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander may be different is when the penalties are so high if you lose. In other words, you have to bet, and if you bet and lose, penalties are so high that it's going to deter you from challenging the regulatory or reporting aspect in the first place. So the bottom -- long-wind up, bottom-line question. Shouldn't -- as a matter of fairness, modern era of administrative law, presumptions, shouldn't we carve out an exception from Bob Jones, Alexander, Bailey, when the penalties for trying to challenge something are so high that it's going to be coercive and effectively deter you from bringing this kind of challenge in the first place?","<speaker>Jonathan C.

In rejecting Ms. Torres's claim that the shooting violated the Fourth Amendment, the court of appeals did not consider whether Respondents' use of deadly force was reasonable. By the court's reasoning, Respondents could have shot Ms. Torres without any provocation and it would not have violated the Fourth Amendment because, instead of remaining in the parking lot, she drove herself to the hospital.

In Hodari D., the Court unanimously recognized that when a government officer inflicts physical force on a person with the intent to restrain them, that person is seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, regardless of whether that restraint is successful.

As Hodari D. explains, this is because the Fourth Amendment must protect today what it protected when it was adopted, and in determining what the Fourth Amendment protected at the founding, this Court has always looked at the common law definitions of search and seizure, and with respect to seizures of persons, the common law of arrest. The Court explained in Atwater that an examination of the common law of arrest tells us what the founding generation would have understood to be an unreasonable seizure of a person. The common law of arrest leaves no doubt that when Respondents' bullets entered Ms. Torres's back, she was seized within the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Several centuries' worth of cases and commentary, both before and after the founding, uniformly recognize that physical force intended to restrain is an arrest even if the subject evades capture.</text>",2020

On paper, it restored the full breadth of the Sixth Amendment's jury trial right to Louisianans. But we need to place the effect of this ruling into perspective. This laudable ruling would only apply to cases then pending or recently adjudicated. It meant nothing to Mr. Edwards, who is serving a life sentence at Angola for a verdict that would be illegal everywhere else, as Louisiana is the only place that would jail you for natural life on a nonunanimous verdict. Ultimately, the question before the Court is, why should the Sixth Amendment mean something less to Mr. Edwards? Members of the Ramos Court were divided on how to reconcile the fractured decision in Apodaca with then existing precedents. This division cleared two paths to holding that Ramos applies retroactively under Teague, two paths for providing a remedy to those jailed by a jury scheme we know was morally wrong at its inception and is unconstitutional. For some justices, Apodaca was dead on arrival since its deciding votes rationale was foreclosed by precedent. For these justices, Apodaca provided no precedential value and Ramos is an old rule dictated by precedent -- precedents that simply restored the Sixth Amendment's full measure either through the Due Process Clause or the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. For other justices, Apodaca was such a wrongly decided decision that it needed to be explicitly overruled.

Maintaining that distinct character is both procompetitive, because it differentiates the NCAA's product from professional sports, and can be achieved only through agreement. The lower courts agreed that the NCAA's conception of amateurism is procompetitive, but, in striking down several of the rules, they made two fundamental errors. First, they defined their own ""much narrower"" conception of amateurism to mean only that athletes not be paid unlimited amounts unrelated to education. And they then imposed a regime that permits athletes to be paid thousands of dollars each year just for playing on a team and unlimited cash for ""post-eligibility internships."" That manifestly preserves neither the NCAA's demarcation between college and professional sports, nor even the lower courts', because whatever their labels, these new allowances are akin to professional salaries, especially given the truly unique history here. A rule that is reasonably designed to preserve amateurism as the NCAA has defined it should be upheld. Ruse -- rules that do not enforce the amateur status of athletes, by contrast, may be subject to detailed scrutiny.

Normally, in joint venture law, this Court has come to recognize that we shouldn't be flyspecking individual aspects of covenants not to compete amongst joint venture participants because they're creating a new product that wouldn't otherwise be available in a market and that the rule of reason should be pretty light and that plaintiff bears a heavy burden to show that a covenant not to compete violates the Sherman Act. This case, the -- the Ninth Circuit, the district court, applied a pretty searching inquiry on covenants, each and individual aspect of them.

Everyone here is eligible and registered to vote. All they have to do is utilize the myriad opportunities that Arizona's offered them over 27 days to vote by mail for free or in person. And since there's no denial of opportunity, this is a disparate impact claim that would not even be cognizable in other contexts.

No one's ever brought a Title VII claim saying you can't require people to send in applications because minorities have less access to transportation and mail, analogous to the claim being made here.

She says in response to your argument that we have to look at the process itself to say, overall, is the process, you know, open enough for disadvantaged voters. So, you know, even if they can't send their ballot in via ballot collection, they have many other opportunities to do so, early voting, et cetera. She points out in Footnote 6 on page 23 that if a state sends unsolicited ballot applications to residents of white neighborhoods but not to residents of black neighborhoods, that would amount to giving the latter less opportunity to participate. And she's, you know, quoting the Republican party there. Wouldn't that be true even if black voters could vote in other ways?

He even said, you know, it would be laughable not to look at demographic realities on occasion. And I bring you back to this hypothetical question where black voters have many fewer polling stations, even though that's a completely neutral rule on its face, but the way it operates is to make voting more difficult for black voters than white voters and leave it so that they -- the political system is not equally open to their participation. And he said, sure, you can -- you can look at that. And, similarly, you talked about, like, the practical evaluation of realities on the ground. So, I mean, tell me how you think these things differ. And I guess, more specifically -- I guess, when you start thinking about a whole run of hypotheticals, there are some things that are really quite obvious burdens which you just know looking at them is going to lead to -- to real difficulty for some -- you know, to black -- for black voters or for Native American voters or for Latino voters, and then other restrictions where you can say, well, you know, that's kind of an inconvenience, but they could -- they could overcome that inconvenience if -- if they really wanted to.

Everyone here is eligible and registered to vote. All they have to do is utilize the myriad opportunities that Arizona's offered them over 27 days to vote by mail for free or in person.

31397,2020.19-1257-t01,petitioner,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Ms. Amunson. I want to explore how we got here as a statutory matter and try to square up the statutory text and common sense a bit. It seems like there are two polar positions one could have reading different parts of the statute. So Section 2(a) speaks only of results. That was the House bill, of course. And that strongly supports a position that any disproportionate impact would be problematic under the statute. Of course, the Dole compromise meant that Section 2(b) was added to the statute, and that speaks of opportunity. And a polar position on that would be, as was suggested in Mr. Carvin's brief, that time, place, and manner restrictions that are race-neutral provide equal opportunity. But, as Justice Kagan pointed out, just -- Mr. Carvin alluded to demographic realities being relevant, the state attorney general also talked about the totality of the circumstances being relevant, and, of course, in Section 2(b) -- refers to the totality of the circumstances. So, to the extent we're not at either polar position, we're between pure results and pure opportunity, as defined in -- in Mr. Carvin's brief at least, and we're in totality of the circumstances, two -- two circumstances that seem to make a difference as a matter of common sense. One, as the Chief Justice pointed out, when you have the Carter-Baker Commission saying that a particular state law is a good idea as a matter of policy, that would seem to be a circumstance that is -- as a matter of common sense, would -- would lend support to the state's rule. And then, secondly, and I mentioned this earlier, when a state rule is commonplace in other states, that would seem to be a circumstance that puts a thumb on the scale in favor of the legitimacy of the state rule and it not being a reflection of discriminatory intent. And, here, the out-of-precinct policy is in something like 26 other states, including a wide variety of states, including states with no history of discrimination. So, if we get into totality of the circumstances, why don't those two things matter? And you can comment more generally on how I've outlined this.","<speaker>Michael A.

So, Ms. Amunson, I want to ask you a question about the degree of, say, inconvenience versus burden, because one of the difficulties in this case is that, you know, the attorney general says that the burden has to be substantial, Mr. Carvin's talking about the ordinary burdens of voting. And there's a difficulty that, you know, the statutory language and its lack of clarity presents in trying to figure out when something crosses from an inconvenience to a burden. You know, on the other side -- and I think some of the hypotheticals that Justice Alito was asking you emphasized this -- I think, you know, your position and its emphasis on any disparity at all risks saying that any election rule, you know, which, as Judge Easterbrook pointed out in his Frank opinion, you know, all election rules are going to make it easier for some to vote than others. So your approach risks ruling them all out. So let me give you an example. What about a rule that the polls close at 7 p.m. and because of socioeconomic reasons, it's harder for minority voters to get to the poll spot before 7 p.m. because of the time, you know, of their work hours in the day? Is that the kind of burden that triggers Section 2? Would that -- would such a rule -- poll closure rule, would that violate Section 2?","<speaker>Michael A.

Thompson</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: An access easement that takes the right to enter, occupy, and use another's private property effects a per se physical taking under the Fifth Amendment.

The access regulation at issue in this case authorizes an easement on the property of Petitioners for the benefit of union organizers. Under the terms of the Access Regulation, organizers may occupy the businesses' property for three hours each day, 120 days each year. This Court should hold that the taking of this easement violates the Fifth Amendment because it effects a physical taking without compensation, and the Court should so hold for two reasons. First, the appropriation of a real property interest triggers a categorical duty to compensate. The Access Regulation authorizes the taking of a real property interest in the form of a continual right to occupy and use Petitioners' property. And, second, at a more fundamental level, the Access Regulation denies Petitioners the right to exclude union organizers from their property. Such an infringement on the most fundamental property right merits per se treatment. The Ninth Circuit, however, took a different tack. It demoted the right to exclude to just another stick in the bundle and would give per se treatment only to those rare easements that authorize 24/7 occupation. Not even the Board supports that extreme rule. But the Board offers no basis, much less a principled one, on which to distinguish access easements that merit per se treatment from those that don't.

I'm a bit mystified by some of the arguments here because it seems like you're asking us to reinvent the wheel, but it's not a new issue at least as I see it. We decided unanimously in 1956 how to balance property rights against union organizing rights in the Babcock case. And then, of course, in Lechmere, we reiterated that in Justice Thomas's opinion for the Court there. The Babcock briefs, if you go back into those, those are all about property rights against union organizing rights, and then Babcock considers that and -- and sets forth a rule. Now I think you -- you probably prevail under that rule, but I'm -- I'm curious why your argument is not as simple as Justice Clark's -- California Supreme Court Justice Clark's argument in his dissent in the '76 case that you cite where he just says, under Babcock, there's a rule, the Board's regulation here goes beyond the Babcock rule by permitting blanket access under private -- onto private property during worker -- working hours and access when alternative means of communications do, in fact, exist.

In this area of the law, the Court has reserved per se treatment for extreme regulations that are the functional equivalent of the government directly appropriating private property.

Babcock was obviously a statutory case but informed by the Constitution explicitly, as I read it, and the question was how much access will we allow to property under the statute, the NLRA, given the constitutional backdrop of property rights? And the decision seems to reflect the Court's understanding of the Constitution and how much protection there is for property rights, at page 112 of the decision, and basically says no access unless you can show that there are no alternative means of communication that exist, to simplify what it says there.

In that case, could the reviewing court look at that evidence of mental illness, which was not presented to the jury, not presented in trial, on plain-error review, or -- or does your rule bar only the prosecution?","<speaker>M. Allison Guagliardo</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question at issue concerns the method an appellate court applies in conducting plain-error review of a defendant's trial and, in particular, what body of evidence an appellate court may rely on to affirm a given -- defendant's conviction at that trial. In this case, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed Mr. Greer's conviction by relying on information that had never been introduced at his trial. There are three fundamental problems with this approach. First, at prong 3 of plain-error review, the inquiry is whether the errors affected the outcome of the trial, meaning that verdict of guilt. Looking at information that was never before the fact-finder at trial is not relevant to that inquiry. Second, at prong 4 of plain-error review, it is fundamentally unfair to affirm a defendant's conviction based on information never introduced against him at trial. At a trial, a defendant is on notice that anything being introduced may be used by the fact-finder to determine his guilt. But outside the record of the trial, information may go untested and not be reliable for determining guilt. That is particularly the case here, where, because of the uniform circuit precedent before Rehaif, at no proceeding in the district court had the parties addressed or the judge found the mens rea required by this Court in Rehaif. The record was simply not constructed to address this element of the offense. And, third, there are practical problems to such an approach.

But prong 4 is talking more broadly about the public's perception of the judicial system as qua system.

And, there, I don't see why a judge can't look at the facts of -- of a particular case from beginning to end to determine whether the public would have seen this as an injustice. And given all of the circumstances or potential circumstances, some of which are just like this case, that Justice Alito mentioned, your defendant was just released from prison six months before he was arrested for this charge, and he had served either 20 months or 36 months, it's impossible to believe that there's any reasonable doubt that he could have put his knowledge in contention.

What I'm -- what I'm more interested in is, if it is that broad question, I mean, how to square that with the entire idea of the plain-error doctrine, because, you know, plain error is meant to encourage timely objections, give the court time to correct it, build a factual record, so on and so forth. But, on your rule, on the broad rule, the defendant can get a bare record if he just stays silent. And, you know, usually a bare record will mean reversal. So wouldn't that approach give the defendant an incentive not to object? And, of course, that won't be true in cases where there's an intervening change in law, but where there's not, isn't -- isn't he left in a better place than if he did object, and aren't we creating the wrong incentives?","<speaker>M.

Because then the government pointed out, and I think many of the questions you've gotten show, that step 3 maybe has a jury focus, but step 4 doesn't have anything to do with what the jury would think. It has to do more with what the public would think.

Adler</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States agrees that crack offenders sentenced under (b)(1)(C) have a covered offense under Section 404. Statutory text, history, and common sense all compel that conclusion. The textual dispute here boils down to whether Section 2 modified the statutory penalties for Petitioner's crack offense. It did. Because (b)(1)(C) cross-references (b)(1)(A) and (B), when Section 2 raised the crack quantities for (b)(1)(A) and (B), Section 2 also modified (b)(1)(C). That modification expanded the scope of conduct subject only to (b)(1)(C), and it changed the sentencing benchmarks by which (b)(1)(C) offenses are measured. Unable to dispute that modification, amicus argues that the phrase ""statutory penalties"" means the sentencing range. But Section 2 did not modify any sentencing ranges at all. It merely raised the crack quantities, and Congress knew that. History confirms that (b)(1)(C) offenses are covered. Shortly after enactment of Section 2, Congress approved the Sentencing Commission's decision to incorporate Section 2 into the guidelines for all crack offenders, including (b)(1)(C) offenders. And in the eight years leading up to Section 404, the Commission repeatedly used the phrase ""statutory penalties"" to refer to the higher crack quantities, not lower sentencing ranges. Finally, amicus's contrary interpretation would make little sense. It would cover kilogram-trafficking kingpins but exclude the lowest-level dealers. He has failed to offer any coherent explanation for why Congress would have done that. After all, Congress did not enact bipartisan criminal justice reform to create new anomalies. It enacted Section 404 to purge the taint of the discredited 100-to-1 disparity. To do that, it gave all crack offenders sentenced under that old regime an opportunity to seek a reduced sentence under Section 2's new statutory benchmarks.

Jones now contends that his sentence is still unconstitutional because the sentencing court did not also make a finding that Jones is permanently incorrigible. But that premise is wrong for three main reasons. Miller implicitly holds and Montgomery explicitly states that a finding of incorrigibility isn't required. Second, the individual life sentencing line of cases on which Miller relied demonstrates why Jones's position is unavailing. And, lastly, whether a crime reflects permanent incorrigibility or transient immaturity isn't a separate inquiry apart from the consideration of youth. Instead, this Court has used this terminology descriptively as a way to describe a crime the circumstances of which either do or do not make a life-without-parole sentence grossly disproportionate. And as this Court explained in Kansas versus Carr, whether mitigating circumstances exist to sufficiently warrant a lesser sentence is a judgment call or perhaps a value call. That is, it is a normative judgment reached after Miller's evaluative process. That process was followed here.</text>",2020

The answer to that is the process is what leads to the proportionality, at least as an Eighth Amendment matter. And by analogy, in the death penalty context, the Gregg versus Georgia context, we have said proportionality is required, but it's achieved in two ways. One, you rule out the death penalty or life without parole for a certain class of offenses or offenders. And, secondly, we require that the sentencer consider all the relevant mitigating and other relevant circumstances. That's the Lockett principle. And, here, I just want to make sure of your answer.

For example, a creditor is not required to turn over an asset if the debtor cannot provide adequate protection for the creditor's interest in the asset. A creditor that contends in good faith that an asset is not subject to turnover is entitled to judicial process to resolve that dispute without owing damages if the debtor ultimately repairs. Respondents' contrary argument fails for multiple reasons. First, reading the automatic stay to require turnover contravenes the ordinary meaning of the term ""stay,"" which is status quo preserving. Second, it would render the actual turnover provision superfluous and would nullify the statutory exceptions and defenses to turnover. Finally, no one contends that the automatic stay imposed a turnover duty before the 1984 amendment that added the words ""exercise control.""

And, second, there's no exception from plain-error review for claims that were foreclosed by circuit precedent at the time of the district court's proceeding. This Court's decisions in Puckett and Johnson rightly recognize that the Court lacks authority to create such an atextual exception out of whole cloth, and those holdings equally apply here. Plain-error review is not an absolute bar to relief. As demonstrated by the experience of every other court of appeals in the wake of this Court's decision in Rehaif, courts can and should grant relief under that standard in cases where a Rehaif error has truly worked an injustice. The Fourth Circuit's per se rule would thus only serve to undermine the careful balance between judicial efficiency and fairness established by the Federal Rules and to provide a windfall to defendants like Respondent, whose convictions were and remain fundamentally fair.

35815,2020.19-368-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch,"Good morning, Mr. Marotta. It seems to me this case really puts into sharp relief the difficulties our doctrinal tests have created. We've made a firm distinction between specific and general jurisdiction for many years. We say specific jurisdiction has to ""arise out of."" Everybody seems to know what that means. Nobody knows what ""relates to"" means, the other part of the test. And so I -- I guess -- I guess I want to take you back to first principles along the lines of Justice Thomas. What does due process require? I suppose one could say it's whatever fair play -- whatever we think fair play means, in which case you -- you might run into some of the troubles we've -- we've been hearing some of the questions about. But it could mean -- due process could mean a couple of other things. One, it could mean the law of the land. Are you being haled into court in accordance with the law of the land? And, surely, that -- that's met here, the state long-arm statute. No one contests that it reaches you. Or it might mean that, as originally understood, the Due Process Clause and the ideas behind the due process would not have allowed a defendant to be haled into court in these kinds of circumstances.

The relevant provision of Section 1447(d) authorizes appellate review of a remand order where a ground for removal was the federal officer or civil rights removal statute. By its plain terms, the statute permits review of the entire order, not particular issues. The court of appeals' contrary interpretation is invalid. Respondent offers virtually no textual defense of that interpretation, relying instead on case law, policy, and an alternative interpretation. But those arguments cannot trump the statutory text and, in any event, lack merit. As to case law, this Court and the courts of appeals have consistently interpreted statutes permitting appellate review of an order to authorize plenary review, and Respondent's two contrary examples involve unique considerations. As to policy, the plain text interpretation is consistent with Congress's special solicitude for cases involving civil rights and federal officers. That interpretation accords with the background principle of plenary review, would lead, at most, to marginal additional delay, and could actually expedite resolution of the appeal. And as to Respondent's alternative interpretation, a defendant removes a case pursuant to the federal officer removal statute when it invokes the statute in its notice of removal, regardless of the merits of that ground. The sole remaining question is how best to dispose of this case. The Court should reverse the judgment below because Respondent's claims necessarily arise under federal law. This Court's precedents dictate the commonsense conclusion that federal law governs claims alleging injury caused by worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.

You have the text that you assert, your reading of the text in -- in Yamaha obviously helps you, but there are also problems. One is the inequity between defendants, one of whom tacks on 1442 and therefore gets appellate review, the other of whom doesn't have the ability to tack on 1442 and doesn't get appellate review even though they have the same other attempted federal question ground. So that -- that's one problem, which makes it seem -- seem doubtful that Congress really intended this. There's also the gamesmanship problem. And then there's the ratification, which I want to zero in on with you. What exactly would you say about the ratification doctrine? Because, if you just read the Black Letter description of the ratification doctrine and lay it down here, it would seem to apply. So what -- why doesn't it apply?","<speaker>Brinton Lucas</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court should hold that Section 1447(d) means what it says. There is simply no natural way to read the phrase ""an order remanding a case"" as part of an order remanding a case. Therefore, once Section 1447(d) authorizes an appeal of a remand order, there's no basis for artificially limiting the scope of that appeal to a particular question. Respondent resists that straightforward reading but never denies that its approach would give the phrase ""an order remanding a case"" different meanings in two back-to-back clauses of the same sentence. Instead, Respondent pivots to a novel textual theory in its merits brief based on the phrase ""removed pursuant to."" But that argument can't be squared with how removal actually works.

First, they'd say: We deal with that problem up here -- you know, haven't you read Rule 39(a) -- and if there's a dispute, I'll go ask the writing judge what he or she wants to do, and if there's still going to be a fight, we'll send it down to the district court. Or the clerk is going to tell you: You go down to the district court -- haven't you read Rule 39(e) -- and if it -- there's still a fight down there, they'll bring it up here. But it seems to me that -- that your rule would sort of standardize all those local practices, which, as far as I can tell, haven't really been a problem, because you say the court of appeals has no -- no authority over this and it has to go to the district court in the first instance. Is that right?","<speaker>Daniel L. Geyser</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Rule 39 authorizes district courts to exercise discretion in denying or reducing taxable costs under Rule 39(e), and the Fifth Circuit's contrary position ignores the rule's plain language, makes nonsense of its structure, invites a host of obvious practical problems, and, if adopted here, would dramatically upset settled practice in every single jurisdiction nationwide, including, ironically, in the Fifth Circuit itself. Respondents have now wisely conceded that Rule 39(e) costs are discretionary. The only question is which court has the power to exercise that discretion. We say the district court because Rule 39(e) expressly says that Rule 39(e) costs are taxable in the district court. That clause embodies a permissive term in making a textual assignment to the district court, not the appellate court, and it does so against the explicit backdrop of provisions like Section 1920 that delegate textual discretion over the same overlapping costs to the district court. This straightforward design pushes down collateral fact-bound issues to the tribunal that is best equipped to take evidence, make a record, resolve factual disputes, and address these new issues in the first instance. Now Respondents say that Rule 39 vests only the appellate court with discretion, but their only hook for that belief is Rule 39(a), which is the rule's only provision that provides any role for the appellate panel. That rule, by its express terms, dictates only against whom costs are assessed. It says nothing about what those costs should be.

We say the district court because Rule 39(e) expressly says that Rule 39(e) costs are taxable in the district court. That clause embodies a permissive term in making a textual assignment to the district court, not the appellate court, and it does so against the explicit backdrop of provisions like Section 1920 that delegate textual discretion over the same overlapping costs to the district court. This straightforward design pushes down collateral fact-bound issues to the tribunal that is best equipped to take evidence, make a record, resolve factual disputes, and address these new issues in the first instance. Now Respondents say that Rule 39 vests only the appellate court with discretion, but their only hook for that belief is Rule 39(a), which is the rule's only provision that provides any role for the appellate panel. That rule, by its express terms, dictates only against whom costs are assessed. It says nothing about what those costs should be. Under the rule's design, the panel doesn't have access to the relevant information at the time of the subsection (a) determination. The panel doesn't have a formal cost request, it doesn't have any relevant evidence, it doesn't have a record on costs because there is no record on costs, and it doesn't know the opposing party's objections or the reasons certain costs should be denied or reduced. A court cannot intelligently exercise discretion without access to the relevant information, and the rule is specifically designed for the relevant information to come out after the Rule 39(a) determination is made.</text>",2020
