37426,2020.20-334-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett,"Good morning, Mr. Geyser. I want to go back to some of the questions that Justice Kagan was asking you, specifically about 28 U.S.C. 1924. So, as, you know, she read the text to you and it's kind of my question too, I mean, the district courts have discretion to decide whether the costs are correct and necessarily incurred in the case, is that right?","<speaker>Daniel L. Geyser</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Rule 39 authorizes district courts to exercise discretion in denying or reducing taxable costs under Rule 39(e), and the Fifth Circuit's contrary position ignores the rule's plain language, makes nonsense of its structure, invites a host of obvious practical problems, and, if adopted here, would dramatically upset settled practice in every single jurisdiction nationwide, including, ironically, in the Fifth Circuit itself. Respondents have now wisely conceded that Rule 39(e) costs are discretionary. The only question is which court has the power to exercise that discretion. We say the district court because Rule 39(e) expressly says that Rule 39(e) costs are taxable in the district court. That clause embodies a permissive term in making a textual assignment to the district court, not the appellate court, and it does so against the explicit backdrop of provisions like Section 1920 that delegate textual discretion over the same overlapping costs to the district court. This straightforward design pushes down collateral fact-bound issues to the tribunal that is best equipped to take evidence, make a record, resolve factual disputes, and address these new issues in the first instance. Now Respondents say that Rule 39 vests only the appellate court with discretion, but their only hook for that belief is Rule 39(a), which is the rule's only provision that provides any role for the appellate panel. That rule, by its express terms, dictates only against whom costs are assessed. It says nothing about what those costs should be. Under the rule's design, the panel doesn't have access to the relevant information at the time of the subsection (a) determination. The panel doesn't have a formal cost request, it doesn't have any relevant evidence, it doesn't have a record on costs because there is no record on costs, and it doesn't know the opposing party's objections or the reasons certain costs should be denied or reduced. A court cannot intelligently exercise discretion without access to the relevant information, and the rule is specifically designed for the relevant information to come out after the Rule 39(a) determination is made.</text>",2020
37427,2020.20-334-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett,"So why isn't this just a dispute about how broad the district court's discretion is to decide whether a particular cost, here, the bond amounts, were necessarily incurred? Because, as I gather, you're saying here, well, these weren't necessarily incurred. It wasn't necessary to get something that was this expensive. They could have done something different.

Under ordinary rules of grammar, a restrictive modifier that follows two disjunctive verbs modifies both, not just the second one. Three features of the statutory text here reinforce that conclusion. First, the punctuation. The modified phrase here is set off by a comma, which indicates that the phrase modifies both verbs. Second, the shared direct object. The direct object that follows ""produce,"" ""telephone numbers to be called,"" concededly applies equally to ""store"" as well as ""produce."" Having some but not all of the text that follows ""produce"" refer back to ""store"" requires a significant judicial rewrite. Third, the scope of the ATDS prohibitions. They do not prevent ATDS calls to the residential landlines used by most Americans in 1991. Instead, they target only the specialized lines -- emergency, cellular, and multiple business lines -- that were distinctly vulnerable to random and sequential dialing. That limited scope makes sense as a targeted response to the problems of random or sequential dialing. But, if Congress were really aiming at annoying calls from devices that could store and dial numbers, its failure to protect the home front would be inexplicable.</text>",2020

38470,2020.19-511-t01,petitioner,Amy Coney Barrett,"-- let me -- let me just stop, because I wasn't asking about the consent, because I want to ask you about something else too. So you talked in your brief about this concept of synesis, and I'm wondering whether you can identify any case, because your opponents say there is none, in which a court has relied on that concept. And I ask because it strikes me as the kind of concept that might make sense in some interpretive context, when one interprets some kind of language, say literary language. You know, you lean heavily on this idea that the ordinary speaker of language or what would make sense to people. And synesis kind of gets at that but gives it a different name. Is that a legal concept? I mean, you -- you actually -- you and Justice Scalia don't talk about it in reading law, but you do talk about it in modern English usage, which, of course, gets at a far broader range of interpretive problems and grammar problems. So is it a legal concept? Is it appropriately applied in the law?","<speaker>Paul D.
