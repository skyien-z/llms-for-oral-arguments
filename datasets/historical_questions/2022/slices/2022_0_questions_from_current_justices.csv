804,2022.21-432-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"Counsel, I have a question because you have set this up as whether or not we have a statute of limitations here, because you're trying to take advantage of Irwin and equal -- equitable tolling. But I typically conceive of statutes -- statutes of limitations as having a funneling effect, so we have to sort of start at what is the background rule or principle. And in the ordinary course of affairs, the default rule is that a plaintiff can pursue their remedies at any time, their claims at any time, and a statute of limitations limits, for all the reasons that you point out, limits their ability to pursue their remedies because we're trying to get them to do it quickly, because we're trying to preserve evidence. Whatever the reason Congress gives, it's sort of a funnel. Whereas, when I read this statute, you start at (b), but 510 has an (a), which I think is actually setting the default rule in this circumstance, that the (a) is telling us that at the beginning we have a very limited set of circumstances in which veterans can claim, you know, these kind -- this kind of compensation, right? (a) says, unless specifically provided, the effective date, right, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but not earlier than. It sets the effective date as essentially the application date. And so, if you look at it that way, we're not -- we don't have a funnel in the structure of this statute. We actually have more like a pyramid because the background rule is the effective date is the date of application, and what (b) is doing is giving some veterans under some circumstances more rights than they otherwise had. So maybe you can speak to whether I'm wrong about thinking -- thinking that, and that, of course, sort of undermines your view that (b) relates to a right of retroactive compensation as the sort of background principle.","<speaker>James R. Barney</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When service-disabled veterans are discharged from the military, they have one year under 5110(b)(1) to file a claim for retroactive disability compensation. This deadline operates like a statute of limitations by encouraging service-disabled veterans to promptly apply for -- for retroactive benefits or else lose that right forever. The Irwin presumption in favor of -- of equitable tolling applies to this one-year deadline because it's a non-jurisdictional claims-processing rule set forth in a statute for which Congress has waived sovereign immunity. Now the Secretary attempts to rebut the Irwin presumption by characterizing Section 5110 as a general rule subject to multiple exceptions, but that does not rebut the presumption. First, none of the other subsections the Secretary points to relate to service-connected disability compensation, which is the sole focus of 5110(b)(1). For example, the Secretary relies heavily on subsection (b)(4), but that sets a deadline for disability pensions, a different type of benefit passed by a different Congress at a different time. Other subsections set forth deadlines for dependency benefits, death benefits, and death pensions, none of which have any nexus to 5110(b)(1). Not one of those other deadlines would be rendered superfluous by the application of equitable tolling to 5110(b)(1). So this is not a situation where the deadline in question already includes an exception, an express exception, that would be swallowed by the application of equitable tolling. Here, there are zero express exceptions to the one-year deadline of 5110(b)(1). Finally, even if we accept the Secretary's argument that Congress provided equitable exceptions elsewhere in 5110, that only strengthens the Irwin presumption for 5110(b)(1) because, unlike in those other subsections, Congress chose to remain silent for 5110(b)(1), which is exactly what we would expect Congress to do if they -- if it wanted the general rule of equitable tolling to apply.

851,2022.21-1450-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,So how do you read this to be referencing the criminal absolute immunity that you say existed at common law?,"<speaker>Lisa S. Blatt</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Schooner Exchange held that general laws describing admiralty jurisdiction do not reach foreign sovereigns. The reasons for that clear statement rule -- notice and equality among independent nations -- apply with greater force here. It is outlandish to think that Section 3231 authorizes federal courts to convict Spain. The U.S. does not dispute that criminal trials against sovereigns were unthinkable in 1789, would violate international law today, are unprecedented anywhere, and would risk retaliation. But all the same is true for sovereign instrumentalities, which by definition are sovereign. Schooner Exchange, after all, is an instrumentality case, a ship. And the FSIA defines foreign states to include instrumentalities. U.S. instrumentalities like the Export-Import Bank are sovereign. The FSIA independently bars criminal jurisdiction. Section 1604 provides that foreign states shall be immune from the jurisdiction of federal and state courts. Reading the word ""civil"" into that text would mean Congress created special guardrails in civil cases but threw sovereigns to the wolves in criminal cases. The executive applauds this result, arguing that it alone makes the common law of criminal immunity. But the executive does not make the law, and an immunity waivable by your prosecutor is no immunity at all. Plus, the government's commercial instrumentality rule contradicts every common law benchmark, history, international practice, reciprocity, and the choice already made by Congress to define foreign states to include instrumentalities. Finally, Section 1605's commercial activities exception cannot apply in criminal cases. Section 1330 grants jurisdiction for the exceptions in civil cases only. And a contrary reading produces two radically implausible and dangerous results. Foreign states themselves would be stripped of criminal immunity in commercial cases, and because Section 1605 waives immunity in state courts, states could prosecute sovereigns and the executive would be powerless to stop it. I welcome questions.</text>",2022

In the last discussion with Ms. Blatt, the point was made states really haven't tried this, maybe a municipality here or there. But, if we hold that 1604 doesn't apply to criminal cases, then states would be free to try to bring lawsuits against Mexico for this or that, or perhaps China because of COVID, or who knows what a creative state prosecutor might come up with. And, normally, when a federal official is charged with some crime in state court, you have a right to removal. I think it's 1442 maybe. But there would be no corresponding right to removal by a foreign sovereign. And that's just -- that's a bit of an oddity, an incongruity in your argument. And the only place for review of these state court actions would be in this Court at the end of the day, perhaps at the end of those federal -- those state prosecutions or on some emergency interlocutory basis.

I want to get a grip on how this works, you know. So that provision requires the parties seeking to effect a foster care placement or termination of parental rights to satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitation programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family. And the government says, well, this applies to both private parties and state agencies. And so it's not directed at the state agencies in compelling government action, in compelling the state to take steps. How does this work?

So I think there's an aspect of your Article I argument that really boils down to a fundamental question that comes up in the law a lot, which is who decides. Who decides whether regulation in this area counts for Indian self-government, promotes Indian self-government, has a sufficient tether? I keep hearing you say in response to many of my colleagues' questions that you think that regulation related to family affairs does not have a sufficient connection to Indian self-government. But, in the actual legislative history of this -- of ICWA -- and I'm reading from the Federal Register -- Congress says that -- it indicates that ICWA reflects its ""concern about preserving the integrity of tribes as self-governing sovereign entities and ensuring that tribes could survive both culturally and politically."" That's 81 Fed. Reg. -- Federal Register 38,781. So it seems to me that Congress has made a decision that regulating in this area is important for preserving the integrity of tribes as self-governing sovereign entities, and, therefore, I don't think it's sufficient for you to say to us that you think that that's not true. So tell me how we're supposed to decide based on your view of whether or not this is a sufficient tether, as opposed to what Congress has said about it.","<speaker>Matthew D.

1423,2022.21-376-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"All right. Let me ask you another question. You have seemed to be very upset about Congress's exercise of plenary authority over Indian affairs. You say we need to look at it in a more narrow lens, I guess consistent with the sort of general understanding that Congress has limited authority. What I'm a little bit confused about and concerned about is whether it's really correct that we have to look at it so narrowly, that is, the scope of Congress's authority as it concerns Indian affairs, when we have said over and over again that Congress has plenary and exclusive authority, and when the history of our Constitution indicates that the constitutional design was about ensuring, in a way, that the federal government had the authority over the tribal relations, tribal affairs, and not the states. It seemed to me that baked into the Constitution's structure related to this, outside of just the Indian Commerce Clause provision, is the notion that the federal government, you know, vis--vis the states was going to be taking charge of this, especially in light of the Articles of Confederation precedent. So, if that's the case, then what -- what would you say about the thought that rather than, you know, searching for, you know, what additional limits there are on Congress's authority, we start with the premise that, with respect to Indian affairs, Congress has plenary authority and, therefore, as we've said in all of these prior cases, as long as it involves Indian affairs and Congress is making policy judgments, they have a constitutional basis for doing so?","<speaker>Matthew D.

The equal protection issue is difficult, I think, because we have to find the line between two fundamental and -- fundamental and critical constitutional values. So, on the one hand, the great respect for tribal self-government for the success of Indian tribes with -- and Indian peoples with recognition of the history of oppression and discrimination against tribes and people. So that's on the one hand. On the other hand, the fundamental principle we don't treat people differently on account of their race or ethnicity or ancestry, equal justice under law, I don't think we would ever allow, as the Court suggested in Palmore in 1984, Congress to say that white parents should get a preference for white children in adoption or that Latino parents should get a preference for Latino children in adoption proceedings. I don't think that would be permitted under that principle of equal justice that we recognized in Palmore. So those are the two principles on equal protection that I think focus the inquiry.

Justice Alito says they couldn't -- could they legislate? I don't know that I can see that they couldn't given the plenary power. And I'm also worried about the -- the sort of ahistorical gloss of this because it seems to me that there is ample evidence historically that the design of the Constitution gave the federal government that very power at the expense of the states, that we had had a previous set of circumstances in which the federal government and the state government shared power related to Indian affairs and that the Constitution came along and gave it to the federal government.

It replaces that test with a hierarchy of placement preferences that puts Native -- non-Indian families at the bottom of the list. As this Court explained in Holyfield, this effectuates a federal policy of sending Indian children to the Indian community. The problem is -- is that there are fewer than 2,000 Native American foster homes. That means each year hundreds, if not thousands, of Indian children are placed in non-Indian foster homes, and sometimes there they bond with those families. Yet, when those families try to adopt those children, ICWA rears its head for a second time, allowing tribes to play the proverbial ICWA trump card at the eleventh hour. This is happening now for a second time to the Brackeens as they try to adopt YRJ, who is now four-and-a-half years old. For a second time, the Brackeens are asked to show good cause to overcome the placement preferences under a new regulatory standard that, in the agency's words, is narrow, limited, and not a best interests test. Not even YRJ's deep attachment to the Brackeens after being part of their family for four years is sufficient. For both that child and her family, this flouts the promise of equal justice under the law. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2022

What I'm mostly concerned about is that we might be taking it upon ourselves to weigh those interests where, really, our role should be thinking about what the framers intended with respect to the scope of Congress's authority as it regards Indian affairs and what Congress believed was necessary to protect Indians given that exercise of authority. So I guess I'm -- that makes me wonder whether we shouldn't be giving more weight to the statements in the legislative history from Congress in terms of its decision that ICWA and its provisions were, in fact, related to tribal sovereignty, necessary to preserve tribal sovereignty. So let me just ask you, how -- how much weight, if any, should we be giving to clear, direct statements from Congress that this was being done pursuant to its understanding of its plenary authority as given it -- given to it in the Constitution and that it was necessary from Congress's perspective to solve for the problem of these state welfare practices that were causing harm to Indian children given its responsibility as a trust relationship for Indian affairs?","<speaker>Matthew D.

I understand Simmons and Lynch, but what I understand the Arizona Supreme Court to be saying, it does not -- under our rules, there's nothing more here, that they simply interpreted their Rule 32. How do we get from that interpretation of their rule to a federal question -- federal issue?","<speaker>Neal Kumar Katyal</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 2005, John Cruz was sentenced to death. The judge instructed jurors that, without a death sentence, Cruz would face ""life imprisonment with a possibility of parole."" The judge did so despite this Court's decision 11 years earlier in Simmons. Cruz's jury labored under a seriously wrong idea. Indeed, the jury foreman the very next day said: ""We wanted a reason to be lenient, and many of us would have rather voted for life, but we were not given an option to vote for life in prison without the possibility of parole."" Cruz wasn't the only one. Twelve separate times, 12 separate times, the Arizona Supreme Court wrote decisions refusing to apply Simmons. In 2016, this Court summarily reversed all this in Lynch, fundamentally changing capital trials in Arizona. Cruz then used Lynch to seek post-conviction relief under Arizona Rule 32.1(g). Yet, the Arizona Supreme Court refused, saying Lynch didn't change the law; it just changed the application of the law. That interpretation of Rule 32 is not an adequate and independent state ground for three separate reasons. First, to be adequate, an interpretation must be firmly established and regularly followed. This hair-splitting distinction between changes in the law and applications of the law is entirely novel, entirely hand-crafted. The state doesn't even defend it. Second, the decision below discriminates against federal rights. It places defendants like Cruz in a catch-22. To prevail under federal law, they have to argue that Lynch applied a settled rule, but that very argument dooms their claims under state law. It also discriminates against decisions of this Court by giving them narrower effect. And, finally, the decision below is not independent; it's interwoven with federal questions. The Arizona Supreme Court's analysis of Rule 32 turned on its reading of this Court's precedents. Simmons was the law of the land in 49 states, all except Arizona.

He comes here today on appeal of a successive state post-conviction judgment to obtain a new penalty phase so that he can request the parole ineligibility instructions under Simmons v. South Carolina, a case which predated his trial by over a decade. The Arizona Supreme Court's holding that Rule 32.1(g) precludes Petitioner's request for successive post-conviction relief is grounded in the core principle of finality and is adequate and an independent state ground for its judgment. The holding is adequate because Rule 32.1(g) has been firmly established and regularly followed. Under the rule, Arizona's indisputable interest in finality of criminal convictions can only yield to a claim based on those rare decisions announcing a new rule of law or a significant statutory or constitutional amendment. Here, Petitioner did not make that showing. This Court's 2016 decision in Lynch did not change the Simmons right. Instead, it merely corrected the Arizona Supreme Court's erroneous application of the Simmons rule in the unique context of Arizona's sentencing and parole statutes. Thus, the Arizona Supreme Court held that Lynch was not a significant change in the law under the rule, which is a state law holding. The Arizona Supreme Court's holding is also independent because its significant change analysis under the first prong of Rule 32.1(g) does not require any determination on the merits of Petitioner's federal law claim. This Court looked only to whether Lynch significantly changed existing law, which is a state procedural question. For these reasons, this Court should find that the Arizona Supreme Court's ruling was adequate and independent. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2022

On standing, Respondents' asserted injury is a complete mismatch for the relief they seek. They claim to want greater loan forgiveness than the plan provides, but they ask this Court to hold that the HEROES Act doesn't authorize loan forgiveness at all.

Respondents lack standing to seek that result. Parties cannot go to court to make themselves and everyone else worse off. To get around that problem, Brown and Taylor gesture at the idea that if the Secretary can't act under the HEROES Act, he might consider making an entirely different decision to grant debt relief under the Education Act.

It talks about forbearance and it talks about sort of economics/COVID conditions, forbearance as a kind of separate thing that people who have been granted forbearance for long periods of time are more likely to go into default or become delinquent in their payments. And I guess I wonder, is that about COVID, or is that just about something that happens when you excuse loan payments for a long period of time and how it is that that gets to be converted into an emergency COVID rationale? And then, on the economic considerations, and I think it was Justice Barrett who talked about this a little, it seems, you know, a real mixture of COVID and non-COVID-related things.

Since we're dealing in a -- in a case with individual borrowers or would-be borrowers, I think it appropriate to consider some of the fairness arguments. You know, you have two situations, both two kids come out of high school, they can't afford college, one takes a loan, and the other says, well, I'm going to, you know, try my hand at setting up a lawn care service, and he takes out a bank loan for that. At the end of four years, we know statistically that the person with the college degree is going to do significantly financially better over the course of life than the person without. And then along comes the government and tells that person: You don't have to pay your loan. Nobody's telling the person who is trying to set up the lawn service business that he doesn't have to pay his loan. He still does, even though his tax dollars are going to support the forgiveness of the loan for the -- the college graduate, who's now going to make a lot more than him over the course of his lifetime. Now it seems to me you may have views on fairness of that and they don't count. I may have views on the fairness of that and mine don't count.

This case concerns the reason -- the requirement that patents enable skilled artisans to make and use the invention.

The Federal Circuit here never identified a single actual antibody that's in the claims that can't be made or requires undue experimentation.

Lamken</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Amgen invented a new class of antibodies that lower cholesterol that bind to a small spot on PCSK9, the sweet spot, and thereby block that protein from binding to and destroying LDL receptors that remove cholesterol.

The roadmap in Amgen's patents allows skilled artisans to easily make those antibodies every time using two new anchor antibodies that cover the entire sweet spot so skilled artisans can be certain to make all the claims' antibodies, including defendants' examples. The Federal Circuit here never identified a single actual antibody that's in the claims that can't be made or requires undue experimentation.

Patents thus satisfy the law when sufficiently definite to guide artisans' successful application of the invention wherein there's some practical way of putting them into operation, requiring reasonableness with due regard to the patent's subject matter. In concrete terms, that means that those who are seeking to overto the P -- overturn the PTO's issuance of the patents and verdicts upholding them, here two verdicts, have to do two things: one, at least have evidence of some variant of the invention, some category, that require what this Court has called painstaking experimentation, and, two, if they identify that, show why that matters to skilled artisans, because the statute is about skilled artisans seeking to make and use the invention and reasonableness, not theoretical far corners never shown to affect the ability to do so.

2477,2022.21-757-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"But I've got to do the experiment in order to know this, right?","<speaker>Jeffrey A. Lamken</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Amgen invented a new class of antibodies that lower cholesterol that bind to a small spot on PCSK9, the sweet spot, and thereby block that protein from binding to and destroying LDL receptors that remove cholesterol. Amgen had in hand 384 examples before the Texas article Sanofi cites as hypothesizing such antibodies, before Sanofi began researching PCSK9. This case concerns the reason -- the requirement that patents enable skilled artisans to make and use the invention. The roadmap in Amgen's patents allows skilled artisans to easily make those antibodies every time using two new anchor antibodies that cover the entire sweet spot so skilled artisans can be certain to make all the claims' antibodies, including defendants' examples. The Federal Circuit here never identified a single actual antibody that's in the claims that can't be made or requires undue experimentation. Instead, it invoked something that no one will defend is even relevant here: the cumulative effort to make all or some large group of an invention's potentially myriad variations. This Court's cases, however, reflect the Act's pragmatic boots-on-the-ground focus on enabling skilled artisans who want to practice the invention on a concrete action, making and using the invention. Patents thus satisfy the law when sufficiently definite to guide artisans' successful application of the invention wherein there's some practical way of putting them into operation, requiring reasonableness with due regard to the patent's subject matter.

The Federal Circuit has long enforced that basic principle by requiring the patentee to enable the full scope of the patent without undue experimentation. Amgen does not take issue with that test, with the Wands factors, I think, or the vast bulk of the Federal Circuit's enablement precedent. But the full scope test, which they don't take issue with at least as I understand it, dooms their claims here, as well illustrated by the chart on page 15 of the red brief. Amgen claims antibodies that -- that bind on 16 residues in the epitope, but their -- their specification does not enable skilled artisans to reliably produce them when they bind at 10 or more. And those aren't hypothetical examples. Those are the competitive antibodies that independently develop by their competitors in the four right-hand columns. They're disclosed embodiments, the 26 do not bind at more than nine residues. They've overclaimed, they've underenabled, their patent is invalid. This Court has long applied the same principle in Morse, in Lamp, and in Holland Furniture. Samuel Morse invented the telegraph. He did not invent the fax machine. That is why this Court correctly rejected the final broad functional claim in his patent. Thomas Edison discovered the key to incandescent light, but we'd all be fumbling around in the dark if this Court had not invalidated the broad unenabled claims in Sawyer and Man's patent in the Lamp case.

Amgen had in hand 384 examples before the Texas article Sanofi cites as hypothesizing such antibodies, before Sanofi began researching PCSK9. This case concerns the reason -- the requirement that patents enable skilled artisans to make and use the invention. The roadmap in Amgen's patents allows skilled artisans to easily make those antibodies every time using two new anchor antibodies that cover the entire sweet spot so skilled artisans can be certain to make all the claims' antibodies, including defendants' examples. The Federal Circuit here never identified a single actual antibody that's in the claims that can't be made or requires undue experimentation. Instead, it invoked something that no one will defend is even relevant here: the cumulative effort to make all or some large group of an invention's potentially myriad variations. This Court's cases, however, reflect the Act's pragmatic boots-on-the-ground focus on enabling skilled artisans who want to practice the invention on a concrete action, making and using the invention.

And it requires limiting the relator's status and rights where the Act unambiguously says the court may not limit the relator's status and rights.

If Congress truly intended the government to have a global right to dismiss a declined case at any time, this is not remotely how the statute would read.

Congress could have easily said that the government may dismiss only ""if the government elects to intervene."" Those are the words that Congress used elsewhere in the statute when it wanted to make a right contingent on the government's election to intervene. Yet Congress didn't include those words or anything like them in Section 3730(c)(2)(A). Thus, regardless of the option that the United States selects, it retains the right to dismiss the action. The second issue in this case concerns the extent to which a court may review the government's decision to dismiss.

So a district court issues a denial of summary judgment on -- you're right, he said, I think, as a matter of law, IIU is good enough to excuse. But things happen between summary judgment and trial, and a district court's initial ruling on a denial of summary judgment, if I'm the district court judge, I might feel a little sandbagged by this procedure and -- and without having had an opportunity at trial to reconsider my initial decision. I have not entered judgment in favor of the other side. I just denied a motion for summary judgment. And I might -- I might -- I might have wanted the opportunity to say -- here's what would often happen, I think, is the district judge would say, you put on your affirmative defense, put on all your evidence, and let's go to the jury, and the jury may reject it, in which case I'm home free. I don't have to worry about it. Or, if the jury accepts your affirmative defense, I can then enter judgment as a matter of law for the other side at that point, and then all the evidence is in the record, it's all fully complete for the court of appeals, so the court of appeals can decide my -- my JMOL ruling after trial, and if it rejects it, it's got the full record available to it, and it can affirm the jury verdict and we don't have to go try it again.

The rule would not prevent retrials, for example, following successful appeal because any subsidiary fact disputes would not have been the subject of the trial.

Seemingly recognizing that the ""add one sentence"" rule has no point, Mr. Younger pivoted to an astonishingly wasteful rule in his merits brief in this Court. Under that rule, he says, to preserve a purely legal issue for appeal, parties should insist on trying the case as if the claim was not already foreclosed.

So he took their position contrary to yours. I look at the 86 contracts that you mentioned, many of them are boundaries, many are water rights. I'm -- I'm actually not sure that -- where we get the default provision that those are indefinite because what we're saying is states shouldn't be presumed to give up their sovereignty, and particularly with water rights cases, that's exactly what they're doing. They have sovereignty over that water and its use. So I don't know where this general rule comes. I also look at the contracts, and certain numbers do reflect unilateral withdrawal. Some don't.

This compact is precisely the sort of arrangement from which parties can presumptively withdraw. In 1953, New York and New Jersey agreed to each delegate their own licensing and policing powers to the bistate agency.

So I'm still sort of interested in the Chief Justice's points about the rule of decision and how it is that we determine whether or not something is jurisdictional and that we used to do it in a different way in the past and now we have a clearer standard. And it appears that from Boechler we said, well, we don't go back and do it over again. But I guess I'm wondering, if we don't do it over, how do we get everybody on the same page around this kind of determination? It seems to me that you could then have -- if we say -- if we've spoken to this in the past before and we've labeled it jurisdictional, and, under today's test, the answer would be non-jurisdictional, but we're stuck because we previously spoke to it, then you might have a situation in which, you know, near-identical if not identical statutory provisions that have the same text, structure, and even history related to this time bar question would have different legal results about the characterization because some of them we had spoken to before and we said jurisdictional, and the new ones, the ones that we hadn't spoken -- maybe they're old, they're old, they were passed by Congress at exactly the same time, but we never had the question before us before about that provision, and that comes to us today and we apply the new rule because we don't have. And that seems to me a really messy and odd way, as opposed to just saying today we have a test, you're bringing this question, I thought the question presented here was is this jurisdictional, you're bringing it to us today, and we're going to apply the test we had today, and to the extent that it's different than what we said in the past, we just chalk it up to the fact that we have a new rule of decision.","<speaker>Jeffrey W.

Do we strictly construe them and so forth? And -- and so the -- the issue on that page is really about how do we go about interpreting waivers of sovereign immunity. It's nothing about this jurisdictional question. And -- and then, on page 292, five pages later, it says, you know, the suit is barred, and so the courts below had no jurisdiction. I mean, that's just a very standard thing that we've noticed in many of our opinions, which is that instead of saying so the court shouldn't have addressed the issue, we say so the court had -- didn't have jurisdiction over the issue, because we're not making a clear distinction between real jurisdiction and other reasons not to address issues.","<speaker>Benjamin W.

First, Block and Mottaz reflected this Court's considered and binding judgment that the time bar was jurisdictional and therefore merits stare decisis respect. In both cases, the Court cited earlier decisions that had recognized the strictly jurisdictional nature of comparable limits, and in both cases, the jurisdictional determination had concrete significance for the litigation before the Court. They were not mere drive-by jurisdictional rulings. Second, when Congress amended the Quiet Title Act in 1986, it ratified the jurisdictional determinations of not only this Court but also of the courts of appeals, which had uniformly agreed that the time bar was strictly jurisdictional. Third and finally, revisiting the time bar's jurisdictional status would cause unnecessary disruption. At a broad level, it would leave the lower courts confused about when they have to comply with this Court's applications of governing law. And at a narrower level, Petitioners' rule would just delay the resolution of disputed timeliness questions, preventing their resolution as threshold issues and instead requiring potentially meaningless trials on the merits of decades-old easements and property lines.

First, Grutter assumed that race would only be a plus. But race is a minus for Asians, a group that continues to face immense racial discrimination in this country. Asians should be getting into Harvard more than whites, but they don't because Harvard gives them significantly lower personal ratings. Harvard ranks Asians less likable, confident, and kind, even though the alumni who actually meet them disagree. What Harvard is doing to Asians, like what it was doing to Jews in the 1920s, is shameful, but it's a predictable result of letting universities use race in highly subjective processes. Second, Grutter assumed that applicants would be treated as individuals, not as members of racial groups, but Harvard gives racial preferences based on the box that applicants check, even if they never write about race or explain how it influences their views. And for competitive applicants, checking the right racial box is an anvil on the admissions scale, worth the same as ultra rare achievements like winning a national championship. Third, Grutter assumed that universities would seriously consider race-neutral alternatives, but Harvard never once did so until 2017, three years after we sued it.

First, Grutter assumed that race would only be a plus. But race is a minus for Asians, a group that continues to face immense racial discrimination in this country. Asians should be getting into Harvard more than whites, but they don't because Harvard gives them significantly lower personal ratings. Harvard ranks Asians less likable, confident, and kind, even though the alumni who actually meet them disagree. What Harvard is doing to Asians, like what it was doing to Jews in the 1920s, is shameful, but it's a predictable result of letting universities use race in highly subjective processes. Second, Grutter assumed that applicants would be treated as individuals, not as members of racial groups, but Harvard gives racial preferences based on the box that applicants check, even if they never write about race or explain how it influences their views. And for competitive applicants, checking the right racial box is an anvil on the admissions scale, worth the same as ultra rare achievements like winning a national championship. Third, Grutter assumed that universities would seriously consider race-neutral alternatives, but Harvard never once did so until 2017, three years after we sued it. Harvard now refuses to eliminate its legacy preferences or boost its socioeconomic preferences, even though both changes would make Harvard far less white, wealthy, and privileged.

If -- if we can achieve racial diversity through neutral mechanisms rather than through race-conscious mechanisms, we should. We've said that many times. So the question is, when can we say that we can achieve our racial diversity goals in that way? And I guess I have a two-part question and -- and then an assumption that I want you to bake into the two parts. The first is, what is Harvard doing in an ongoing way to test whether that is true? And the second is, does Harvard see any progress along that dimension? In other words, I think it was said by Petitioner's counsel, oh, Harvard is doing -- you know, is putting this -- is -- is -- is using as great a preference as it ever did. And the question is, over time, has Harvard found that it has become less necessary to use race-conscious means or not? Here's the assumption that I want to have you bake into this, which is I take Petitioners to be saying, and I think that this is an important thing, that it doesn't matter if some part of the reason for adopting race-neutral approaches is to achieve racial diversity. I think that they very clearly said that. I'm not sure I understand why given their legal arguments, but I think that they very clearly said that. So assume that you can, you know, sit down and say we're -- we're -- we're -- we're trying to figure out what race-neutral mechanisms to use, and part of the goal is to achieve racial diversity.

If it had wanted to create such liability for supporting international terrorism writ large, it likewise had a model in Section 2331(1).

7224,2022.21-1496-t01,petitioner,Neil Gorsuch,"Mr. Waxman, I can't help but wonder whether some of the struggle you've had this morning with my colleagues about the scope of the aiding-and-abetting statute comes from your reading of the text. And turning to 2333(d)(2), as I understand it, you read the aiding-and-abetting clause as taking as its object the act of international terrorism rather than the person who committed the act. And that -- that seems a pretty abstract way to read the statute. Aiding an action or an explosion or -- or some -- something like that in the world, it's very different than how we normally read aiding-and-abetting statutes, sort of the common -- understanding of the common law, where you have to aid and abet a person. And you read the conspiracy clause to take as its object a person, the person. And I just wonder whether the better reading of the statute is that both of those ""who"" clauses, both -- both the aiding and abetting and the conspiracy clause, take as their object the person who committed the act of international terrorism. And I wonder why you haven't pressed that argument a little bit further, because it seems to me it helps you. The plaintiff would have to plead and prove that the defendant helped, aided and abetted or conspired with, a person who committed an act of international terrorism. And the Dictionary Act defines ""persons"" as real persons and juridical entities, not an explosion or some other action in the world.

The foundational points here are not in dispute. First, the conceded and obvious act of international terrorism is the Reina attack, and the complaint includes no allegation that the defendants provided substantial assistance, much less knowing substantial assistance, to that attack or, for that matter, to any other attack. Second, as the complaint concedes, the defendants ""had no intent to aid ISIS's terrorist activities."" Quite to the contrary, they maintained and regularly enforced policies prohibiting content that promotes terrorist activity. The plaintiff's claim that because defendants were generally aware that among their billions of users were ISIS adherents who violated their policies and, therefore, defendants should have done more to enforce those policies does not constitute aiding and abetting an act of international terrorism under the operative terms of the text, the constitutional principles articulated in Halberstam, or any recognized understanding of what it means to abet a criminal act. If Congress had wanted to impose treble damage liability for existing -- assisting a terrorist organization, it had a ready model in the material support statute, Section 2339B. If it had wanted to create such liability for supporting international terrorism writ large, it likewise had a model in Section 2331(1).

First, the conceded and obvious act of international terrorism is the Reina attack, and the complaint includes no allegation that the defendants provided substantial assistance, much less knowing substantial assistance, to that attack or, for that matter, to any other attack. Second, as the complaint concedes, the defendants ""had no intent to aid ISIS's terrorist activities."" Quite to the contrary, they maintained and regularly enforced policies prohibiting content that promotes terrorist activity. The plaintiff's claim that because defendants were generally aware that among their billions of users were ISIS adherents who violated their policies and, therefore, defendants should have done more to enforce those policies does not constitute aiding and abetting an act of international terrorism under the operative terms of the text, the constitutional principles articulated in Halberstam, or any recognized understanding of what it means to abet a criminal act. If Congress had wanted to impose treble damage liability for existing -- assisting a terrorist organization, it had a ready model in the material support statute, Section 2339B. If it had wanted to create such liability for supporting international terrorism writ large, it likewise had a model in Section 2331(1). Instead, it provided a remedy against those who conspire with terrorists or -- or who knowingly aid and abet acts of terrorism. It did not impose treble damage liability on companies whose services were exploited by terrorists in contravention of the company's enforced antiterrorism policies.

Fisher</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fifth Circuit's decision here stretches the aggravated identity theft statute beyond its breaking point. Overbilling Medicaid by $101 may provide fodder for a simple healthcare fraud prosecution, but, as even the concurring judges below recognized, it does not meet any ordinary understanding of the term ""identity theft."" Nor, for two independent reasons, does Mr. Dubin's conduct fall within the terms of Section 1028A. First, he did not use Patient L's name in relation to his healthcare fraud offense. That statutory element requires that the use of the name be instrumental, not merely incidental, to the fraud. In a fraud case, another way to think about that is it requires the name to be the ""who"" in the fraud, that is, misrepresenting who received services, not merely how or when those services were received. And Mr. Dubin's conduct falls only in the latter camp. Second, Mr. Dubin did not use Patient L's identity without lawful authority. He had permission to use Patient L's identity to bill Medicaid for psychological services, and that's precisely what he did. A contextual perspective confirms this analysis. The federal fraud statute that's the predicate here, like the other federal fraud statutes, covers an enormously broad swath of conduct, and, therefore, Congress has made prison time discretionary in those instances. And as the Federal Defenders' brief explains, the median sentence in a fraud case in this country is 12 months. Twenty-five percent of offenders receive only probation. The sentence -- this statute, by contrast, requires a two-year mandatory minimum.

Overbilling Medicaid by $101 may provide fodder for a simple healthcare fraud prosecution, but, as even the concurring judges below recognized, it does not meet any ordinary understanding of the term ""identity theft."" Nor, for two independent reasons, does Mr. Dubin's conduct fall within the terms of Section 1028A. First, he did not use Patient L's name in relation to his healthcare fraud offense. That statutory element requires that the use of the name be instrumental, not merely incidental, to the fraud. In a fraud case, another way to think about that is it requires the name to be the ""who"" in the fraud, that is, misrepresenting who received services, not merely how or when those services were received. And Mr. Dubin's conduct falls only in the latter camp. Second, Mr. Dubin did not use Patient L's identity without lawful authority. He had permission to use Patient L's identity to bill Medicaid for psychological services, and that's precisely what he did. A contextual perspective confirms this analysis. The federal fraud statute that's the predicate here, like the other federal fraud statutes, covers an enormously broad swath of conduct, and, therefore, Congress has made prison time discretionary in those instances. And as the Federal Defenders' brief explains, the median sentence in a fraud case in this country is 12 months. Twenty-five percent of offenders receive only probation. The sentence -- this statute, by contrast, requires a two-year mandatory minimum. So all indications are what Congress was doing is targeting a particularly egregious form of fraud, use of somebody's name through stealing it, misappropriating it, or -- or impersonating the person, identity theft.

The federal fraud statute that's the predicate here, like the other federal fraud statutes, covers an enormously broad swath of conduct, and, therefore, Congress has made prison time discretionary in those instances. And as the Federal Defenders' brief explains, the median sentence in a fraud case in this country is 12 months. Twenty-five percent of offenders receive only probation. The sentence -- this statute, by contrast, requires a two-year mandatory minimum. So all indications are what Congress was doing is targeting a particularly egregious form of fraud, use of somebody's name through stealing it, misappropriating it, or -- or impersonating the person, identity theft. But, if the government is right and if the Fifth Circuit is right about how broad the statute is, what it would do is it would transform fraud prosecutions to having every one of them be essentially an aggravated identity theft prosecution too, and that would thwart's Congress's careful design. The Court should reverse, and I'm happy to answer any questions the Court has.</text>",2022
