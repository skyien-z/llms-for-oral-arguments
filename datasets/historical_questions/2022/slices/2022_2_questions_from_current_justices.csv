So that -- that is in many provisions of the code. And, essentially, this just matches it. You know, you can collect from either one. There are two sources of -- there are two pots that one can collect from, and, you know, this is reflective of that. Is it absolutely necessary? It's not for exactly the reason you say. But it's totally understandable as a way of drafting, if you're thinking about Congress saying, after the liability judgment has been made, after an assessment is -- is put on the books, do whatever you need to do to collect money from either the taxpayer or the beneficiary/transferee.","<speaker>Shay Dvoretzky</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress enacted Section 7609 to give the public critical privacy rights to notice and an opportunity to quash third-party IRS summonses. Congress carefully limited the exceptions to those rights. In clause (1), Congress allowed the IRS to forgo notice for a summons issued ""in aid of the collection of an assessment against the person with respect to whose liability the summons is issued."" In clause (2), Congress separately dispensed with notice for summonses ""issued in aid of the collection of the liability of any transferee or fiduciary of a delinquent taxpayer with an assessment or judgment."" But the Sixth Circuit, like the IRS, nullified most of what Congress wrote. It read clause (1) to contain just nine words, a summons ""issued in aid of the collection of an assessment."" Period. The IRS says those nine words mean that anytime it's made an assessment, there are no judicially reviewable limits on its power to issue secret, overbroad, third-party summonses. So nothing stops the IRS from secretly summonsing all unredacted bank records of anyone who ever received money from a delinquent taxpayer: a lawn care company, a friend splitting a dinner check through Venmo, or, as here, a law firm. Never mind clause (2). Never mind the rest of the words in clause (1). Never mind the different language Congress used in another exception for summonses issued ""in connection with"" a criminal investigation. The Sixth Circuit and IRS's interpretation is inconsistent with the statute's text, context, and purpose, and it would create the same opportunity for abuse that Congress sought to eradicate. The question isn't whether the IRS can summons the records it needs, only whether it can do so secretly and without judicial oversight. The IRS says trust us, we police ourselves.

12732,2022.21-1599-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas,"Well, Mr. McDowell, this is quite a broad statute. I was interested in the -- the way this is initiated is through an assessment, and I was interested in how you established an assessment to start this process. And you cite us in your brief on page 17 to Laing versus U.S., number -- Footnote Number 13, which has some issues with circularity because it says the assessment, essentially -- the assessment, essentially a bookkeeping notation, is made when the Secretary or its delegate establishes an account against a taxpayer on the tax rolls. And, in other words, that boils down to it is when -- there's an assessment when the Secretary says there is an assessment. So the -- what would limit what you can do after you establish an assessment and then begin a collection process?","<speaker>Ephraim McDowell</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The statute in this case requires that notice and judicial review be given to persons identified in a third-party summons issued in aid of a liability investigation. But Congress made an express exception to those entitlements for summonses issued in aid of collection of an assessment made against a delinquent taxpayer. We would read that collection exception by its terms, and because the summonses here were issued in aid of collection of a $2 million assessment against Mr. Polselli, the collection exception applies in this case. Petitioners, however, would disturb the balance that Congress struck by inserting two artificial limitations into the statute, namely, a direct connection requirement that supposedly leads into a legal interest test. But nothing in the statutory text, context, or history even hints at those limitations, and those limitations lack any established legal meaning, so their boundaries are amorphous. Petitioners say their limitations are necessary to impose a check on the IRS's summons authority. But multiple other checks exist, including the prospect of a challenge by the recipient of the third-party summons. Ultimately, Petitioners' position is that the statute is an unqualified pro-privacy guarantee. But, in fact, like many statutes, this one is a compromise. While Congress prioritized privacy rights at the liability investigation phase, it prioritized prompt and efficient collection of taxes at the collection phase, and it did so because, when we're at the collection phase, that necessarily means that there's a delinquent taxpayer who's refusing to pay an assessed liability and likely deliberately evading collection.

That result follows from the centuries-old divestiture rule, as well as by Congress's choice to adopt an asymmetric interlocutory rule in FAA Section 16(a). The parties today agree on a lot, notably, that the divestiture rule of Griggs is the law. The filing of a notice of appeal divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal. The only question today is whether district court proceedings are aspects of the case involved in the appeal. For three reasons, the answer is yes. First, Congress amended the FAA to allow immediate appeals when district courts deny motions to compel arbitration but not when they approve them. And Congress did something else unusual. It made those appeals nondiscretionary. Those choices reflect Congress's fear about the interim harm from continued litigation. In 1988, Griggs was ensconced as the law, and Congress knew that authorizing these interlocutory appeals would authorize the usual stays too. Indeed, when Congress wants to prevent a mandatory stay, they say so expressly with anti-stay laws. Congress enacted such a provision one day before 16(a) was enacted, but 16(a) has no anti-stay provision. Second, these appeals involve the entirety of the district court case. An arbitration agreement does two things. First, it bans district court proceedings and, second, is an affirmative consent to an alternative process. The whole point of an immediate appeal is to protect those rights before they're lost.

At the moment in which you're taking the interlocutory appeal that they authorize under Section 16, what you are vindicating is your claim that this is subject to arbitration after a district court has denied you that motion. What I guess I don't understand is it seems to me that your argument is asking for an extension of the stay principle in the following way. So Section 3 tells us that once a district court decides, yes, yes, you can go to arbitration, then, upon application of a party, the district court has to stay the trial proceedings. Now, presumably, if a party doesn't ask, the district court can keep going. But you're now suggesting that in a situation in which the district court says no, you don't go to arbitration, somehow Congress intended for that circumstance, the appeal of arbitrability, to also give rise to an automatic stay, and I guess I don't understand that.","<speaker>Neal Kumar Katyal</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a party appeals the denial of a motion to compel arbitration, it stays litigation.

An arbitration agreement does two things. First, it bans district court proceedings and, second, is an affirmative consent to an alternative process. The whole point of an immediate appeal is to protect those rights before they're lost. And, third, it's undisputed the district court action is stayed in other interlocutory contexts, such as qualified immunity.

13136,2022.22-105-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,-- be -- here -- here -- why did they put it in 3 then?,"<speaker>Neal Kumar Katyal</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a party appeals the denial of a motion to compel arbitration, it stays litigation. That result follows from the centuries-old divestiture rule, as well as by Congress's choice to adopt an asymmetric interlocutory rule in FAA Section 16(a). The parties today agree on a lot, notably, that the divestiture rule of Griggs is the law. The filing of a notice of appeal divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal. The only question today is whether district court proceedings are aspects of the case involved in the appeal. For three reasons, the answer is yes. First, Congress amended the FAA to allow immediate appeals when district courts deny motions to compel arbitration but not when they approve them. And Congress did something else unusual. It made those appeals nondiscretionary. Those choices reflect Congress's fear about the interim harm from continued litigation. In 1988, Griggs was ensconced as the law, and Congress knew that authorizing these interlocutory appeals would authorize the usual stays too. Indeed, when Congress wants to prevent a mandatory stay, they say so expressly with anti-stay laws. Congress enacted such a provision one day before 16(a) was enacted, but 16(a) has no anti-stay provision. Second, these appeals involve the entirety of the district court case.

Zavareei</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress says what it means and it means what it says. So let's begin, as we must, with the text of Section 16 of the FAA. Congress says nothing in Section 16 about mandatory stays. And this Court has held in the Scripps-Howard case that Congress would not, without clearly expressing such a purpose, deprive the courts of their customary power to order stays under review. So what if we look beyond Section 16? Again, this Court has held under very similar circumstances in the Nken case that when Congress includes particular language in one section but excludes it from another section of the same Act, that Congress acts intentionally and purposely with respect to the disparate inclusion and exclusion. And, here, in this case, we have two examples of this inclusion/exclusion dichotomy. First, we have Section 3 of the FAA itself, which includes a mandatory stay, and then we have Section 1292(d)(4)(B), which was part of the same Act as Section 16. Under basic rules of statutory construction then, Section 16 cannot be said to harbor a hidden automatic stay provision. And, as a practical matter, this means that the courts retain their equitable power to use their discretion to issue stays when appropriate, a power that has been vested in this Court since the founding of the republic. And that is as it should be because stays are an important power and are important when appropriate. But whether they are appropriate depends. With respect to Section 16 appeals, it depends on the type of discovery allowed for under the arbitration clause. It depends on the strength of the arbitrability appeal. It depends on the weighing of the equities. And it depends on the -- on the public interest at stake in the underlying litigation. Let me just finish by saying there is no such thing as a Griggs divestiture rule. That is made up by my friend on the other side.

I don't think -- it's not a made-up -- it's a real case and we've got to figure out if the principle applies here. And then, second, Mr. Katyal -- I think you need to respond -- says that if you look at the body of the U.S. Code, Congress is explicit when it doesn't want to have a mandatory stay accompanying an interlocutory appeal and it's done so in 11 statutes.

I'd like to ask what if he wins. And my concern is a little bit about confusion with respect to our collateral order doctrines and the extent to which people would think that any dispositive motion that is denied and that could be appealed up to the court of appeals would somehow be authorized as a result of this, because he says, for example, this is integral, this is touching upon what's happening with the progress of this litigation because the order is about arbitration and that's another forum, and if we continue to go to trial, we will undermine our right to arbitrate. And I would think there's, like, a lot of pretrial dispositive circumstances that bear those same hallmarks. So, if the court denies a motion for a statute of limitations or the court denies a motion for, you know, a dismissal under personal jurisdiction problems, all of these scenarios, I think, kind of have that same inherent problem.

First, we have Section 3 of the FAA itself, which includes a mandatory stay, and then we have Section 1292(d)(4)(B), which was part of the same Act as Section 16. Under basic rules of statutory construction then, Section 16 cannot be said to harbor a hidden automatic stay provision. And, as a practical matter, this means that the courts retain their equitable power to use their discretion to issue stays when appropriate, a power that has been vested in this Court since the founding of the republic. And that is as it should be because stays are an important power and are important when appropriate. But whether they are appropriate depends. With respect to Section 16 appeals, it depends on the type of discovery allowed for under the arbitration clause. It depends on the strength of the arbitrability appeal. It depends on the weighing of the equities. And it depends on the -- on the public interest at stake in the underlying litigation.

On pages 47 to 50 of our brief, we cite a series of cases of this Court that stand for the proposition that courts will not intervene in pending agency proceedings until the proceedings culminate in an order or a rule that sets legal obligations, imposes a sanction, et cetera. One of those is Myers versus Bethlehem Shipbuilding. In that case, the shipbuilding company was in NLRB proceedings and said my operations don't have a sufficient connection to interstate or foreign commerce to make me regulable under the National Labor Relations Act.

If you look at the relevant page of Metropolitan Edison, you'll see literally a page of string cites to earlier cases decided before 1938 that established this principle.

What makes the most sense for the government? What makes the most sense for the citizens? What makes the most sense for the court system? And I think cutting against your position on that question is you can get more certainty, more clarity quicker about a basic fundamental question about the constitutionality of the agency itself or the agency's structure itself. Now one thing that I would be concerned about that supports you is floodgates, delay, obstruction. But, you know, unless you get -- unless the plaintiffs challenging the procedures get a preliminary injunction, the agency procedures are just going to continue on, and to get a preliminary injunction, they would have to, you know, show likelihood of success. So that would deter, I would think, frivolous claims or claims that are not meritorious.

It's not clear to me why the situation here is in any meaningful sense parallel to the situation in a case where a party invokes the collateral order doctrine.

In the ordinary sense of the word, the -- the orders that fall within the collateral order doctrine are not final. They're not the last order in the case that finishes everything up. So it's a -- it -- it -- it is an exception to the ordinary meaning of clear statutory language, final decision. Here, you have your APA argument. I understand.

At the outset, Justice Sotomayor said, you know, pointing to the Tenth Amendment and other structural assumptions of the Constitution, that we presume that states possess power unless they've given it up. So this is my question about the Elections Clause. If it did not appear in the Constitution, would the baseline assumption have been that the states possess the power to regulate elections for federal office anyway? Because, if so, I don't see how it's a delegation as suppose -- as opposed to a clause that clips state authority perhaps by saying it must be exercised by the legislature and by giving Congress the power of override. But I wouldn't describe that as a delegation if the states had the baseline power to start.","<speaker>David H.

And on -- as to that point, the dissent was right with the majority. So both of them took issue with the proposition that legislatures would exercise their authority without the constitutional checks that a state court provides. And then, in Rucho, three years ago, the Court assured everybody in a case very much like this one, it was a case about gerrymandering, and it says complaints about districting need not echo into a void because provisions in state statutes and state constitutions can provide standards and guidance for state courts to apply in addressing gerrymandering.

States lack the authority to restrict the legislatures' substantive discretion when performing this federal function. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 78, the scope of legislative authority is governed by the commission under which it is exercised. Here, that commission is contained in the United States Constitution, and it is federal law alone that places substantive restrictions on state legislatures performing the tasks assigned them by the federal Constitution. The most prominent discussion of the Elections Clause in the early republic occurred during Massachusetts' 1820 Constitutional Convention. Joseph Story, then a sitting Justice on this Court, explained that a proposed constitutional amendment requiring representatives to be elected in districts would violate the Elections Clause because that clause vested state legislatures ""with an unlimited discretion in the subject."" Justice Story's view was an echo of Alexander Hamilton's father-in-law, Senator Philip Schuyler, who took the exact same position on behalf of the entire New York State Senate just one month after the ratification of the Constitution. And for the first 140 years of the republic, there was not a single state court that invalidated on substantive grounds any congressional redistricting plan.

13586,2022.21-1271-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"Okay. So, if that's true, if it is the state's constitution that tells us who the legislature is and whether what they're doing is a valid exercise of legislative authority, then I guess what I don't understand is why constitutional limits on the exercise of that entity on its power don't still apply, even in this context. So, in other words, the Elections Clause says you get the right to make this decision, that you have that policy determination. But the state constitution is the thing that gives this particular entity its authority to make any determinations and the state constitution says things like, when you make a determination about things in your policymaking role, in the legislative power that we're giving you, you have to make sure that, you know, people are treated equally. You have to -- whatever the constitutional provisions are that we say -- that you're saying are so vague or whatnot, are limitations on that entity's legislative authority not just in this area but in every area whenever they undertake to make a law. And so I guess what I'm trying to understand is why are you suggesting that in the context of the Elections Clause, when this entity would ordinarily be bound by all of the limitations in the state constitution in its legislative authority role, why suddenly in this context do you say, no, no, no, all those other constitutional provisions that would bind or constrict legislative authority that the state gives you because you're the state legislature, right, why -- why do those evaporate in this world? I read it as though the state court is essentially saying our constitution authorizes you to be the legislature only insofar as you act in accordance with our constitution's tenets, and you haven't done that in this instance.

I -- I thought it was a -- a determination, a delegation of, you know, policymaking power in the sense of you get to make this decision. But the authority for that body, wherever it is, that's called the legislature, comes from the state because -- you know, that -- that was my example about we have two different entities in the state fighting. Who's the legislature, right? It's what the constitution of the state says that gives you the power, entity X, to be the one who is the legislature making this elections decision. If I'm right about that, then what is being delegated from the federal Constitution is not your power as a legislature, it is just delegating to you the decision about time, place, and manner, which is fine, but you have to do that consistent with the authority that you have as an entity to make legislative decisions, and that comes from the state constitution.","<speaker>David H.

The order under review did not authorize a sale under 363(b). The asset sale had already closed. Rather, the order authorized assumption and assignment of a lease under Section 365, with no additional payment to the debtor. It does not defeat any congressional limit on the Court's power to hold Transform to the position it took in the bankruptcy court. Finally, Transform's alternative argument that the lease's transfer deprived the appellate courts of jurisdiction to review the assignment order is confused on multiple levels.

I would think that would be the unfair, problematic, potentially unconstitutional reaching out to grab corporations, but, to the extent that the corporation, as you say, is agreeing voluntarily, knowingly, to do business in the state, I would think the state would have a very significant interest in making sure that its residents have a forum to bring their lawsuits.

All we have here is a lawsuit by a non-resident of Pennsylvania against another corporation that -- against a corporation that is a non-resident of Pennsylvania on a cause of action that arose outside of the State of Pennsylvania. And -- and, under the way this Court looks -- has interpreted general jurisdiction in Daimler, that would say that it would violate due process to hale my client before the Pennsylvania courts. The only basis on which the plaintiff argues you should ignore the precedent in Daimler is because there was a sheet of paper filled out by which my client registered to do business.

And, second of all, no other state has adopted a statute like this one for the -- at -- at any time within the modern memory of people. And so, therefore, this state -- this statutory scheme stands alone. So, to answer Justice Kavanaugh's question, is it alone? Yes.

Sturgis wants you to hold that this settlement extinguishes Miguel's separate and distinct rights to money damages under the ADA. You should reject that. I want to emphasize three points.

Exhaustion isn't required in cases like this one seeking only money damages, a remedy the IDEA does not authorize. Second, Miguel's settlement fully exhausted the IDEA procedures. Further exhaustion is unnecessary and it's futile because it would be pointless. Miguel has already received everything he's entitled to under the IDEA statute. And, third, the net effect of Sturgis's arguments here is to defy the IDEA's clear purpose. That purpose is twofold: one, getting kids a FAPE as quickly as possible, and, two, preserving their legal rights under other statutes and the Constitution. Sturgis puts these goals on a collision course with each other. In any given case, its rule will either disincentivize settlements and block immediate FAPE relief, or it will nullify rights under other statutes. That makes no sense.

Walker</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Lanham Act does not apply to Petitioners' use of trademarks in foreign countries because nothing in the Act provides the clear, affirmative, and unmistakable indication needed to overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality, especially as to foreign defendants, like Petitioners. The text of the statute never says it applies to uses of trademarks outside the United States.

Any argument that the Act extends -- departs from that longstanding principle would have to be based on especially compelling evidence. But, here, Hetronic International offers only the text definition of commerce, and this Court has repeatedly rejected the notion that commerce language is enough to extend the law to foreign conduct, even if that language otherwise invokes the full scope of the constitutional commerce power. International also invokes this Court's decision in Steele. But Steele, by its terms, addressed only the Act's application to U.S. citizens acting abroad.

I thought of it as use in domestic commerce meaning these items are circulating in domestic markets in a way that causes customer confusion. And if you think of it in that way, I think that you avoid some of these hypotheticals about internet, you know, manufacturer overseas -- advertising overseas that are just confusing people in the abstract in the United States, that the items have to be here, being used in commerce domestically, and that that's causing confusion.

Reed sued Goertz for a declaration regarding Chapter 64, but Chapter 64 governs only access to testing through Texas courts. It does not control Goertz's common law authority to agree to testing. A declaration regarding Chapter 64 against Goertz would neither affect Goertz's common law authority nor bind Texas courts. That mismatch deprives Reed of standing and forecloses his reliance on Ex parte Young. On the merits, everyone agrees that due process is the relevant constitutional right, and everyone agrees that Wallace supplies the presumptive rule. Reed's claim accrued when he had a complete and present cause of action. Though he formulated it somewhat differently in his complaint and his petition, the gravamen of Reed's claim now is that the Court of Criminal Appeals' decision violated due process. If so, Reed had a cause of action, and, therefore, his claim accrued no later than when the Court of Criminal Appeals issued its opinion and judgment because that opinion and judgment imposed the legal consequences on Reed that he says violated due process. The Wallace rule should apply here. It would respect comity by treating the CCA's judgment on a matter of state law the same that this Court treats its judgments as immediately effective. It would work regardless of how a given state structures its DNA post-conviction test -- testing regime. It would discourage prisoners from manipulating their accrual dates through motions practice in state courts. And, finally, it would supply an accrual date by which all litigants, including those serving non-capital sentences who have a strong interest in early -- in early resort to a federal forum, could predictably measure limitations.

And in the case of Article 64, the full run of the procedure includes the trial court and then the direct appeal, in a capital case, the direct appeal to the CCA, and then we can have this dispute about whether the petition for rehearing is included or not. But I don't understand why he could exit at the trial court stage because the way Article 64 is set up, to ensure that he's not deprived of a constitutional right erroneously, is to give him the opportunity to appeal to the CCA and let the CCA correct any mistake that the trial court has made.

So even if he has a full and complete cause of action after the trial court rules, which is what I understood you to say in response to Justice Barrett, do you dispute that in determining when the accrual date should be, when the statute of limitations runs, we look at all sorts of things, not just when ""an injury occurs,"" let's say that was the injury at the time? I guess what I'm worried about is the suggestion that the accrual date necessarily has to start from a moment in which you can identify an injury such as you have in this case when, in cases like McDonough and Manuel, the Court seems to suggest that the accrual date is set in light of other considerations, including the fact that in this case you would have parallel litigation if you set the accrual date early. In this case, it doesn't seem to make any difference in terms of helping the state because the litigation in the state court is going on, so it's not like they don't have notice that the person is interested in litigating this claim.

So I count four key differences between the two sections. First, there's no reference in Section 12 to registration; second, Section 12 clearly covers some unregistered shares because it ropes in Section 3 securities; third, Section 12 refers to sales not only by means of a prospectus but also by means of oral communication, which would suggest that we're outside the world of registration; and, fourth, Section 12 creates liabilities for sellers who had absolutely nothing to do with the registration statement, so the class of people who -- who might be liable is very different and is not connected to the registration statement.

Russell</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Everyone agrees that ""such security"" in Section 11 refers in some ways to the registration statement challenged as misleading. The question here is the precise nature of that relationship. Petitioners say ""such security"" refers exclusively to what they call registered shares. But the statute doesn't use that term or provide a definition for it, and neither do Petitioners. That might seem unnecessary because one would think that a registered share is one specified in the registration statement, but registration statements do not specify individual shares, as exemplified by the examples of Petitioner Butterfield's shares that we discuss in our brief. Instead, what registration statements do is they do not act at the individual -- at the level of individual shares. Instead, they act at the level of a public offering of securities, not shares, that is, the planned introduction of a group of fungible shares to the market at a particular time. The function of the registration statement is to provide the market the information it needs to value all of those fungible shares in that public offering. And the function of Section 11 is to provide investors confidence that they can rely on the integrity of that market price, even though some of those shares could have been sold in some other transaction without a registration statement. Accordingly, the better view is that ""such security"" in Section 11 refers to all of the shares in the public offering for which the registration statement was a prerequisite. Section 12 also uses the term ""such security,"" but unlike in Section 11, it has a direct grammatical referent, the security sold by means of a misleading prospectus. By its terms, that provision applies to a security, not a registered security.

Instead, they act at the level of a public offering of securities, not shares, that is, the planned introduction of a group of fungible shares to the market at a particular time. The function of the registration statement is to provide the market the information it needs to value all of those fungible shares in that public offering. And the function of Section 11 is to provide investors confidence that they can rely on the integrity of that market price, even though some of those shares could have been sold in some other transaction without a registration statement. Accordingly, the better view is that ""such security"" in Section 11 refers to all of the shares in the public offering for which the registration statement was a prerequisite. Section 12 also uses the term ""such security,"" but unlike in Section 11, it has a direct grammatical referent, the security sold by means of a misleading prospectus.

The question here is the precise nature of that relationship. Petitioners say ""such security"" refers exclusively to what they call registered shares. But the statute doesn't use that term or provide a definition for it, and neither do Petitioners. That might seem unnecessary because one would think that a registered share is one specified in the registration statement, but registration statements do not specify individual shares, as exemplified by the examples of Petitioner Butterfield's shares that we discuss in our brief. Instead, what registration statements do is they do not act at the individual -- at the level of individual shares. Instead, they act at the level of a public offering of securities, not shares, that is, the planned introduction of a group of fungible shares to the market at a particular time. The function of the registration statement is to provide the market the information it needs to value all of those fungible shares in that public offering. And the function of Section 11 is to provide investors confidence that they can rely on the integrity of that market price, even though some of those shares could have been sold in some other transaction without a registration statement. Accordingly, the better view is that ""such security"" in Section 11 refers to all of the shares in the public offering for which the registration statement was a prerequisite. Section 12 also uses the term ""such security,"" but unlike in Section 11, it has a direct grammatical referent, the security sold by means of a misleading prospectus. By its terms, that provision applies to a security, not a registered security. And the prospectus here is exactly the kind of document Gustafson held to be a prospectus within the meaning of Section 12. Congress expressly mentioned shares exempt under Section 3 because it had to, because Section 3 says Section 3 exempt shares are not subject to any of the provisions of the statute, including Section 12. Section 4 does not operate in that way. It exempts only from the specific registration requirement. As a consequence, there is no need for Congress to mention that. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2022

Prelogar</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: COVID-19 is the most devastating pandemic in our nation's history and it has caused enormous disruption and economic distress. Over the past three years, millions of Americans have struggled to pay rent, utilities, food, and many have been unable to pay their debts. To head off immediate harm for student-loan borrowers, two Secretaries across two administrations invoked the HEROES Act to suspend interest and payment obligations for all Americans with federally held loans. But, if that forbearance ends without further relief, it's undisputed that defaults and delinquencies will surge above pre-pandemic levels. So Secretary Cardona again invoked the HEROES Act to provide a measure of loan forgiveness to ensure that this unprecedented pandemic does not leave borrowers worse off in relation to their student loans. The states ask this Court to deny that vital relief to millions of Americans, but they lack standing to seek that result. They principally assert harm to a separate legal person, MOHELA, that could sue in its own name but has chosen not to do so, and the states' asserted harms to their tax revenues are self-inflicted and indirect. The states' bare disagreement with this policy is not the sort of concrete injury that Article III demands. On the merits, the states say the Act doesn't authorize the Secretary to ever forgive loan principal. But the Secretary's interpretation of this text is not just a plausible reading; it's the best reading. Congress expressly authorized the Secretary to waive or modify any Title IV provision in emergencies to provide financial relief to borrowers. Loan forgiveness is a paradigmatic form of debt relief, and the Secretary acted within the heartland of his authority and in line with the central purpose of the HEROES Act in providing that relief here.

It seems to me that the government's position must be that the HEROES Act permits but-for causation and it doesn't require proximate cause because the Secretary's memo also refers to things like Russia's invasion of Ukraine and, you know, inflation and other things that would -- well, I mean, the invasion of Ukraine has nothing to do with COVID, but the other things that would have a more attenuated relationship to COVID. So is that your position, it would be a but-for?","<speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: COVID-19 is the most devastating pandemic in our nation's history and it has caused enormous disruption and economic distress. Over the past three years, millions of Americans have struggled to pay rent, utilities, food, and many have been unable to pay their debts. To head off immediate harm for student-loan borrowers, two Secretaries across two administrations invoked the HEROES Act to suspend interest and payment obligations for all Americans with federally held loans. But, if that forbearance ends without further relief, it's undisputed that defaults and delinquencies will surge above pre-pandemic levels. So Secretary Cardona again invoked the HEROES Act to provide a measure of loan forgiveness to ensure that this unprecedented pandemic does not leave borrowers worse off in relation to their student loans. The states ask this Court to deny that vital relief to millions of Americans, but they lack standing to seek that result. They principally assert harm to a separate legal person, MOHELA, that could sue in its own name but has chosen not to do so, and the states' asserted harms to their tax revenues are self-inflicted and indirect. The states' bare disagreement with this policy is not the sort of concrete injury that Article III demands. On the merits, the states say the Act doesn't authorize the Secretary to ever forgive loan principal. But the Secretary's interpretation of this text is not just a plausible reading; it's the best reading. Congress expressly authorized the Secretary to waive or modify any Title IV provision in emergencies to provide financial relief to borrowers. Loan forgiveness is a paradigmatic form of debt relief, and the Secretary acted within the heartland of his authority and in line with the central purpose of the HEROES Act in providing that relief here.

17935,2022.22-506-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"All right. And -- and I also have a big-picture question about standing. You've been arguing that standing here would be a reach if we were to, for example, find that, you know, MOHELA somehow -- losses to it count for the purposes of the state based on established standing principles. And what I've been mulling and wondering is whether the same concerns about the political significance of this case that the Chief pointed to could be a reason for us to hold the line in terms of thinking about our standing doctrine and whether or not we should expand it in this area. I understood that the standing bar really, you know, as applied in a case like this, would allow the political branches to hash this out without interference, you know, from a torrent of lawsuits brought by states and entities and individuals who don't have a real personal stake in the outcome. And, in some ways, it's not unlike a case we heard last week where people were very concerned about, you know, lawsuits against tech companies and how they might hobble these companies if we allowed them to go forward. And I guess I have that same worry about the operation of the federal government and -- and its ability to govern. If we look at our standing doctrine in cases like this and we find that, you know, even the most minor state interest, a dormant fund that hasn't been, you know, funded or used by the state in 15 years, if that can be the basis for standing, I guess I'm concerned that we're going to have a problem in terms of -- of -- of the federal government's ability to operate.

MOHELA is a state-created and state-controlled public instrumentality that performs the essential public function of providing financial aid to Missouri students. The Secretary's program threatens to cut MOHELA's operating revenue by 40 percent. That will directly undermine MOHELA's ability to further its critical public purposes, and the state has standing to assert those harms. On the merits, this is a major questions case. A nearly half trillion dollar debt cancellation program is undoubtedly a matter of vast economic and political significance. It is also unprecedented. Never before has the HEROES Act been used to forgive a single loan. In addition, the Secretary here asserts a breathtaking power, to do anything that he thinks might reduce the risk of borrowers defaulting, even years after a national emergency arises. He needs clear congressional authorization for such power, but he doesn't have it here because the HEROES Act does not authorize this program. The Act permits the Secretary to waive or modify existing provisions because of a national emergency. It does not permit him to rewrite existing provisions to create a new program that covers 95 percent of borrowers and applies to them regardless of how the pandemic affected them. This Court should declare this program unlawful, and I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2022

Then there are a bunch of places that you can click to, and one is the schedule of events and the other is travel and hotel arrangements, and another is favorite things to do in town while you're here, and another is registry. So that's what most websites look like, yeah? And they're not particularly ideological and they're not particularly religious. They're not particularly anything, all right? And -- and then there's a tag line just like the tag line in this case about sort of who created the website or whose graphics and design and typefaces and so forth were used in the website.

She serves all people, deciding what to create based on the message, not who requests it. But Colorado declares her speech a public accommodation and insists that she create and speak messages that violate her conscience. This Court rejects such government-compelled speech.

Colorado agrees Ms. Smith creates speech, and the law undeniably affects her message. She's not asking this Court to create new law but to apply its precedent. Colorado first says this case is about a sale. It's not just about a sale. The state forces Ms. Smith to create speech, not simply sell it. Next, Colorado says it can compel speech on the same topic. But Ms. Smith believes opposite-sex marriage honors scripture and same-sex marriage contradicts it. If the government can label this speech equivalent, it can do so for any speech, whether religious or political. Under Colorado's theory, jurisdictions could force a Democrat publicist to write a Republican's press release. Colorado's last resort is to argue that it can at least compel the same expression. But even the same expression can mean different things, like a black sculptor who carves a custom cross to celebrate a Catholic baptism but not an Aryan church rally.

Because I also heard you suggest earlier that there's something different about race, maybe the person wouldn't sell to someone of a different race. So -- so suppose -- you say that photography is expressive. Can you give me your thoughts on a photography business in a shopping mall during the holiday season that offers a product called Scenes with Santa, and this business wants to express its own view of nostalgia about Christmases past by reproducing classic 1940s and 1950s Santa scenes. They do it in sepia tone and they are customizing each one. This is not off a rack. They're really bringing the people in and having them interact with Santa, children, because they're trying to capture the feelings of a certain era. But precisely because they're trying to capture -- capture the feelings of a certain era, their policy is that only white children can be photographed with Santa in this way because that's how they view the scenes with Santa that they're trying to depict. Now the business will gladly refer families of color to the Santa at the other end of the mall who will take anybody, but -- and -- and they will photograph families of color in other scenes -- other scenes, so they're not discriminating against the families. What they're saying is Scenes with Santa is preserved for white families and they want to have a sign next to the Santa that says ""only white children.""

They're not purporting to be a business for hire in -- in -- in any meaningful sense.

I thought that there really isn't that clear a distinction in a situation like this because your client is an artist for hire essentially. Yes, she does customize things, they're not off the shelf, but she purports to be a public accommodation providing customized things to anyone who pays her, except for people whose messages are those that she disagrees with. And I just don't know that I've ever seen that kind of scenario, even in the cases that you're talking about, because sort of what Justice Gorsuch was saying, it's -- it's relying on the implicit message that she does not want to convey by supporting this person. There's an explicit message in the actual work, but to the extent that actual work is identical to the -- to the work that she would otherwise sell to the gay couple except for their names, then she is implicitly saying, you know, by selling this, I'm going to be violating my own beliefs. So let me just ask you another quick hypo. So I -- I'm trying to understand the extent to which this matters that she's a speaker as opposed to a restaurant. So I sell food, and one line of products that I make is from scratch for particular customers that are based on my grandmother's cherished family recipes. My dearly departed grandmother was clear that she only wanted to provide this kind of nourishment for people who share our same religious heritage. So I call these products Grandma Helen's Protestant Provisions. And I sit with each customer who comes in and I hear about their faith and their family, and I customize the recipe for them after having this discussion. So the food is not expressive, right?

Here, the company seeks a pre-enforcement order allowing it to turn away all gay couples, even if, as we've discussed, the wedding website they request is identical to one the company would sell to a heterosexual couple. Granting such a license to discriminate would empower all businesses that offer what they believe to be expressive services, from architects to photographers to consultants, to refuse service to customers because of their disability, sexual orientation, religion, or race. The Free Speech Clause exemption the company seeks here is sweeping because it would apply not just to sincerely held religious beliefs, like those of the company and its owner, but also to all sorts of racist, sexist, and bigoted views.

But, when you have an artist for hire and people come to them and say here's what I'd like you to make, there's a question about whether what they make is their statement or the customer's statement. So, if it was clear that it was not their statement, let's say the gay couple comes and they say we want ""God bless this union"" on our website, and the web designer says that's fine, but you understand under our name at the bottom we say on every website we believe that marriage is only between one man and one woman and we're going to put that on your website?

But Ms. Smith believes opposite-sex marriage honors scripture and same-sex marriage contradicts it. If the government can label this speech equivalent, it can do so for any speech, whether religious or political. Under Colorado's theory, jurisdictions could force a Democrat publicist to write a Republican's press release. Colorado's last resort is to argue that it can at least compel the same expression. But even the same expression can mean different things, like a black sculptor who carves a custom cross to celebrate a Catholic baptism but not an Aryan church rally.

But Ms. Smith believes opposite-sex marriage honors scripture and same-sex marriage contradicts it. If the government can label this speech equivalent, it can do so for any speech, whether religious or political. Under Colorado's theory, jurisdictions could force a Democrat publicist to write a Republican's press release. Colorado's last resort is to argue that it can at least compel the same expression. But even the same expression can mean different things, like a black sculptor who carves a custom cross to celebrate a Catholic baptism but not an Aryan church rally.

So, you know, it -- what would you think of a holding that says that the First Amendment protects this designer's right to provide products that explicitly express her beliefs about marriage, so she absolutely has the right to say one man, one woman, in every website, and she has the right to refuse to say gay marriage is great in any website, but what she's really asking for in this case, I think, is the right to say the same thing, here's the wedding, it's at this place, et cetera, et cetera, but she's afraid that if she says it for gay people that that will be sort of like an implicit endorsement of their wedding, and so she wants to be able to protect against implicitly endorsing, right, in a way that we've never really recognized before in the same way, when it isn't really clear that that's her message, when we don't -- when an objective observer would know that she was really trying to do that?

20734,2022.22-148-t01,petitioner,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Blatt, I'm just wondering why you are making such a broad argument when there are pretty obvious narrower arguments available to you. So, for example, one could say that whether the Rogers test should exist, whatever its scope should be, this is an ordinary commercial product using a mark as a source identifier. In that case, whatever we might think about the Rogers test, that's far from the heartland of the Rogers test. The Ninth Circuit just made a mistake as to this. The end. Why wouldn't that be sort of the obvious or appropriate way to resolve this case if we were coming out your way?","<speaker>Lisa S.

After a four-day trial, the district court found both infringement and dilution. The Ninth Circuit erroneously reversed both holdings. As to infringement, the Ninth Circuit did not disturb the trial court's finding of likelihood of confusion. It instead reversed by applying an exception to the Lanham Act that the Second Circuit in Rogers versus Grimaldi invented for movie titles. Under Rogers, an expressive work is allowed to confuse as long as the use of a mark is artistically relevant and not explicitly misleading. But the Lanham Act has no exceptions for expressive works. It bars using marks for any goods when likely to cause confusion as to origin, sponsorship, or approval. Artistic relevance has nothing to do with confusion, and both implicit and explicit uses can confuse. Nor does constitutional avoidance justify Rogers. Rogers doesn't plausibly construe any text, and there are no First Amendment issues to avoid. Trademarks are ancient property rights that necessarily restrict speech to protect investment in goodwill and prevent consumer confusion, and parodies can be confusing. Now, as a practical matter, parodies won't confuse when differences in marks, markets, or message, typically ridicule, signal that the brand company didn't make the joke.

I'm just saying it's totally unnecessary in this case to think about that question or to get there. And I'll just add a little bit. The reason why every court of appeals has -- that has thought about this question has adopted something like Rogers is because there are cases which look really different from this case. There are -- you know, an art photographer does photographs using a Barbie doll, which is clearly meant to have some kind of expressive meaning and is -- is not an ordinary commercial product like this one and doesn't use the Barbie doll as a source identifier.

20736,2022.22-148-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"So -- so can I ask it this way? I -- I guess I'm trying to understand why it's atextual in your view to focus on this idea of use of a mark as a source identifier, because it seems to me that what you're describing as the problem is courts grappling with the degree of expressiveness of various items in terms of determining whether or not this art, Rogers, exception should apply. But I wonder whether the cleaner, more sort of consistent with the statute way of looking at it is to ask, is the artist using this mark as a source identifier, as the threshold, and, if they aren't, then I guess the Lanham Act doesn't apply because, as you said, the Lanham Act worries about confusion that arises from use of a mark as a source identifier. So, if they're not doing that, then there's no trademark problem. But, if they are, if they are doing that, if it's being used as a source identifier, then I suppose we get into all of the questions under the Lanham Act test as to whether or not there's trademark -- what's -- infringement.

As to infringement, the Ninth Circuit did not disturb the trial court's finding of likelihood of confusion. It instead reversed by applying an exception to the Lanham Act that the Second Circuit in Rogers versus Grimaldi invented for movie titles. Under Rogers, an expressive work is allowed to confuse as long as the use of a mark is artistically relevant and not explicitly misleading. But the Lanham Act has no exceptions for expressive works. It bars using marks for any goods when likely to cause confusion as to origin, sponsorship, or approval. Artistic relevance has nothing to do with confusion, and both implicit and explicit uses can confuse. Nor does constitutional avoidance justify Rogers. Rogers doesn't plausibly construe any text, and there are no First Amendment issues to avoid. Trademarks are ancient property rights that necessarily restrict speech to protect investment in goodwill and prevent consumer confusion, and parodies can be confusing. Now, as a practical matter, parodies won't confuse when differences in marks, markets, or message, typically ridicule, signal that the brand company didn't make the joke. But absent these features, pervasive copying and trading off a brand's goodwill tends to confuse. And survey results showing consumer confusion indicate that the parodist did too much copying and not enough distinguishing. As to dilution, the Ninth Circuit held that the exclusions for noncommercial use mean noncommercial speech. That holding renders neighboring exclusions superfluous, and it nullifies Congress's decision to limit the parody exclusion to uses other than as a designation of source. This Court should give noncommercial use its ordinary meaning, a use not involving the buying and selling of goods. I welcome your questions.</text>",2022

So let me -- let me ask you one question, which is, is it your view that expressive works can never confuse as to source or origin?
