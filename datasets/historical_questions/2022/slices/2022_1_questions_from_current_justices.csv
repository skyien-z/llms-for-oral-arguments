I understood their argument to be centered on something quite different. So let's just assume for the sake of argument that there isn't an issue about how many people you were going to detain but only a question about which ones you were going to detain. And the -- the problem that I see with your final memorandum is that Congress has established its own set of priorities and has said that certain categories of aliens must be detained, shall be detained. And the final memorandum says -- tells ICE officers don't do that. Don't detain anybody based solely on that person's criminal history.

There are certain -- you know, people who have been convicted of certain crimes. We have statutes where Congress says those people have to be detained. But that doesn't speak to the antecedent determination of whether or not to prosecute those people. I think the problem that I'm seeing with the state's argument is that they appear to be conflating Congress's mandates with respect to detention and Congress's statements with respect to removal and that the idea of 1226 -- 1226(c) is that once the determination has been made pursuant to prosecutorial discretion that you're going to remove someone, if those people fall into the particular criminal alien categories, they have to be detained for the purpose of that removal.

And so I guess, on both standing and to pick up on Justice Kagan's question, standing and merits, and the Chief Justice's questions as well, there's a tradition of not allowing people to challenge non-enforcement decisions. Linda R.S. stands as probably the lead precedent on that. And so too on the merits question, there is a tradition of reading statutes with -- against the backdrop of prosecutorial discretion that at least in the federal context is rooted in Article II and then Castle Rock talks about that background principle in the state context. Those two things together are both probably united by the fact that there are never enough resources or almost never enough resources to detain every person who should be detained, arrest every person who should be arrested, prosecute every person who's violated the law.

Petitioners call the states' standing illegitimate because -- because it is based on the costs states incur when Petitioners violate federal law. But such costs fall well within those held as sufficient in at least Massachusetts versus EPA and Department of Commerce. As this Court has recognized before, the states bear many of the consequences of federal immigration decisions. Those consequences fit comfortably in this Court's traditional Article III standing framework. On the merits, the final memorandum is unlawful for multiple reasons, most clearly because it treats Section 1226(c) as discretionary, while both this Court and every previous administration have acknowledged it as mandatory. Petitioners respond by appealing to resource constraints and their prosecutorial discretion, both of which are beside the point. The states do not claim the Petitioners must remove anyone in particular. Rather, Petitioners' detention obligations run only to -- arise before and after their decision to prosecute and run only to a small subset of this nation's illegal aliens. Finally, eliminating the APA's vacatur remedy would jettison nearly a century of administrative practice. When Congress empowered federal courts under Section 706 to set aside agency action, it authorized courts, consistent with pre-APA practice, to vacate unlawful rules, not merely to disregard them. This Court should not hold otherwise. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2022

Streett</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Title VII requires religious accommodations absent an undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. TWA versus Hardison violates the statute's promise that employees should not be forced to choose between their faith and their job. Hardison's de minimis test makes a mockery of the English language, and no party truly defends it today. Fortunately, Hardison's test is dicta as to Title VII, so the Court can and should construe ""undue hardship"" according to its plain text to mean significant difficulty or expense. But even if Hardison applied Title VII, its de minimis test lacks precedential force because it was barely considered by the Court, and its neutrality-based rationale has been devastated by Abercrombie. The government's new patchwork test is little better than Hardison's. It allows employers to deny accommodations far short of any fair meaning of ""undue hardship."" The government believes undue hardship arises whenever there is lost efficiency, weekly payment of premium wages, or denial of a coworker's shift preference. Thus, under the government's test, a diabetic employee could receive snack breaks under Title VII -- under the ADA but not prayer breaks under Title VII, for that might cause lost efficiency. An employee could receive weekly leave for pregnancy checkups but not to attend mass, for that might require denying a coworker's shift preference or paying premium wages. There's no reason religious workers should receive lesser protection than those covered by other accommodation statutes. We know a significant-difficulty-or- expense test works because several states, including New York and California, already apply that test for religious accommodations.

And it ultimately reduces to the claim that it was wrongly decided, which this Court has said over and over again is not enough in the statutory stare decisis context. Petitioner is also wrong about Hardison's effects. Lower courts and the EEOC have applied the ""more than de minimis cost"" language in light of Hardison's facts. That means that employers aren't required to regularly pay overtime wages or regularly operate shorthanded. But the EEOC's guidelines recognize that employers can be required to bear other costs, like infrequent payment of premium wages. And the burden rests at all times on the employer to demonstrate undue hardship with concrete evidence, not with speculation. Applying those principles, lower courts frequently deny undue hardship defenses. So there is no justification now to dispense with Hardison and discard all of that precedent. Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Barrett, you asked some questions about the facts here. The lower courts correctly found an undue hardship on these facts. Petitioner's job specifically required him to work on Sundays. Exempting him from work each and every Sunday would have violated his coworkers' contractual rights at the post office under that MOU as to how to allocate those undesirable Sunday shifts. And his absences created direct concrete burdens on other carriers, who had to stay on their shifts longer to get the mail delivered. That caused problems with the timely delivery of mail, and it actually produced employee retention problems, with one carrier quitting and another carrier transferring and another carrier filing a union grievance.

I guess one thing that -- that concerns me about your proposed approach is that, you know, as Justice Gorsuch said -- and that's why basically no one's defending this -- I mean, we have an amicus brief from Americans -- you know, Americans for Separation of Church and State saying that Hardison was wrong. Since no one's defending the test, and I feel like you're going back and you're rationalizing it and you're saying here's why what the EEOC has said is consistent with a more robust understanding of the de minimis test that Hardison announced, you know, here's this body -- I mean, are we supposed to go back and look at this body of 40 years of court of appeals' law and -- and assure ourselves that, in fact, it's consistent with this test. If this language, ""de minimis,"" has been leading courts of appeals astray, what is the point of -- of retaining that formulation of the standard, which everybody agrees has led courts of appeals astray?","<speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For almost 50 years, courts have applied Hardison when analyzing undue hardship under Title VII. A substantial body of case law has developed to guide that context-dependent analysis, and that case law provides meaningful protection to religious observants. Petitioner asks this Court to throw all that away and overrule Hardison. But he can't overcome the strong stare decisis weight this Court gives to its statutory holdings. His argument boils down to a claim that Hardison was wrong because it insufficiently protects religious employees. But that is a policy argument that he should direct to Congress. And it ultimately reduces to the claim that it was wrongly decided, which this Court has said over and over again is not enough in the statutory stare decisis context. Petitioner is also wrong about Hardison's effects. Lower courts and the EEOC have applied the ""more than de minimis cost"" language in light of Hardison's facts. That means that employers aren't required to regularly pay overtime wages or regularly operate shorthanded. But the EEOC's guidelines recognize that employers can be required to bear other costs, like infrequent payment of premium wages. And the burden rests at all times on the employer to demonstrate undue hardship with concrete evidence, not with speculation. Applying those principles, lower courts frequently deny undue hardship defenses. So there is no justification now to dispense with Hardison and discard all of that precedent. Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Barrett, you asked some questions about the facts here. The lower courts correctly found an undue hardship on these facts. Petitioner's job specifically required him to work on Sundays. Exempting him from work each and every Sunday would have violated his coworkers' contractual rights at the post office under that MOU as to how to allocate those undesirable Sunday shifts. And his absences created direct concrete burdens on other carriers, who had to stay on their shifts longer to get the mail delivered. That caused problems with the timely delivery of mail, and it actually produced employee retention problems, with one carrier quitting and another carrier transferring and another carrier filing a union grievance.

It is not the case, as I think people thought it was at Hardison, that it's -- you -- you can't treat people's religious exercise any better than anyone else. In other words, strict neutrality is -- is no longer understood to be the law. It was not the case when Hardison was decided that you had cases like Hosanna-Tabor and Espinoza and Carson saying there really is no Establishment Clause problem if you make accommodations for people's religious -- religious belief. So, if you're going to look at this under current law, it's not clear that those cases would come out -- Hardison, for example -- would come out the same way. In other words, if we're going to do this and say ""de minimis"" doesn't really mean de minimis, it means something more significant, and if you're trying -- if you're in the lower courts and you're trying to figure out, well, what exactly does that mean, you will, of course, have to take into account our religious jurisprudence as it exists today, right?","<speaker>Elizabeth B.

Prelogar</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For almost 50 years, courts have applied Hardison when analyzing undue hardship under Title VII. A substantial body of case law has developed to guide that context-dependent analysis, and that case law provides meaningful protection to religious observants. Petitioner asks this Court to throw all that away and overrule Hardison. But he can't overcome the strong stare decisis weight this Court gives to its statutory holdings. His argument boils down to a claim that Hardison was wrong because it insufficiently protects religious employees. But that is a policy argument that he should direct to Congress. And it ultimately reduces to the claim that it was wrongly decided, which this Court has said over and over again is not enough in the statutory stare decisis context. Petitioner is also wrong about Hardison's effects. Lower courts and the EEOC have applied the ""more than de minimis cost"" language in light of Hardison's facts. That means that employers aren't required to regularly pay overtime wages or regularly operate shorthanded. But the EEOC's guidelines recognize that employers can be required to bear other costs, like infrequent payment of premium wages. And the burden rests at all times on the employer to demonstrate undue hardship with concrete evidence, not with speculation. Applying those principles, lower courts frequently deny undue hardship defenses. So there is no justification now to dispense with Hardison and discard all of that precedent. Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Barrett, you asked some questions about the facts here. The lower courts correctly found an undue hardship on these facts. Petitioner's job specifically required him to work on Sundays. Exempting him from work each and every Sunday would have violated his coworkers' contractual rights at the post office under that MOU as to how to allocate those undesirable Sunday shifts.

A substantial body of case law has developed to guide that context-dependent analysis, and that case law provides meaningful protection to religious observants. Petitioner asks this Court to throw all that away and overrule Hardison. But he can't overcome the strong stare decisis weight this Court gives to its statutory holdings. His argument boils down to a claim that Hardison was wrong because it insufficiently protects religious employees. But that is a policy argument that he should direct to Congress. And it ultimately reduces to the claim that it was wrongly decided, which this Court has said over and over again is not enough in the statutory stare decisis context. Petitioner is also wrong about Hardison's effects. Lower courts and the EEOC have applied the ""more than de minimis cost"" language in light of Hardison's facts. That means that employers aren't required to regularly pay overtime wages or regularly operate shorthanded. But the EEOC's guidelines recognize that employers can be required to bear other costs, like infrequent payment of premium wages. And the burden rests at all times on the employer to demonstrate undue hardship with concrete evidence, not with speculation. Applying those principles, lower courts frequently deny undue hardship defenses. So there is no justification now to dispense with Hardison and discard all of that precedent. Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Barrett, you asked some questions about the facts here. The lower courts correctly found an undue hardship on these facts. Petitioner's job specifically required him to work on Sundays.

How would you deal with real property using your approach?","<speaker>Vincent Levy</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In RJR Nabisco, the Court held that private plaintiffs may sue under civil RICO for treble damages if they suffer a domestic injury. Considering the plain text, the Court's precedents, and the common law, it is clear that a civil RICO plaintiff is injured at its domicile. This makes sense. Congress legislated to address domestic concerns and to protect U.S. persons, and this bright-line rule ensures that U.S.-domiciled plaintiffs will have a right to sue under RICO. And, as a matter of comity, it avoids interference with the remedial schemes of foreign states. In response, Mr. Smagin appears to propose a variant on the Ninth Circuit's gestalt test, which considered the conduct of one of the 12 defendants in this suit and the situs of the plaintiff's property. But RJR already held that the focus of RICO's private right of action is the plaintiff's injury and not the defendant's conduct, and that -- that -- perhaps that is why Smagin here wishes to have the Court overrule RJR Nabisco. As far as the focus on the plaintiff's property, the statute, again, focuses on an injury to the person, not the property. And, regardless, the common law instructs that the nature of the property here being intangible, it's a judgment and a debt, it follows the person of the plaintiff creditor, and that is where it is located. So the injury here was in Russia and not the United States. Following the common law makes sense because it avoids the odd result of allowing a foreign plaintiff to bring a foreign judgment or award to the United States to create a domestic injury. Finally, it is clear that the decision below will be unworkable. The Ninth Circuit purported to apply the same test as the Third Circuit, and yet those two circuits split on nearly identical facts in Cevdet and the decision below.

Now, assuming that the -- I think the other side has a point that we have to find what the definition is of ""obstruction of justice"" or ""relating to obstruction of justice,"" all I can find is that in 1831, leading commentators, Blackstone and Kent, understood it to require a pending petition.

Congress reenacted the offense in 1948, explaining that it made no substantive change to the -- to the petition at the -- at the time of Pettibone. Then, in 1995, just one year before obstruction of justice was added to the INA list of aggravated felonies, the Court of -- the Court in Aguilar again required interference with a pending proceeding. Now you say some states in 1996 had expanded it not -- expanded the definition of ""obstruction of justice"" not to need a pending proceeding. But the majority of them still defined it that way. I look at how Congress used it, and in all of the federal Criminal Code, the fray ""relating"" -- phrase ""relating to obstruction of justice"" appears in just one other place, RICO Section 1961, and it specifically refers to 1503. That same provision refers to Section 1512 as relating to tampering with a witness. So Congress itself is now saying we think of obstruction of justice as something different than the other provisions. And if we read things the way you're saying, there's a lot that's superfluous in this statute.

One option would be to look to the common law and to this Court's decisions in Pettibone and Aguilar and say, well, that usually meant at common law traditionally that there was an ongoing proceeding, obstruction of justice was contempt of court, things like that. The other is to look at dictionaries and say, well, there's some linguistic grift in this concept, and when we speak casually, the gist of any kind of thing that impedes an investigation -- failure to report a crime, accessory after the fact, witness tampering -- they -- they sound sort of like obstruction of justice, and they would fall within a contemporary dictionary definition.

And it had further explained that any interference must have a close nexus to that pending proceeding. An offense that might or might not affect a proceeding is not obstruction. No persuasive authority supports abandoning this well-settled, well-bounded definition for something looser, like a purpose to interfere with the process of justice.

It would leave courts, lawyers, and noncitizens to guess whether a predicate offense might at some point interfere with some possible process of justice and thus be an aggravated felony.

Just one year earlier, this Court had reaffirmed its century-old holding from Pettibone: obstruction can only arise when justice is being administered. And it had further explained that any interference must have a close nexus to that pending proceeding. An offense that might or might not affect a proceeding is not obstruction. No persuasive authority supports abandoning this well-settled, well-bounded definition for something looser, like a purpose to interfere with the process of justice. And doing so would be contrary to the notice and administrability concerns of the categorical approach itself. It would leave courts, lawyers, and noncitizens to guess whether a predicate offense might at some point interfere with some possible process of justice and thus be an aggravated felony. Mr. Pugin's case demonstrates the overreach of this looser approach. Accessory after the fact is a distinct offense. It's being a party to another person's crime, not an esoteric variant of obstruction. It is not, so to speak, in the family. It is recognized in the common law, in every state, and in the federal Criminal Code as something different, and so it is too big a leap to decide Congress meant to list it as an aggravated felony when it chose words that are the name of a different crime. That kind of leap is the opposite of the interpretive restraint this Court uses in construing statutes with significant immigration and criminal consequences.

The question in this case is whether that different meaning or message should play a role, any role, in the fair use analysis. Our answer is yes. Warhol's transformative meaning puts points on the board under Factor 1 of the four-factor balancing test. Goldsmith and the Second Circuit say no. Warhol's new meaning is categorically irrelevant and can't be considered as part of Factor 1 or any other factor. I want to emphasize three points. First, the precedent supports us. Campbell unambiguously requires an examination of meaning or message. Google reaffirms that test and cites Warhol's Soup Cans as a paradigmatic example of when it's satisfied. Goldsmith's test is at odds with both cases. Second, our approach, unlike Goldsmith's, maintains a balance between protecting artists' rights to monetize their works and encouraging new and important follow-on expression. We give follow-on artists credit for innovation at Factor 1 while recognizing that Factor 4 and the other factors will sometimes cut decisively the other way. Goldsmith's necessity test, by contrast, upends that balance. It banishes transformative meaning from the equation altogether, and by doing so, it violates 107's text, contradicts precedent, and undermines copyright's key goal, promoting creativity for the public good. Finally, the stakes for artistic expression in this case are high. A ruling for Goldsmith would strip protection not just from the Prince Series but from countless works of modern and contemporary art. It would make it illegal for artists, museums, galleries, and collectors to display, sell, profit from, maybe even possess a significant quantity of works.

The question in this case is whether that different meaning or message should play a role, any role, in the fair use analysis. Our answer is yes. Warhol's transformative meaning puts points on the board under Factor 1 of the four-factor balancing test. Goldsmith and the Second Circuit say no. Warhol's new meaning is categorically irrelevant and can't be considered as part of Factor 1 or any other factor. I want to emphasize three points. First, the precedent supports us.

Goldsmith's test is at odds with both cases. Second, our approach, unlike Goldsmith's, maintains a balance between protecting artists' rights to monetize their works and encouraging new and important follow-on expression. We give follow-on artists credit for innovation at Factor 1 while recognizing that Factor 4 and the other factors will sometimes cut decisively the other way. Goldsmith's necessity test, by contrast, upends that balance. It banishes transformative meaning from the equation altogether, and by doing so, it violates 107's text, contradicts precedent, and undermines copyright's key goal, promoting creativity for the public good. Finally, the stakes for artistic expression in this case are high. A ruling for Goldsmith would strip protection not just from the Prince Series but from countless works of modern and contemporary art. It would make it illegal for artists, museums, galleries, and collectors to display, sell, profit from, maybe even possess a significant quantity of works.

Now that use -- you say on Factor 4 that it doesn't compete with the photograph, Goldsmith's photograph, but hard to see how not. They both sell photographs to magazines, and they both sell photographs to magazines to display Prince's -- Prince's vision or Prince's look.

But the statute -- and I think this is something that Justice Sotomayor has sort of focused on and to some extent Justice Thomas with his hypothetical. The statute seems to be looking at purpose at a -- in a different way, that it's saying the purpose is, are you using it for a commercial nature? Is it going in a magazine or is it going to a school?

Why are you doing this?","<speaker>Roman Martinez</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Both courts below agreed and Goldsmith doesn't dispute that Warhol's Prince Series can reasonably be perceived to convey a fundamentally different meaning or message from Goldsmith's photograph. The question in this case is whether that different meaning or message should play a role, any role, in the fair use analysis. Our answer is yes. Warhol's transformative meaning puts points on the board under Factor 1 of the four-factor balancing test. Goldsmith and the Second Circuit say no. Warhol's new meaning is categorically irrelevant and can't be considered as part of Factor 1 or any other factor. I want to emphasize three points. First, the precedent supports us. Campbell unambiguously requires an examination of meaning or message. Google reaffirms that test and cites Warhol's Soup Cans as a paradigmatic example of when it's satisfied. Goldsmith's test is at odds with both cases. Second, our approach, unlike Goldsmith's, maintains a balance between protecting artists' rights to monetize their works and encouraging new and important follow-on expression. We give follow-on artists credit for innovation at Factor 1 while recognizing that Factor 4 and the other factors will sometimes cut decisively the other way. Goldsmith's necessity test, by contrast, upends that balance. It banishes transformative meaning from the equation altogether, and by doing so, it violates 107's text, contradicts precedent, and undermines copyright's key goal, promoting creativity for the public good.

The copier has to explain why it needed and not just wanted to use someone else's expression. Here, Petitioner has never given any reason for copying Ms. Goldsmith's picture to commercially license Warhol's Orange Prince in 2016. Indeed, Warhol got the picture only in 1984 because Ms. Goldsmith was paid and credited. Petitioner responds Warhol is a creative genius who imbued other people's art with his own distinctive style. But Spielberg did the same for films and Jimi Hendrix for music. Those giants still needed licenses. Even Warhol followed the rules. When he did not take a picture himself, he paid the photographer. His foundation just failed to do so here. Petitioner argues adding new meaning is a good enough reason to copy for free. But that test would decimate the art of photography by destroying the incentive to create the art in the first place, and it's obvious why the multi-billion dollar industries of movies, music, and publishing are horrified. Petitioner's colloquial definition of the word ""transformative"" is too easy to manipulate. The act also gives creators and not copiers the right to make derivative works that transform the original into new ones with new meaning. If Petitioner's test prevails, copyrights will be at the mercy of copycats. Anyone could turn Darth Vader into a hero or spin off ""All in the Family"" into ""The Jeffersons"" without paying the creators a dime. I welcome your questions.</text>",2022

Roberts, Jr.","Counsel, in -- in what way is the government's position different from that of Respondents?","<speaker>Roman Martinez</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Both courts below agreed and Goldsmith doesn't dispute that Warhol's Prince Series can reasonably be perceived to convey a fundamentally different meaning or message from Goldsmith's photograph. The question in this case is whether that different meaning or message should play a role, any role, in the fair use analysis. Our answer is yes. Warhol's transformative meaning puts points on the board under Factor 1 of the four-factor balancing test. Goldsmith and the Second Circuit say no. Warhol's new meaning is categorically irrelevant and can't be considered as part of Factor 1 or any other factor. I want to emphasize three points. First, the precedent supports us. Campbell unambiguously requires an examination of meaning or message. Google reaffirms that test and cites Warhol's Soup Cans as a paradigmatic example of when it's satisfied. Goldsmith's test is at odds with both cases. Second, our approach, unlike Goldsmith's, maintains a balance between protecting artists' rights to monetize their works and encouraging new and important follow-on expression. We give follow-on artists credit for innovation at Factor 1 while recognizing that Factor 4 and the other factors will sometimes cut decisively the other way. Goldsmith's necessity test, by contrast, upends that balance. It banishes transformative meaning from the equation altogether, and by doing so, it violates 107's text, contradicts precedent, and undermines copyright's key goal, promoting creativity for the public good. Finally, the stakes for artistic expression in this case are high. A ruling for Goldsmith would strip protection not just from the Prince Series but from countless works of modern and contemporary art. It would make it illegal for artists, museums, galleries, and collectors to display, sell, profit from, maybe even possess a significant quantity of works. It would also chill the creation of new art by established and up-and-coming artists alike. These results are repugnant to copyright and to the First Amendment. You should reject them.

Goldsmith's test is at odds with both cases. Second, our approach, unlike Goldsmith's, maintains a balance between protecting artists' rights to monetize their works and encouraging new and important follow-on expression. We give follow-on artists credit for innovation at Factor 1 while recognizing that Factor 4 and the other factors will sometimes cut decisively the other way. Goldsmith's necessity test, by contrast, upends that balance. It banishes transformative meaning from the equation altogether, and by doing so, it violates 107's text, contradicts precedent, and undermines copyright's key goal, promoting creativity for the public good. Finally, the stakes for artistic expression in this case are high. A ruling for Goldsmith would strip protection not just from the Prince Series but from countless works of modern and contemporary art. It would make it illegal for artists, museums, galleries, and collectors to display, sell, profit from, maybe even possess a significant quantity of works.

Is that the formulation?","<speaker>Roman Martinez</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Both courts below agreed and Goldsmith doesn't dispute that Warhol's Prince Series can reasonably be perceived to convey a fundamentally different meaning or message from Goldsmith's photograph. The question in this case is whether that different meaning or message should play a role, any role, in the fair use analysis. Our answer is yes. Warhol's transformative meaning puts points on the board under Factor 1 of the four-factor balancing test. Goldsmith and the Second Circuit say no. Warhol's new meaning is categorically irrelevant and can't be considered as part of Factor 1 or any other factor. I want to emphasize three points. First, the precedent supports us. Campbell unambiguously requires an examination of meaning or message. Google reaffirms that test and cites Warhol's Soup Cans as a paradigmatic example of when it's satisfied. Goldsmith's test is at odds with both cases. Second, our approach, unlike Goldsmith's, maintains a balance between protecting artists' rights to monetize their works and encouraging new and important follow-on expression. We give follow-on artists credit for innovation at Factor 1 while recognizing that Factor 4 and the other factors will sometimes cut decisively the other way. Goldsmith's necessity test, by contrast, upends that balance. It banishes transformative meaning from the equation altogether, and by doing so, it violates 107's text, contradicts precedent, and undermines copyright's key goal, promoting creativity for the public good. Finally, the stakes for artistic expression in this case are high. A ruling for Goldsmith would strip protection not just from the Prince Series but from countless works of modern and contemporary art. It would make it illegal for artists, museums, galleries, and collectors to display, sell, profit from, maybe even possess a significant quantity of works. It would also chill the creation of new art by established and up-and-coming artists alike. These results are repugnant to copyright and to the First Amendment. You should reject them.

Fletcher</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For more than a century, Congress has made it a crime to encourage or induce certain immigration offenses. Mr. Hansen violated that statute by inducing noncitizens to reside in the United States illegally so that he could take their money in a fraudulent citizenship scheme. No one suggests that that conduct was protected by the First Amendment. But the Ninth Circuit invoked the overbreadth doctrine to facially invalidate this longstanding statute by giving the words ""encourage"" and ""induce"" their broadest possible meaning and sweeping in wide swaths of protected speech. Now we haven't argued that the statute would be constitutional if it swept that broadly. Our position here is that the statute need not and should not be read that way. Everyone agrees that in criminal law, the terms ""encourage"" and ""induce"" are terms of art that can refer narrowly to soliciting or aiding and abetting unlawful activity. And as nine dissenting judges explained below, text, context, and history confirm that the words carry that traditional meaning in the context of Section 1324. At the very least, that's a plausible reading of the statute that ought to be adopted under the canon of constitutional avoidance because it would eliminate any overbreadth concern. Prohibitions on soliciting or facilitating both criminal and civil violations have long been common and have never been thought to raise a First Amendment problem because, as the Court held in Williams, the First Amendment does not protect speech that is intended to induce or commence specific illegal activities. Now I acknowledge that it will sometimes be hard to draw the line between protected advocacy and unprotected solicitation, but that problem is not unique to Section 1324. Exactly the same issue can arise under any solicitation or aiding-and-abetting statute. And, more importantly here, that is not an overbreadth problem. As with other solicitation and aiding-and-abetting statutes, the possibility that some applications of Section 1324 might raise First Amendment questions may provide a basis for future as-applied challenges, but it does not justify facially invalidating the statute and preventing its application to plainly unprotected schemes like Mr. Hansen's.

No one suggests that that conduct was protected by the First Amendment. But the Ninth Circuit invoked the overbreadth doctrine to facially invalidate this longstanding statute by giving the words ""encourage"" and ""induce"" their broadest possible meaning and sweeping in wide swaths of protected speech. Now we haven't argued that the statute would be constitutional if it swept that broadly. Our position here is that the statute need not and should not be read that way. Everyone agrees that in criminal law, the terms ""encourage"" and ""induce"" are terms of art that can refer narrowly to soliciting or aiding and abetting unlawful activity.

At the very least, that's a plausible reading of the statute that ought to be adopted under the canon of constitutional avoidance because it would eliminate any overbreadth concern. Prohibitions on soliciting or facilitating both criminal and civil violations have long been common and have never been thought to raise a First Amendment problem because, as the Court held in Williams, the First Amendment does not protect speech that is intended to induce or commence specific illegal activities. Now I acknowledge that it will sometimes be hard to draw the line between protected advocacy and unprotected solicitation, but that problem is not unique to Section 1324.

The jury instruction it agreed to in this case, on JA 113, states exactly that. If the government fails to establish proper venue for any count, you must find the defendant not guilty as to that count. The government's position is that this result should somehow differ when an appellate panel reviewing a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal finds that the jury erred in its determination and there is insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction. Put another way, the government's position is that when a jury does its job correctly and acquits, a defendant may not be reprosecuted, but, when the jury fails to correctly discharge its duty, the government gets a do-over. That is what this Court in Burks called a purely arbitrary distinction. The government has no real explanation for that result. It anchors its view on what it describes as a settled and unbroken practice of permitting retrials when a jury acquits for lack of venue. But there was no such practice. At both the common law and at the founding, the government's failure of proof as to venue resulted in a general verdict of acquittal, which carried all of the ordinary consequences of an acquittal.

The government's position is that this result should somehow differ when an appellate panel reviewing a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal finds that the jury erred in its determination and there is insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction. Put another way, the government's position is that when a jury does its job correctly and acquits, a defendant may not be reprosecuted, but, when the jury fails to correctly discharge its duty, the government gets a do-over. That is what this Court in Burks called a purely arbitrary distinction. The government has no real explanation for that result. It anchors its view on what it describes as a settled and unbroken practice of permitting retrials when a jury acquits for lack of venue. But there was no such practice. At both the common law and at the founding, the government's failure of proof as to venue resulted in a general verdict of acquittal, which carried all of the ordinary consequences of an acquittal. The rule the government relies on is instead the one this Court squarely rejected in Ball, that a prosecutor was entitled to a second bite at the apple even after a general verdict of acquittal on any ground by challenging the insufficiency of the indictment in the first trial. But, if the framers rejected that rule for purposes of the Fifth Amendment, they absolutely would have done so for violations of the venue right. As Justice Story explained, the venue right was an area where the framers sought to leave as little discretion in the government's hands as possible. There is no reason to think that the framers would have singled out venue as the one issue that goes to a jury, but the government's failure of proof does not yield an acquittal but rather a do-over. At bottom, an insufficiency-of-the- evidence determination, whether by a jury, a judge, or an appellate panel, must lead to a judgment of acquittal. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2022

Petitioner got both of those remedies here. His contention here is that the Constitution requires an additional third remedy, which is immunity from reprosecution. But he hasn't identified a single word of the actual text of the Constitution that mandates that remedy. And we think centuries of prefounding history and precedent belie that contention. Now Petitioner mentioned this morning and in his briefing that juries are instructed to acquit a defendant if the government fails to prove venue, and he says that we haven't shown a founding era federal case in which a jury acquittal was followed by a retrial. I think that's a little bit of a strawman. A general verdict of acquittal always precludes retrial under double jeopardy principles. We have never contested that. But that's not this case. He was not acquitted by the jury. He was convicted. The question is what happens when a reviewing court determines that a conviction was obtained in the wrong venue. Of course, there's no founding era precedent on that because, as my friend mentioned, there was no right of appeal in federal criminal cases until 1889 for defendants and 1907 for the government. But Petitioner's case basically boils down to, from start to finish, a conflation of a jury's general verdict of acquittal and a reviewing Court's determination that a conviction was improper or the result of constitutional error. This Court has squarely rejected that conflation, including in Scott, which was one of the trilogy of double jeopardy cases decided the same day as Burks.

Petitioner got both of those remedies here. His contention here is that the Constitution requires an additional third remedy, which is immunity from reprosecution. But he hasn't identified a single word of the actual text of the Constitution that mandates that remedy. And we think centuries of prefounding history and precedent belie that contention. Now Petitioner mentioned this morning and in his briefing that juries are instructed to acquit a defendant if the government fails to prove venue, and he says that we haven't shown a founding era federal case in which a jury acquittal was followed by a retrial. I think that's a little bit of a strawman. A general verdict of acquittal always precludes retrial under double jeopardy principles. We have never contested that. But that's not this case. He was not acquitted by the jury. He was convicted. The question is what happens when a reviewing court determines that a conviction was obtained in the wrong venue. Of course, there's no founding era precedent on that because, as my friend mentioned, there was no right of appeal in federal criminal cases until 1889 for defendants and 1907 for the government. But Petitioner's case basically boils down to, from start to finish, a conflation of a jury's general verdict of acquittal and a reviewing Court's determination that a conviction was improper or the result of constitutional error. This Court has squarely rejected that conflation, including in Scott, which was one of the trilogy of double jeopardy cases decided the same day as Burks. And what the Court said in Scott was that, look, a general verdict of acquittal doesn't give reasons, and so we adopt a defendant-friendly categorical rule that a general verdict of acquittal is final and preclusive. That's not true when a court decides something. When a court decides something, the dividing line for whether retrial is or is not permissible is whether the legal basis for the ruling goes to factual guilt or innocence or criminal culpability, as Evans against Michigan said.

Your question presented suggests that it's stand-alone and you use that term.

It doesn't say highly compensated employees. When you look at the subparts of the regulation, they have a subpart for executive, a subpart for administrative, a subpart for professional, a subpart for computer. There's no subpart for highly compensated. And the government says highly compensated is actually just a subset of these other categories. It is the fact that, you know, a person who is in each of these other categories, with the exception of computers, has to be paid on a salary basis. And some of those people are going to be making much more than the $455 minimum. Those are the ones we'll call highly compensated for the purpose of 601 and allow them to have this shortcut through. So can you talk a little bit about why it is -- first of all, does Mr. Hewitt satisfy any of the other parts of this regulation? You hone right in on 601.

11473,2022.21-984-t01,petitioner,Ketanji Brown Jackson,"Yes. So, Mr. Clement, I've heard you say several times in various ways that you think the regulatory scheme is about ensuring a minimum amount and not the weekly guarantee, sort of hand waving the idea of weekly guarantee. And I want to posit something quickly and then ask you about a hypo. I want to posit that 602 and the salary basis is actually parallel to 604 in that they're both ensuring the minimum weekly amount. Under 602, you get it in the form of a salary, predetermined, coming to you no matter how much you work. Under 604, if your setup is not that, if you're not set up predetermined amount coming in weekly, the regulation guarantees that you still have this minimum weekly amount through 604, all right? That's how I see it. And let me tell you why you why I think it matters, because the regularity of a predetermined amount is how people pay mortgages. So I don't know or it doesn't really matter that he might get $100,000 over the course of the year. What he has to know is how much is coming in at a regular clip so that he can get a babysitter, so that he can hire a nanny, so that he can pay his mortgage. It's about, I think, the predictability and the regularity of payment. So let me ask you this hypothetical. We have a nurse who has -- does the covered functions and makes $455 for a 12-hour shift. That's about $38 an hour. Some weeks, this nurse is called in for one shift and makes the $455. Some weeks, he's called in for four shifts and makes $1820. He doesn't know -- because of the way his situation is set up, he doesn't know from week to week how much he's going to make. It just depends on how many shifts his supervisor asks him to work, and all that's guaranteed is at least one shift, right, for the predetermined amount of $455. So some weeks, he makes that. Some weeks, he makes more. But, if he doesn't work any shift, he doesn't get anything. I think that under your theory as you've articulated it, he would be a salary basis worker and would not be entitled to overtime for the weeks that he makes the -- does the four or five shifts. Am I right about that in terms of how you have set this up?","<speaker>Paul D.

Clement</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent earned over $200,000 a year and concededly performed executive functions in supervising a dozen or more workers. He likewise was guaranteed at least $963 in any week in which he worked a minute. He is thus exempt from the overtime laws under the specialized streamlined exemption for highly compensated workers set forth in Section 601. Respondent nonetheless insists that he's entitled to hundreds of thousands of dollars in overtime because his substantial pay was calculated based on a day rate and, in many weeks, his total compensation was much larger than his guaranteed pay and, thus, he flunked the test of Section 604(b) and its reasonable relationship test. But Section 601 incorporates only the salary basis test of Section 602 and not the separate minimum guarantee plus extra rules of Section 604. Indeed, at the very moment that Section 601 was promulgated, the agency broke apart Section 602 and Section 604. Section 601 has never incorporated this minimum guarantee plus extra rules of Section 604 for very good reason. Section 601 itself addresses the questions of extras on top of the minimum guarantee and addresses them in terms that are both duplicative of Section 604(a) and contradictory of Section 604(b). In particular, the -- Section 601 authorizes total compensation to dwarf the minimum guarantee in terms that Section 604(b) would deem unreasonable. Worse still, Section 604 looks unfavorably on compensation in excess of the minimum guarantee, while Section 601 looks at the same thing, compensation in excess of the minimum guarantee, and says that's precisely what makes you highly compensated and, therefore, exempt. Respondent's position would put the regulations on a collision course. It would ignore the streamlined nature of 601. And it would divorce the regulations from the statutory text.

But I think Justice Sotomayor's point is a bigger and broader one. I mean, we've had the attorney-client privilege for a long time, and until 2014, nobody ever suggested that the test that you're proposing is the right one. Everybody instead used the primary purpose test. Some used it explicitly, you know, this was one purpose, this was another purpose. Some didn't. But that was the nature of the test that they understood themselves to be applying constantly. And what Justice Sotomayor is saying is there's no particular evidence of confusion, nor is there any particular evidence of chill. Why would there be chill? Because, by definition, if there is a primary purpose that's non-legal driving the communication, somebody will make that communication because they have a non-legal primary purpose to do so.

Hansford</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The public has a right to every man's evidence.

Employees send e-mails with trial data showing that a drug caused a serious side effect during trial or evidence that a new design for a car will sharply increase the rate of failure for the car's brakes. Sensitive business conversations with engineers and technical advisors and sales staff have to happen, and when they do, they can be critical evidence in subsequent court proceedings. All agree that such information is not and should not be privileged. But where a client combines a business communication with a request for legal advice or just the presence of an attorney to spot issues, as Justice Kagan indicated, courts need a test to see if the communication is more the kind that is seeking legal advice or more the kind that doesn't need the protection of the privilege. And reason and experience points to the primary purpose test, which has been used, as the discussion this morning indicates, for decades by a huge body of state and federal cases and has been endorsed by commentators from Wigmore to Rice. And I think that body of evidence powerfully rebuts Petitioner's assertion that it's too hard to apply the primary purpose test is what courts have been doing. Instead, Petitioner introduces a so-called freestanding significant purpose test, which, in its reply brief and, again, repeatedly this morning, Petitioner acknowledges is merely a bona fide legal purpose test. Any non-pretextual legal purpose, no matter how minor, will do.

Fletcher</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the discussion so far illustrates, everyone agrees that the waters protected by the Clean Water Act include some adjacent wetlands. The narrow but important question presented in this case is whether wetlands lose protection if they're separated from other waters by a barrier like a berm or a road. Overwhelming scientific evidence and essentially undisputed scientific evidence shows that those sorts of barriers do not diminish wetlands' essential role in protecting the integrity of other waters. And as Justice Kavanaugh emphasized, for 45 years, the EPA and the Army Corps have recognized that the presence of such a barrier does not categorically strip a wetland of the Act's protections. This Court should uphold that longstanding interpretation for three reasons. First, in 1977, Congress was presented with proposals to limit the Act's coverage that sounded very much like the proposal that you just heard, and it rejected them. Instead, it adopted Section 1344(g), which includes express textual recognition that the waters covered by the Act include adjacent wetlands. The Court recognized in SWANCC, in the language that Justice Sotomayor quoted, that that was an unequivocal approval of the Corps's regulation on adjacent wetlands. Second, this Court unanimously upheld those regulations in Riverside Bayview. Now it's true that the marsh at issue in that case happened to directly abut a creek such that one could wade from one and then swim in the other. But the Court did not rely on any difficulty in identifying the boundary between the creek and the lake, and there wasn't one. Instead, the Court relied on what it called the agency's ecological judgment that wetlands significantly affect neighboring waters. And the presence of a berm or other barrier does not sever that connection. In fact, as the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Act emphasized, the presence of a river berm can itself be evidence of the close connection between the river and the neighboring wetlands. Third and finally, the agencies are now doing what members of this Court have repeatedly urged them to do by promulgating regulations that recognize and appropriately limit the coverage of the Act. Those regulations incorporate the significant nexus test, which is a limiting construction that ensures that the Act reaches only those wetlands that must be covered to reach the traditional navigable waters in which the federal interest is indisputable.</text>",2022

Is -- is -- is what you're doing trying to figure out how, other than by demanding strict contiguity, one defines adjacency, and then, you know, dealing with the hard issue of it just doesn't seem as though it should be 50 but not 51, but I think what the Chief Justice is asking you is, well, what do you look to then, you know, name the three things that matter when you're saying is something adjacent enough?","<speaker>Brian H. Fletcher</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the discussion so far illustrates, everyone agrees that the waters protected by the Clean Water Act include some adjacent wetlands. The narrow but important question presented in this case is whether wetlands lose protection if they're separated from other waters by a barrier like a berm or a road. Overwhelming scientific evidence and essentially undisputed scientific evidence shows that those sorts of barriers do not diminish wetlands' essential role in protecting the integrity of other waters. And as Justice Kavanaugh emphasized, for 45 years, the EPA and the Army Corps have recognized that the presence of such a barrier does not categorically strip a wetland of the Act's protections. This Court should uphold that longstanding interpretation for three reasons. First, in 1977, Congress was presented with proposals to limit the Act's coverage that sounded very much like the proposal that you just heard, and it rejected them. Instead, it adopted Section 1344(g), which includes express textual recognition that the waters covered by the Act include adjacent wetlands. The Court recognized in SWANCC, in the language that Justice Sotomayor quoted, that that was an unequivocal approval of the Corps's regulation on adjacent wetlands. Second, this Court unanimously upheld those regulations in Riverside Bayview. Now it's true that the marsh at issue in that case happened to directly abut a creek such that one could wade from one and then swim in the other. But the Court did not rely on any difficulty in identifying the boundary between the creek and the lake, and there wasn't one. Instead, the Court relied on what it called the agency's ecological judgment that wetlands significantly affect neighboring waters. And the presence of a berm or other barrier does not sever that connection. In fact, as the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Act emphasized, the presence of a river berm can itself be evidence of the close connection between the river and the neighboring wetlands. Third and finally, the agencies are now doing what members of this Court have repeatedly urged them to do by promulgating regulations that recognize and appropriately limit the coverage of the Act. Those regulations incorporate the significant nexus test, which is a limiting construction that ensures that the Act reaches only those wetlands that must be covered to reach the traditional navigable waters in which the federal interest is indisputable.</text>",2022

Fletcher</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the discussion so far illustrates, everyone agrees that the waters protected by the Clean Water Act include some adjacent wetlands. The narrow but important question presented in this case is whether wetlands lose protection if they're separated from other waters by a barrier like a berm or a road. Overwhelming scientific evidence and essentially undisputed scientific evidence shows that those sorts of barriers do not diminish wetlands' essential role in protecting the integrity of other waters. And as Justice Kavanaugh emphasized, for 45 years, the EPA and the Army Corps have recognized that the presence of such a barrier does not categorically strip a wetland of the Act's protections. This Court should uphold that longstanding interpretation for three reasons. First, in 1977, Congress was presented with proposals to limit the Act's coverage that sounded very much like the proposal that you just heard, and it rejected them. Instead, it adopted Section 1344(g), which includes express textual recognition that the waters covered by the Act include adjacent wetlands. The Court recognized in SWANCC, in the language that Justice Sotomayor quoted, that that was an unequivocal approval of the Corps's regulation on adjacent wetlands. Second, this Court unanimously upheld those regulations in Riverside Bayview. Now it's true that the marsh at issue in that case happened to directly abut a creek such that one could wade from one and then swim in the other. But the Court did not rely on any difficulty in identifying the boundary between the creek and the lake, and there wasn't one. Instead, the Court relied on what it called the agency's ecological judgment that wetlands significantly affect neighboring waters. And the presence of a berm or other barrier does not sever that connection. In fact, as the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Act emphasized, the presence of a river berm can itself be evidence of the close connection between the river and the neighboring wetlands.

Instead, it adopted Section 1344(g), which includes express textual recognition that the waters covered by the Act include adjacent wetlands. The Court recognized in SWANCC, in the language that Justice Sotomayor quoted, that that was an unequivocal approval of the Corps's regulation on adjacent wetlands. Second, this Court unanimously upheld those regulations in Riverside Bayview. Now it's true that the marsh at issue in that case happened to directly abut a creek such that one could wade from one and then swim in the other. But the Court did not rely on any difficulty in identifying the boundary between the creek and the lake, and there wasn't one. Instead, the Court relied on what it called the agency's ecological judgment that wetlands significantly affect neighboring waters. And the presence of a berm or other barrier does not sever that connection. In fact, as the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Act emphasized, the presence of a river berm can itself be evidence of the close connection between the river and the neighboring wetlands. Third and finally, the agencies are now doing what members of this Court have repeatedly urged them to do by promulgating regulations that recognize and appropriately limit the coverage of the Act. Those regulations incorporate the significant nexus test, which is a limiting construction that ensures that the Act reaches only those wetlands that must be covered to reach the traditional navigable waters in which the federal interest is indisputable.</text>",2022

As you're arguing the case in this Court, to win, we have to find that you're right about significant nexus, Justice Kennedy's position in Rapanos, because you're not really relying for purposes of this case on the 1344(g) adjacency language, is that correct?","<speaker>Brian H. Fletcher</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the discussion so far illustrates, everyone agrees that the waters protected by the Clean Water Act include some adjacent wetlands. The narrow but important question presented in this case is whether wetlands lose protection if they're separated from other waters by a barrier like a berm or a road. Overwhelming scientific evidence and essentially undisputed scientific evidence shows that those sorts of barriers do not diminish wetlands' essential role in protecting the integrity of other waters. And as Justice Kavanaugh emphasized, for 45 years, the EPA and the Army Corps have recognized that the presence of such a barrier does not categorically strip a wetland of the Act's protections. This Court should uphold that longstanding interpretation for three reasons. First, in 1977, Congress was presented with proposals to limit the Act's coverage that sounded very much like the proposal that you just heard, and it rejected them. Instead, it adopted Section 1344(g), which includes express textual recognition that the waters covered by the Act include adjacent wetlands. The Court recognized in SWANCC, in the language that Justice Sotomayor quoted, that that was an unequivocal approval of the Corps's regulation on adjacent wetlands. Second, this Court unanimously upheld those regulations in Riverside Bayview. Now it's true that the marsh at issue in that case happened to directly abut a creek such that one could wade from one and then swim in the other. But the Court did not rely on any difficulty in identifying the boundary between the creek and the lake, and there wasn't one. Instead, the Court relied on what it called the agency's ecological judgment that wetlands significantly affect neighboring waters. And the presence of a berm or other barrier does not sever that connection. In fact, as the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Act emphasized, the presence of a river berm can itself be evidence of the close connection between the river and the neighboring wetlands.

And then, to follow up on Justice Alito's points about waters of the United States, if we put aside 1344(g) for a moment, and we're thinking about significant nexus, you know, Justice Thomas says he grew up in the low country of Georgia, and I grew up in New Orleans. The whole thing is below sea level. So, you know, there are aquifers that run right underneath it. You -- we have no basements because, you dig far enough in anybody's yard, you hit water, and all of that runs into Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River, navigable waters.

He must remain in prison despite having done nothing wrong. But, as this Court held in Davis, conviction and punishment for an act that the law does not make criminal inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice. The Eighth Circuit's ruling is wrong for four separate reasons. First, it violates the text of 2255(e). Its key terms all indicate that traditional habeas relief should be available, that a prisoner should have one opportunity to have the correct law applied to his case. The Eighth Circuit held, however, that so long as 2255 provides a purely formal opportunity to raise an issue, it doesn't matter whether the law applied is correct or wrong. Prisoners in this situation, moreover, do not even have that purely formal opportunity. They will almost always be barred from raising the issue in their initial 2255 motion. Second, the Eighth Circuit made the savings clause almost completely superfluous. It identified two categories of cases where it believed the saving clause applies. But the savings clause actually applies to neither. In both situations, the prisoner petitions under 2241 directly. Third, the Eighth Circuit created four independent constitutional difficulties. It effectively suspended an important use of the writ as originally understood, and it raised substantial due process, separation of powers, and Eighth Amendment concerns. It denied Jones any opportunity to ever test his claim under what has always been the correct law. Finally, the Eighth Circuit wrongly concluded that allowing savings clause relief would undermine Section 2255(h). It does not.

But, as this Court held in Davis, conviction and punishment for an act that the law does not make criminal inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice. The Eighth Circuit's ruling is wrong for four separate reasons. First, it violates the text of 2255(e). Its key terms all indicate that traditional habeas relief should be available, that a prisoner should have one opportunity to have the correct law applied to his case. The Eighth Circuit held, however, that so long as 2255 provides a purely formal opportunity to raise an issue, it doesn't matter whether the law applied is correct or wrong. Prisoners in this situation, moreover, do not even have that purely formal opportunity. They will almost always be barred from raising the issue in their initial 2255 motion. Second, the Eighth Circuit made the savings clause almost completely superfluous. It identified two categories of cases where it believed the saving clause applies. But the savings clause actually applies to neither. In both situations, the prisoner petitions under 2241 directly. Third, the Eighth Circuit created four independent constitutional difficulties. It effectively suspended an important use of the writ as originally understood, and it raised substantial due process, separation of powers, and Eighth Amendment concerns. It denied Jones any opportunity to ever test his claim under what has always been the correct law. Finally, the Eighth Circuit wrongly concluded that allowing savings clause relief would undermine Section 2255(h). It does not. The saving clause and 2255(h) are independent, congressionally authorized routes to collateral review, and nothing suggests that in enacting Section 2255(h) in 1996 Congress intended to repeal the savings clause. The Eighth Circuit's repeal by implication isn't justified. Your Honors, the Eighth Circuit here moved that because the prisoner had a theoretical right to raise an opportunity -- had the right to raise an opportunity in his initial 2255 motion, which was for -- which substantively was foreclosed under existing circuit precedent, which this Court later declared wrong, the possibility of en banc review or a cert petition to this Court made his quest to have the correct law applied real.

He must remain in prison despite having done nothing wrong. But, as this Court held in Davis, conviction and punishment for an act that the law does not make criminal inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice. The Eighth Circuit's ruling is wrong for four separate reasons. First, it violates the text of 2255(e). Its key terms all indicate that traditional habeas relief should be available, that a prisoner should have one opportunity to have the correct law applied to his case. The Eighth Circuit held, however, that so long as 2255 provides a purely formal opportunity to raise an issue, it doesn't matter whether the law applied is correct or wrong. Prisoners in this situation, moreover, do not even have that purely formal opportunity. They will almost always be barred from raising the issue in their initial 2255 motion. Second, the Eighth Circuit made the savings clause almost completely superfluous. It identified two categories of cases where it believed the saving clause applies. But the savings clause actually applies to neither. In both situations, the prisoner petitions under 2241 directly. Third, the Eighth Circuit created four independent constitutional difficulties. It effectively suspended an important use of the writ as originally understood, and it raised substantial due process, separation of powers, and Eighth Amendment concerns. It denied Jones any opportunity to ever test his claim under what has always been the correct law. Finally, the Eighth Circuit wrongly concluded that allowing savings clause relief would undermine Section 2255(h). It does not. The saving clause and 2255(h) are independent, congressionally authorized routes to collateral review, and nothing suggests that in enacting Section 2255(h) in 1996 Congress intended to repeal the savings clause. The Eighth Circuit's repeal by implication isn't justified. Your Honors, the Eighth Circuit here moved that because the prisoner had a theoretical right to raise an opportunity -- had the right to raise an opportunity in his initial 2255 motion, which was for -- which substantively was foreclosed under existing circuit precedent, which this Court later declared wrong, the possibility of en banc review or a cert petition to this Court made his quest to have the correct law applied real.

He must remain in prison despite having done nothing wrong. But, as this Court held in Davis, conviction and punishment for an act that the law does not make criminal inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice. The Eighth Circuit's ruling is wrong for four separate reasons. First, it violates the text of 2255(e). Its key terms all indicate that traditional habeas relief should be available, that a prisoner should have one opportunity to have the correct law applied to his case. The Eighth Circuit held, however, that so long as 2255 provides a purely formal opportunity to raise an issue, it doesn't matter whether the law applied is correct or wrong. Prisoners in this situation, moreover, do not even have that purely formal opportunity. They will almost always be barred from raising the issue in their initial 2255 motion. Second, the Eighth Circuit made the savings clause almost completely superfluous. It identified two categories of cases where it believed the saving clause applies. But the savings clause actually applies to neither. In both situations, the prisoner petitions under 2241 directly. Third, the Eighth Circuit created four independent constitutional difficulties. It effectively suspended an important use of the writ as originally understood, and it raised substantial due process, separation of powers, and Eighth Amendment concerns. It denied Jones any opportunity to ever test his claim under what has always been the correct law. Finally, the Eighth Circuit wrongly concluded that allowing savings clause relief would undermine Section 2255(h). It does not. The saving clause and 2255(h) are independent, congressionally authorized routes to collateral review, and nothing suggests that in enacting Section 2255(h) in 1996 Congress intended to repeal the savings clause.

What I'm still not so clear on is why 2555 could not be working if, because of one of its provisions, it's, you know, unconstitutional or it doesn't allow you or doesn't allow for actually innocent people to have one clear shot at relief. Like why isn't that a species of 2255 is not working and, therefore, you need to be in the habeas lane?","<speaker>Daniel R. Ortiz</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Eighth Circuit ruled in this case that someone in prison for something the court later determines has never been a crime has no means to challenge his continued detention once his opportunity to file a 2255 motion runs out. He must remain in prison despite having done nothing wrong. But, as this Court held in Davis, conviction and punishment for an act that the law does not make criminal inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice. The Eighth Circuit's ruling is wrong for four separate reasons. First, it violates the text of 2255(e). Its key terms all indicate that traditional habeas relief should be available, that a prisoner should have one opportunity to have the correct law applied to his case. The Eighth Circuit held, however, that so long as 2255 provides a purely formal opportunity to raise an issue, it doesn't matter whether the law applied is correct or wrong. Prisoners in this situation, moreover, do not even have that purely formal opportunity. They will almost always be barred from raising the issue in their initial 2255 motion. Second, the Eighth Circuit made the savings clause almost completely superfluous. It identified two categories of cases where it believed the saving clause applies. But the savings clause actually applies to neither. In both situations, the prisoner petitions under 2241 directly. Third, the Eighth Circuit created four independent constitutional difficulties. It effectively suspended an important use of the writ as originally understood, and it raised substantial due process, separation of powers, and Eighth Amendment concerns. It denied Jones any opportunity to ever test his claim under what has always been the correct law. Finally, the Eighth Circuit wrongly concluded that allowing savings clause relief would undermine Section 2255(h). It does not. The saving clause and 2255(h) are independent, congressionally authorized routes to collateral review, and nothing suggests that in enacting Section 2255(h) in 1996 Congress intended to repeal the savings clause.

In this case, the prosecution substituted phrases like ""the other person"" for Petitioner's name, but, having done that, the prosecution used the confession functionally to identify Petitioner. The prosecution's questioning of the agent who took the confession left little doubt that the confessing defendant had named ""the other person."" Petitioner was the only defendant who plausibly could have been ""the other person."" The prosecution described the confession as some of the most crucial testimony in the case, and having elicited detailed testimony that ""the other person"" had met up and lived with the confessing defendant, the prosecution proceeded to present evidence that Petitioner had done just that. In light of those considerations, it is likely, indeed, inevitable, that the jury inferred that the confession here implicated Petitioner. In applying the Bruton rule, lower courts have considered the broader context without any evident difficulty, and doing so appropriately protects a defendant's confrontation right while working minimal prejudice to the government. The government's alternative approach would draw arbitrary and formalistic distinctions and permit ready circumvention of the Bruton rule, as this case illustrates. If Bruton is to mean anything, Petitioner is entitled to a new trial without the introduction of the unconfronted confession. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2022

This Court has made clear that the Bruton rule applies to a confession that has been redacted to avoid naming another defendant where the jury is likely to infer that the confession implicated that defendant. The question presented today is whether the manner in which the redaction is carried out is dispositive of the application of the Bruton rule. The Court should hold that it is not. In this case, the prosecution substituted phrases like ""the other person"" for Petitioner's name, but, having done that, the prosecution used the confession functionally to identify Petitioner. The prosecution's questioning of the agent who took the confession left little doubt that the confessing defendant had named ""the other person."" Petitioner was the only defendant who plausibly could have been ""the other person."" The prosecution described the confession as some of the most crucial testimony in the case, and having elicited detailed testimony that ""the other person"" had met up and lived with the confessing defendant, the prosecution proceeded to present evidence that Petitioner had done just that. In light of those considerations, it is likely, indeed, inevitable, that the jury inferred that the confession here implicated Petitioner. In applying the Bruton rule, lower courts have considered the broader context without any evident difficulty, and doing so appropriately protects a defendant's confrontation right while working minimal prejudice to the government. The government's alternative approach would draw arbitrary and formalistic distinctions and permit ready circumvention of the Bruton rule, as this case illustrates.

But this Court has taken care to treat the Bruton exception as narrow and it has repeatedly declined to extend it. The Court should decline Petitioner's request here too. First, confessions that replace a defendant's name with a natural-sounding noun or pronoun do not give rise to an overwhelming probability of juror disobedience.

It's like, yeah, Richardson talks about some inferences. But it says the inferences at issue here involve statements that, despite redaction, obviously refer directly to someone, often, obviously, the defendant, and which involve inferences that a jury ordinarily could make immediately, even were the confession the very first item introduced at trial. And what I'm suggesting is that there are cases like that. You could have a very high bar as to how immediate or how strong the inference has to be, but acknowledge that, look, I mean, it just -- you know, you can't take the law seriously when it says, ""[redacted] and I went out and robbed Bill"" is inadmissible, but ""the woman and I went out and robbed Bill"" can be brought in.","<speaker>Caroline A.

12661,2022.22-196-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Isn't it true that there are two analytically pure, conceptually pure ways in which the fundamental issue here could be addressed? One -- but they both have their practical problems. One is to say, as was previously the rule, that if the jury is instructed to consider it only against the person who confessed, that cures the problem. The other is to recognize that this issue is never going to arise unless there is some risk or some reason to fear that the confession is going to be held by the jury against the nontestifying co-defendant because they just can't put that out of their minds. It's not realistic to expect them to do that. So those are -- if you -- you take either of those positions, you've got a -- you've got a clear rationale. But the Court has not done that. It has drawn lines between these two poles. And so it may be artificial to expect that when you draw that line, it's always going to be able to say why did you draw it there, because the rationale could push you further or it could push you back. So there hasn't been that much discussion here today about why -- both -- both are -- both of those -- the rejection of both of those is based on essentially practical concerns because, one -- one, it -- it was found in Bruton and the subsequent -- and in Gray to present too much of a risk for the defendant. And the other, I think, leads you to the conclusion you just can't have joint trials whenever this issue pops up. So why draw the line -- unless we're going to go to one extreme or the other, there's got to be a line.

But this Court has taken care to treat the Bruton exception as narrow and it has repeatedly declined to extend it. The Court should decline Petitioner's request here too. First, confessions that replace a defendant's name with a natural-sounding noun or pronoun do not give rise to an overwhelming probability of juror disobedience. As this Court already reasoned in Richardson and reaffirmed in Gray, confessions that incriminate another defendant only inferentially through potential connections to other evidence at trial do not qualify for Bruton's prophylactic treatment. In fact, as has been discussed this morning already, this Court already approved of a confession like this in Gray, one that was modified there to refer to other guys who also committed the crime alongside the confessing defendant. And Petitioner's surrounding context test gives rise to the same practical problems that this Court already identified in Richardson and deemed intolerable: pretrial discovery proceedings, the risk of appellate reversals under a totality-of-the-circumstances standard, and the reality that, to avoid these problems, prosecutors will often be forced to forego confessions for joint trials.

12671,2022.22-196-t01,respondent,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"-- Gray and Richardson and try to -- to parse this if we're going to try to give credence to both cases, as Justice Sotomayor rightly says. So, at the top of 196, Gray says: Richardson's inferences involve statements that did not refer directly to the defendant himself and which became incriminating only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial. Okay? So then -- then it goes on and says -- Gray goes on to say here's how we're going to distinguish Richardson. At least I read these as the two key sentences: ""The inferences at issue here involve statements that, despite redaction, obviously refer directly to someone, often, obviously, the defendant, and which involve inferences that a jury ordinarily could make immediately even were the confession the very first item introduced at trial. Moreover, the redacted confession with the blank prominent on its face in Richardson's words facially incriminates the co-defendant."" So I guess my -- in reading that, I mean, it seems like Gray itself doesn't -- you know, those two sentences in Gray itself, I think, make clear that you can't look at -- make the kind of contextual inference that -- that Petitioner is talking about here.

Flynn</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If the jury is instructed not to consider a piece of evidence against a criminal defendant and the jury follows that instruction, then there is no Confrontation Clause problem. This follows from the bedrock principle underlying all jury trials in our legal system. The Bruton exception to that principle simply holds that when it comes to a discrete category of statements, testimonial confessions by co-defendants that expressly name another defendant or are otherwise facially incriminating, we will no longer presume that the jury can obey that instruction. But this Court has taken care to treat the Bruton exception as narrow and it has repeatedly declined to extend it. The Court should decline Petitioner's request here too. First, confessions that replace a defendant's name with a natural-sounding noun or pronoun do not give rise to an overwhelming probability of juror disobedience. As this Court already reasoned in Richardson and reaffirmed in Gray, confessions that incriminate another defendant only inferentially through potential connections to other evidence at trial do not qualify for Bruton's prophylactic treatment. In fact, as has been discussed this morning already, this Court already approved of a confession like this in Gray, one that was modified there to refer to other guys who also committed the crime alongside the confessing defendant. And Petitioner's surrounding context test gives rise to the same practical problems that this Court already identified in Richardson and deemed intolerable: pretrial discovery proceedings, the risk of appellate reversals under a totality-of-the-circumstances standard, and the reality that, to avoid these problems, prosecutors will often be forced to forego confessions for joint trials. As this Court has put it, that price is too high. Petitioner's unprincipled standard will invite erosion of the jury instruction presumption, lacks support in the common law, and will create significant problems for the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts as well as state courts across the country.

12722,2022.21-1599-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas,You said that the IRS is not reading the entire -- entirety of the clauses. Would you tell us exactly what you're relying on?,"<speaker>Shay Dvoretzky</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress enacted Section 7609 to give the public critical privacy rights to notice and an opportunity to quash third-party IRS summonses. Congress carefully limited the exceptions to those rights. In clause (1), Congress allowed the IRS to forgo notice for a summons issued ""in aid of the collection of an assessment against the person with respect to whose liability the summons is issued."" In clause (2), Congress separately dispensed with notice for summonses ""issued in aid of the collection of the liability of any transferee or fiduciary of a delinquent taxpayer with an assessment or judgment."" But the Sixth Circuit, like the IRS, nullified most of what Congress wrote. It read clause (1) to contain just nine words, a summons ""issued in aid of the collection of an assessment."" Period. The IRS says those nine words mean that anytime it's made an assessment, there are no judicially reviewable limits on its power to issue secret, overbroad, third-party summonses. So nothing stops the IRS from secretly summonsing all unredacted bank records of anyone who ever received money from a delinquent taxpayer: a lawn care company, a friend splitting a dinner check through Venmo, or, as here, a law firm. Never mind clause (2). Never mind the rest of the words in clause (1). Never mind the different language Congress used in another exception for summonses issued ""in connection with"" a criminal investigation. The Sixth Circuit and IRS's interpretation is inconsistent with the statute's text, context, and purpose, and it would create the same opportunity for abuse that Congress sought to eradicate. The question isn't whether the IRS can summons the records it needs, only whether it can do so secretly and without judicial oversight. The IRS says trust us, we police ourselves. But Congress repudiated that approach when it enacted Section 7609's privacy protections for innocent third parties. I welcome the Court's questions.</text>",2022
