That is talking about enforcing the civil contempt fines once they have been imposed and reduced to judgment. That is not the reason the judge imposed these prospective sanctions in the first place. The record is quite clear. The judge said this is to get you to comply. He said I sincerely hope this will deter future violations. The passage Your Honor was reading from concerns after this case, the union and the company had settled. At that point does the court have to, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, vacate the previously imposed fines already reduced to judgment? And the answer is no, because these are court orders and those are not at the disposal of the parties. The--","<speaker>Laurence E. Gold</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case grows out of a strike and ensuing equity proceeding to enjoin various kinds of wrongdoing and a series of contempt proceedings which have generated huge fines. The essential first question posed by the case is whether this... these fines were criminal fines which could only be imposed through criminal contempt and through procedures which meet the requirements of criminal due process, most particularly the right to jury. This is not a new question in this Court, and we rely on statements of the essential rules going back to 1911 in the Gompers case, and rules which have been restated and reaffirmed as recently as the Fiat case in 485 U.S.--</text>",1993
29421,1993.92-1625-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","--No, it's... the trial court quite clearly spelled out... and they're set forth in our brief... whenever he imposed these sanctions, that this is civil contempt, it is to get you to comply, if you comply you will not incur any fines whatever. They did not comply, they violated the order, and then the promised sanction was imposed. Now at that point the court's authority is implicated. Is its fine going to be enforced or not, or is it going to be something that the union and the company can bargain about between themselves? To come in and say, when the judge says I have entered sanctions fining you this much, pay... and the union is going to stand up and say, well, no, Your Honor, we've sort of worked that out between ourselves. At that point the court's authority to enforce its previously imposed judgments is implicated.","<speaker>Laurence E.

29422,1993.92-1625-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","--I don't know that the old common law had a situation where there was such widespread organized flouting of a court injunction. I'm not aware of that situation coming up. And the question is in such a situation, is the court powerless to use its civil contempt powers to enforce compliance with its orders; is its only recourse punishment later on? Take the situation of a company that's dumping dioxin in the city water supply, and an injunction is issued and the company is still doing it. The union would say that all that the court can do is somewhere down the road punish the company for that.","<speaker>Laurence E.
