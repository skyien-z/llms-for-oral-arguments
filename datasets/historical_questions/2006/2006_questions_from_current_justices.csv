Salmons</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. The FLSA's companionship services exemption applies by its terms to any employee employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services for the aged or infirm. The Act imposes no limitation based on the identity of the employer. And the Agency's regulation of 552.109 extending the exception to employees of third parties is entitled to deference. The Department expressly invoked its statutory rulemaking authority in adopting Section 109,-- 552.109. It utilized ed notice and comment rulemaking procedures both in 1975 and each time it considered amending the regulation. And States and care providers have relied upon it in devising systems to provide appropriate services to the aged and the infirm.</text>",2006

And I think that has two important implications for this case. First of all, when the Department has filled in the details, after notice and comment rulemaking, its regulations should receive Chevron deference as long as they are permissible implementation of the statute. Second, and particularly specific to this case, if there are ambiguities in the regulations, or as we have here, an apparent facial inconsistency, the court should accept the Secretary's resolution of that ambiguity provided that it is a reasonable one. And here we submit it's not only a reasonable one, it is by far the most sensible one. Now I'd actually like to turn, if I may, to the second issue first, because I think that's the source of a lot of the concern in this case. Plainly the two regulations, section 10... 552.109(a), which is the regulation directly at issue before this Court, and 552.3, which is the regulation relied on heavily by the Second Circuit to strike down the present regulation, have some inconsistency between them. But it is also plain that the Department could not have intended to say at one and the same time that the only employers entitled use the exemption were homeowners and then say in another section promulgated at the same time that also third-party employers are entitled to the exemption. So the question is, how does one resolve this apparent inconsistency? And the Secretary says, well, the only regulation that we promulgated that, in fact, deals specifically with the issue of third-party employment is 552.109(a), which is in fact headed Third-Party Employment.

The statute does not limit the union's ability to spend its own money on political causes and every avenue that is available to any other organization in the State to solicit contributions from non-members remains available to the union. The court below nonetheless struck the statute down only by treating the workers' minimum constitutional rights as a constitutional ceiling as well as a floor. In the process, the court below rigidly constitutionalized an area of labor law in which the States and the Federal Government have at least since the Lochner era enjoyed substantial discretion to make labor policy. We would request that the Court reverse the decision below, but also reverse and restore room for play in the joints in this area of labor law. I think the starting problem with the court's analysis below is that the rights that are at issue in this area principally are the rights of the individual workers. This court has recognized that agency shop itself raises significant First Amendment issues and First Amendment impingements and so the forced extraction of fees is justified only to the extent that it can be justified by the government's interest in maintaining labor peace or in avoiding free ridership. So as a minimum constitutional matter, the workers have to have an opt-out right.

In both cases the court below failed to take seriously the requirement that capital jurors have a meaningful basis for giving effect to the relevant mitigating qualities of a defendant's evidence, and in both cases the court below found as a factual matter, both against common sense and this Court's holdings, that reasonable jurors would regard evidence that a defendant had experienced significant mistreatment or abuse as a child or had mental impairments as an adult as reasons to find him less dangerous rather than more dangerous. But those opinions, however incorrect, no longer represent the Fifth Circuit's view of Penry. In mid December the Fifth Circuit decided in its en banc decision in Nelson vs. Quarterman to take a sharp turn away from its prior treatment of Penry claims and to follow instead this Court's guidance in Tennard and Smith. Under such circumstances, where the assumption that we imagine underlay this Court's decision to grant review in this case has been so profoundly changed by an intervening decision of the court below, we respectfully suggested by motion that the Court return these cases, vacate the judgments, return them to the Fifth Circuit for further consideration in light of the new opinion in Nelson.</text>",2006

But it is another thing entirely for the Court to decline to exercise jurisdiction that it might well possess. In Ruhrgas clarified, in language that counsel has already quoted, that a court may choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits. Now, the dividing line between a threshold non-merits ground and a merits ground may in some cases be difficult. And the Court has... members of the Court have disagreed in some cases; but there is an easier set of cases and that is where the Court is declining to exercise jurisdiction and especially where as here, it is doing so in favor of litigation of the substantive dispute in another forum. And this Court has... has decided already that it is permissible, for example, for a court to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction before deciding a difficult question of whether it would possess subject matter jurisdiction over the supplemental claims at all. Forum non conveniens is in the nature of an abstention extension doctrine. In Gulf Oil, one of the first cases of this Court to describe the forum non conveniens doctrine and its factors, analogizes forum non conveniens to a Burford abstention. The Court even in Steel Company acknowledged that abstention on grounds of Younger, for example, would be permissible to decide before resolving a disputed question of jurisdiction.</text>",2006

But to be consistent with McConnell's overbreadth decision, any as-applied challenge cannot have the effect of calling into question a substantial percentage of the statute's applications. Yet the district court's decision below has precisely that forbidden effect. There is nothing atypical about the three ads that are before this Court. Indeed, they closely resemble the Jane Doe hypothetical ads that this Court identified at page 127 as the prototype of ads that, although they took the form of issue ads, nonetheless were functionally equivalent to express advocacy.</text>",2006

First of all, I'd like to, I think just with respect correct a premise of one of Justice Scalia's questions. Then I would like to address the two questions that I think I heard the Chief Justice ask, which is how do we know that the this is an atypical ad, and what would the standard... what standard would a court apply in adjudicating as-applied challenges? And then finally, assuming there's time permitting I'd like to address the question of why we shouldn't revisit McConnell which I think was posed both by the Chief Justice and by Justice Scalia. First, as to the premise, Justice Scalia, and it relates to what the predicate was of the now famous vast majority reference. I'm quoting from... it's entirely clear from this Court's opinion and I believe it's on page 207 that the referent was issue ads. In fact, what this Court said was the precise percentage of issue ads that clearly identified a candidate and were aired during those relatively brief pre-election time spans but had no electioneering purpose is a matter of dispute between the parties and among the judges on the district court. Nevertheless, the ""vast majority"" of ads clearly had such a purpose.</text>",2006

10163,2006.06-427-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr.",I'm sorry; you think it might be a reasonable or unreasonable?,"<speaker>Dan Himmelfarb</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The position of the United States is that the court of appeals applied the wrong standard in deciding Brentwood's First Amendment claim. This Court's decisions establish that when the government offers a benefit that a citizen is free to reject, it has much greater leeway in regulating speech than when it exercises its coercive sovereign power. As in cases where the Government acts as an employer, a contractor, a property owner, a service provider or a benefactor, the TSSAA offers a benefit, access to organized athletic competition, that a school may decline by choosing not to become a member of the association. Brentwood's First Amendment challenge to the TSSAA recruiting rule, therefore, is subject to deferential review. Deferential First Amendment review is appropriate in these contexts because the Government occupies a middle ground when it is not exercising its sovereign authority. On the one hand the Government remains the Government no matter what authority it's exercising... so it is subject to the restrictions of the First Amendment. On the other hand, when the Government acts in a non-sovereign capacity, its position is comparable to that of private sector entities and it has to be able to make the same sorts of decisions that they make. It has to be able to decide what conduct is acceptable in its workplace, what activities may take place on its property, and the uses to which its grant money may be put. So the First Amendment can't apply with the same force as when the Government acts in its sovereign capacity. For example, a government agency can tell its employees not to use offensive language with co-workers or customers, as Justice O'Connor pointed out in her plurality opinion in Waters versus Churchill, and that prohibition would not be subject to heightened First Amendment scrutiny. So, too, an athletic association can tell the students at its member schools that they can't use offensive language in dealing with opposing players or referees, as indeed the TSSAA bylaws in fact do. This is at page 202 of the joint appendix. And that prohibition should not be subject to heightened First Amendment scrutiny either. The same is true of other rules that govern membership in and define the character of a voluntary athletic association. As applied to TSSAA's recruiting rule, the deferential standard of review is easily satisfied. Prohibiting the use of undue influence in recruiting or attempting to secure or retain high school athletes we think is self-evidently reasonable in light of the purposes underlying the rule, which include preventing the exploitation of children and ensuring that sports remains subordinate to academics. Prohibiting coaches from contacting students who have not enrolled at the coach's school is likewise reasonable. Either because that prohibition can reasonably be reviewed as an instance of undue influence itself, or because it is a reasonable prophylactic measure to prevent the exertion of undue influence. And finally defining enrollment in the context of the prohibition on coaches contacting students to exclude the situation where a student has somehow announced its intention... announced his intention to attend its school, for example, as in this case by signing an enrollment contract, is reasonable as well for the reasons Ms. Mahoney mentioned in responding to Justice Souter's question.

Roberts, Jr.",It's a close call whether a school can send a brochure to 8th graders that is not limited to athletics telling them about their school?,"<speaker>Dan Himmelfarb</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The position of the United States is that the court of appeals applied the wrong standard in deciding Brentwood's First Amendment claim. This Court's decisions establish that when the government offers a benefit that a citizen is free to reject, it has much greater leeway in regulating speech than when it exercises its coercive sovereign power. As in cases where the Government acts as an employer, a contractor, a property owner, a service provider or a benefactor, the TSSAA offers a benefit, access to organized athletic competition, that a school may decline by choosing not to become a member of the association. Brentwood's First Amendment challenge to the TSSAA recruiting rule, therefore, is subject to deferential review. Deferential First Amendment review is appropriate in these contexts because the Government occupies a middle ground when it is not exercising its sovereign authority. On the one hand the Government remains the Government no matter what authority it's exercising... so it is subject to the restrictions of the First Amendment. On the other hand, when the Government acts in a non-sovereign capacity, its position is comparable to that of private sector entities and it has to be able to make the same sorts of decisions that they make. It has to be able to decide what conduct is acceptable in its workplace, what activities may take place on its property, and the uses to which its grant money may be put. So the First Amendment can't apply with the same force as when the Government acts in its sovereign capacity. For example, a government agency can tell its employees not to use offensive language with co-workers or customers, as Justice O'Connor pointed out in her plurality opinion in Waters versus Churchill, and that prohibition would not be subject to heightened First Amendment scrutiny. So, too, an athletic association can tell the students at its member schools that they can't use offensive language in dealing with opposing players or referees, as indeed the TSSAA bylaws in fact do. This is at page 202 of the joint appendix. And that prohibition should not be subject to heightened First Amendment scrutiny either. The same is true of other rules that govern membership in and define the character of a voluntary athletic association. As applied to TSSAA's recruiting rule, the deferential standard of review is easily satisfied. Prohibiting the use of undue influence in recruiting or attempting to secure or retain high school athletes we think is self-evidently reasonable in light of the purposes underlying the rule, which include preventing the exploitation of children and ensuring that sports remains subordinate to academics. Prohibiting coaches from contacting students who have not enrolled at the coach's school is likewise reasonable. Either because that prohibition can reasonably be reviewed as an instance of undue influence itself, or because it is a reasonable prophylactic measure to prevent the exertion of undue influence. And finally defining enrollment in the context of the prohibition on coaches contacting students to exclude the situation where a student has somehow announced its intention... announced his intention to attend its school, for example, as in this case by signing an enrollment contract, is reasonable as well for the reasons Ms. Mahoney mentioned in responding to Justice Souter's question.

This standard is a profound misreading of Ford versus Wainwright but before I address the merits of that issue, I would like to discuss two preliminary matters first. First, Scott Panetti's petition containing his execution competency claim is not second or successive under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. And second, the State court adjudication of that claim resulted in a decision that was an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law as determined by this Court. The first issue: This is not a second or successive petition.

EPA's principle grounds was that it lacked authority over the emissions of the four substances at issue, even if they, in fact, endanger public health and welfare. That legal conclusion fails as a matter of law. As a fallback position, EPA declined to consider if these substances are endangering public health and welfare, claiming its policy approach made more sense than the regulatory scheme encompassed in section 1202 of the Clean Air Act. Although EPA possesses a good deal of discretion in applying the statutory endangerment test, it cannot rest its ruling on impermissible grounds as it did here.

Milkey</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I may, I'd like to frame the merits very quickly and then turn immediately to standing. Although the case before you arises in an important policy area, it turns on ordinary principles of statutory interpretation and administrative law. EPA made a decision based on two grounds, both of which constitute plain errors of law reviewable under any standard. EPA's principle grounds was that it lacked authority over the emissions of the four substances at issue, even if they, in fact, endanger public health and welfare. That legal conclusion fails as a matter of law. As a fallback position, EPA declined to consider if these substances are endangering public health and welfare, claiming its policy approach made more sense than the regulatory scheme encompassed in section 1202 of the Clean Air Act.

The Ninth Circuit's conclusion that Mr. Brown is entitled to habeas corpus relief should be reversed for three reasons. First, under Section 2254(3)(16) of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act the trial judge's dismissal of Mr. Deal from the jury is a finding of fact of substantial impairment that is presumed correct unless it is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. Mr. Brown has not presented such evidence because the record before the State court supports the decision to remove Mr. Deal, especially since the trial judge had the opportunity to observe Mr. Deal and the defense had no objection to his removal. Second, under 2254(d)(2) the State court decision was based on a reasonable determination of the facts. Since the finding of fact was correct it is necessarily reasonable. And third, under 2254(d)(2), the State court decision was not contrary to Supreme Court precedent. Since the trial court applied the correct standard under Witt and found as fact that Mr. Deal was substantially impaired and this case is immaterially indistinguishable from Witt, the State court's decision was a reasonable application of clearly established Federal law.

The reason that the possibility of psychiatric treatment couldn't be considered is because neither party had put evidence on that question before the jury.","<speaker>Eric S. Multhaup</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Here is Respondent's 60-second nutshell summary of our core position. This case does not turn on the constitutional factor (k) standing alone. Rather, it turns on a straightforward application of the Boyde test, to the unusual, unique circumstances that occurred during the arguments, instructions to deliberations at the penalty trial of this case. Here are the two key components of our claim. During arguments to the jury, both counsel conveyed to the jury that Belmontes' evidence of Youth Authority religious experience was not covered by factor (k). However, both counsel suggested to the jury that it should be considered anyway. Now, this is unusual, because, of all... of all the things that the district attorney and the defense counsel disagreed on, this was one that they did agree on, and it's likely that the jury would have taken note of that. The case then proceeded to instructions and deliberations. The jury came back to court, announced that they were deeply divided, perhaps with a majority favoring life. The turning point occurred when one juror, Juror Hern, requested judicial confirmation that the specific list of factors previously given was the only base... was the only framework within which the penalty decision could be made.

Is it simply sufficient that it is labeled aiding and abetting?,"<speaker>Dan Himmelfarb</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. The Ninth Circuit held that the term theft offense, an aggravated felony under the Immigration and Nationality Act, does not include aiding and abetting. That holding is incorrect. Indeed, it is so clearly incorrect that even respondent does not defend it. Respondent's aiding and abetting argument is that his violation of the California vehicle theft statute is not a theft offense under the INA, not because the California statute covers aiding and abetting and the theft offense does not, as the Ninth Circuit held, but because the California statute covers a certain kind of aiding and abetting, so-called natural and probable consequences rule, and a theft offense does not. That theory is slightly narrower than the Ninth Circuit's but it is mistaken for many of the same reasons. One of the reasons that the Ninth Circuit's holding is mistaken is that it would drastically limit the number of aliens who could be treated as aggravated felons based on a conviction obtained in any jurisdiction, because no jurisdiction distinguishes between principals and aiders and abetters and it is ordinarily not possible to prove that an alien in a particular case was not convicted as an aider and abettor.

And if the district court's opinion does not reflect reckless disregard for the law, for the reading of the statute, then it would be inappropriate to characterize Petitioners' adoption of the very same views as either a knowing or reckless violation of the, of the FCRA. The first... the Ninth Circuit nevertheless reached a contrary conclusion, and said it was time to go ahead and look at privileged communications if the Petitioners wanted to defend the case, because they made self-interpretive errors about the meaning of willfully. And the first is that they read willfully in this setting to mean recklessly, and relied on several cases where this Court has read the term willfully in civil statutes to mean recklessly. But this Court has said repeatedly that the word willfully is contextual, that you have to look at all of the sections of the statute to see how it's used to determine whether it means with knowledge that your conduct violates the law, or whether reckless violations are sufficient. And in this particular statute, unlike the other three that were at issue, Congress has used the term willfully in other sections of the law to mean, as Plaintiffs concede, that the Defendant knows that their conduct violates the Act.</text>",2006

The amendment said nothing about its application to pending appeals, and someone had to decide whether and how it applied to this case.

Clement</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court-- This case presents the same basic constitutional question concerning the Federal Partial Birth Abortion Act as the first case. Of course, the Ninth Circuit in the decision under review here went much further in invalidating the Federal act. If I could begin by talking about whether what we're talking about here is medical necessity or just some marginal effect on the risks. I think in order to fairly understand the argument that respondents are making in this case, their argument has to be a matter of simply marginal risks, because one illustration of this, as I indicated in the first argument, if a doctor really believes that a D&X procedure is the way to go in a case then there's no ban on the procedure as such. What the act bans is the infliction of the D&X procedure on a living fetus. So if a doctor really thinks the D&X procedure is the way to go, he can induce fetal demise at the outset of the procedure.</text>",2006

Despite Casey, Stenberg suggested that there is a narrow category of previability abortions, intact D&Es, as this Court understood that term in Stenberg, that can be banned so long as the ban contains a health exception. But I'd like to leave the health exception question aside for a minute and turn to the scope of the law that Congress has enacted here. The question is whether Congress can enact a previability abortion ban that does not track the hallmark of intact D&E abortions as this Court understood that term in Stenberg and by doing so to ban a substantially greater array of abortions than would be banned had the law faithfully tracked the language in the Stenberg opinions about what constitutes an intact D&E. And I'm referring both to the majority opinion in Stenberg and in the dissents. It is our position that this Court must reject Congress's effort to exploit the limited license that this Court seemingly granted in Stenberg because to allow such an expansion of previability abortions that can be banned would set the stage for continued legislative efforts to ban other iterations of the classic D&E method of abortion until truly there would be nothing left at all of Casey's holding that it is unconstitutional to ban previability second trimester abortions. The government in this case has conceded that the act bans more abortions than merely the intact D&E as this Court understood it in Stenberg. But I want to highlight for the Court how the language of this act departs from the hallmarks of intact D&E and how these departures place doctors at risk of prosecution for the very facet of D&E abortions, and by that I mean all D&E abortions, that enhance their safety. There is three respects in which the act departs from the hallmarks of intact D&E as understood in Stenberg. First, the act does not require breach extraction of an intact fetus to the head, one of the primary hallmarks that this Court understood in Stenberg. Instead, the act applies once the fetus is extracted past the navel, a far more frequent occurrence than extraction to the head. And in fact the government in its briefing both in their initial brief and in their reply concede that in any of what the government calls standard D&Es a living fetus can be extracted past the fetal navel before demise occurs. In addition, the act does not require the fetus to be delivered intact at the end of the procedure, another component of what is considered to be a hallmark of intact D&E in Stenberg.

Section 271(f) is a limited extension of normal territoriality principles that is designed to shore up the prohibition against actually making a patented invention in the United States, but it does not take the further and extraordinary step of applying United States law to the conduct of copying parts abroad for assembly and sale abroad conduct is properly the subject of foreign law. As a result, in the context of traditional manufacturing, for example, it has always been understood pursuant to the statute's text, that while companies cannot make parts in the United States for final assembly abroad... that's too close to making it here... they may make copies in a foreign country by, for example, sending the design to the foreign country or sending a specific part to the foreign country that can be copied there. That distinction between copying in the United States and copying in the foreign country has two critical dimensions. The first is that it protects the foreign government's sovereign prerogative to establish the rules of competition that will govern companies that wish to compete in that foreign country's markets by copying their products abroad, assembling them there and selling them there. The second, which is the flip side of that point, is that it enables United States companies to compete on an even playing field abroad against their foreign competitors by manufacturing, assembling, and selling parts abroad, subject--</text>",2006

Now, with respect to this question of whether we pursued or didn't pursue waiver, I'm afraid counsel for the State is just wrong about this. It's important to understand how this comes up. We asserted a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, deficient performance and prejudice. The State asserted as a defense to that claim: No, no, he's waived. And the trial judge, the State habeas judge in the State court conviction ruling, agreed with that and said, well, yes, he's waived. We then filed a petition for rehearing in which we said, no, you can't rely on that defense because it's got to be a knowing and intelligent waiver under Johnson against Zerbst. That's at page 92 of the joint appendix. That motion for rehearing was denied without any further comment. We then took a petition to review to the Arizona Supreme Court. That's also in the joint appendix and I believe the page cite is 101 and 102, in which we specifically argued that you can't look to this so-called waiver as a defense to our claim of ineffective assistance because it wasn't knowingly and intent. Now, in the State's response to our petition, which unfortunately is not in the joint appendix but is in the record, the State says: No, this waiver is binding and, furthermore, you're procedurally defaulted because this procedure was decided on direct review.
