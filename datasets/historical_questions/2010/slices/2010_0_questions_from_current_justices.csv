Because, today, a sentencing judge can engage in the same analysis that the Sentencing Commission may engage in when it decides that a guideline range should be lowered and that that should be retroactive. The judge can do that at the time when the sentence is imposed. We roll the clock back on the crack -- on the crack cocaine guidelines. Under the authority that judges now have under Booker and Fanfan, a judge could say, well, I see that this is the crack cocaine guideline right now, but I think it is too harsh for all the reasons that were later persuasive in lowering the range, and therefore, I am sentencing below the range. So it seems to lead logically to the conclusion that 3582 is yet another provision of the Sentencing Reform Act that was tied to the old pre-Booker mandatory sentencing regime, and now that that is out the window with Booker and Fanfan, the whole -- the whole mechanism is -- is superfluous.","<speaker>Curtis E.

It is the judge's decision as to what the sentence should be which he denotes in accepting the agreement that binds. And I think -- I may be making Justice Breyer's argument -- that if under the policy statement and it's clear what the judge did here, if the judge feels bound by the agreement or otherwise to calculate a sentence in the guidelines and impose one in the guidelines, how can you say that the legal effect is not the guideline sentence?","<speaker>Curtis E.

If Congress wanted to impose a clear and convincing burden, why in the world would they not have said that expressly in that sentence?

And, third, the phrase ""shall be presumed valid"" doesn't seem to me at all to suggest clear and convincing evidence.

If Congress intended to make the first sale doctrine discriminate in favor of foreign manufacturing at the same time, one would expect some note to be taken of that fact in the legislative history, but none is.

Englert, Jr.</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is a repeat of Quality King v. L'anza with only one pertinent difference. Both cases involve goods not authorized for importation into the United States. Both cases involve arguments that the first sale doctrine must be narrowly construed, thus the Copyright Act's importation ban, section 602(a), be given less than its supposedly intended scope. The only difference is place of manufacture of the goods. Quality King involved U.S. manufactured goods; this case involves goods made in Switzerland. According to the Ninth Circuit in Omega, Congress intended to treat foreign manufactured goods better in this respect than goods made in the United States. It is wildly implausible that Congress had any such intent. From 1790 to 1891, foreigners were categorically ineligible to hold U.S. copyrights. From 1891 to 1986, the United States discriminated against foreign manufacturing of copyrighted goods through a series of so-called manufacturing clauses, including section 601 of the 1976 Act. If Congress intended to make the first sale doctrine discriminate in favor of foreign manufacturing at the same time, one would expect some note to be taken of that fact in the legislative history, but none is. And yet the Ninth Circuit held that Congress in 1976 altered the long-established first sale doctrine to make it uniquely favorable to foreign manufacturing of copyrighted goods and did so through the obscure phrase, 109. No one in all the briefs in this case has identified a single reason why Congress would have wanted to do so. Moreover, the words 109. Most instructive is the very next section after section 109, section 110, which governs educational use of copyrighted works and was enacted contemporaneously with 109. In describing the kinds of works teachers may show students in their classroom without fear of copyright liability, Congress referred to works lawfully made under this title. Our briefs have pointed out the absurdity of construing the phrase in section 110 to mean made in the United States, and it's very revealing how Respondent and its amici have tried to answer that point.

Until 1998, subsection (B), which we've been talking about, was the only class D felony that involved vehicular flight in Indiana law. In 1998 the Indiana General Assembly broke out and enacted subsection (A) so that in cases of vehicular flight prosecutors would not have to prove risk; they would just have to prove that defendant used a vehicle. Since 1998, I have found 14 cases in the Indiana Court of Appeals, one of which is the Hape case that Justice Alito cited earlier. All of them, so far as I can tell, proceeded under (A) and not under (B). Of those 14 cases, 13 have enough facts to tell what the flight was -- of what kind. 10 involved speeding, disregarding traffic laws, or striking an officer with a vehicle.

Burke</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 2005 when Congress passed the Bankruptcy Act, it made a policy decision to limit judicial discretion on a case-by-case basis in the area of reasonable and necessary expenses. It did so by creating a formula that entails an aggregate set amount of expenses for an individual. Now, Congress could have created this from scratch. It could have used an arbitrary figure. But instead, there are figures that the IRS already had, based on Census Bureau statistics, that said nationwide, in a certain area, an individual would spend this much a month on average. In the case of Mr. Ransom, that's approximately 2500 a month. Forgetting about how it's divided up, if I had 100 people come in and answer the following five questions the same way Mr. Ransom did, and that's age, location, household size, gross income, and if you have a vehicle, how many, they would all get $2,500 standard aggregate deduction, which works out to $150,000 over a five-year period.

The third point: Because of FOIA's purpose, if you find that the language, the plain language, is not clear or if you find that the legislative history isn't sufficient, then the focus must be on an interpretation that supports disclosure, not secrecy. And finally, Congress in enacting FOIA conducted the balancing. It reserved for it, itself, the authority to add to or expand FOIA through Exemption 3. It did not leave agency discretion available for the agencies to decide what documents they can provide or not. Moving into our first argument, the plain language. At issue is a very short sentence related solely to internal personnel rules and procedures -- and rules and practices. Congress chose to use the words ""related solely"" on purpose. That's an extremely narrow view. Now, we understand if you look at the words in isolation, perhaps you could see that there is some conflict between them.

I think it's important to put the particular regulatory provisions here in a larger context because the policy question at issue here, whether there should be advance notice under these circumstances, is not new. It did not arise with this litigation. It has been the subject of intense regulatory focus at the Board since 2004. It has been the subject of two rounds of notice and comment rulemaking, of consumer testing, and finally of an amendment to the rule to provide notice under these circumstances, notice that in the court of appeals view had always been required, unbeknownst to the Board or anyone in the regulatory community.</text>",2010

Waxman</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question presented is how to interpret a since-amended version of Regulation Z. In amicus briefs filed, solicited by the First Circuit and by this Court, the Federal Reserve Board has confirmed that it has long interpreted its regulation just as Chase Bank and the rest of the regulated credit card industry understood.</text>",2010
