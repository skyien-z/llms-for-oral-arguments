And it sells this product to many, many, many hundreds of thousands of people. And most of them use this product with no adverse effect whatsoever, but there are ten cases where somebody uses this product and they go blind. Three of those ten cases, the person had to borrow a contact lens from a friend, only used it in one eye, they go blind only in that one eye. This is not statistically significant.

That's the question presented. Justice Kagan started with the point that the FDA doesn't require that. It requires just reasonable evidence of a connection, not statistical. Many of the amici here have done a wonderful job of explaining why statistical importance can't be a measure because it depends on the nature of the study at issue. So given all of that -- and even in your brief, in a footnote, you answered the question by saying, no, we can't establish that rule as an absolute, because there are additional factors that could prove materiality and scienter. So you've already answered the question presented. Are we down to what Justice Scalia asked you, which is: We got a no to the question: Are the facts in this case enough?

Just to start in with some of the Court's questions: First, Justice Scalia's: Does the court require proof of loss causation? The Fifth Circuit could not be more clear. It is not talking about rebutting the presumption of reliance, giving the defendants an opportunity to do that at class certification.

And that is a very heavy burden, as the district court in this case realized.

24987,2010.10-76-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Horwich, could I ask you a different kind of question, and I apologize in advanced for taking you a little bit far afield? But -- but I wanted to ask you about a particular sentence in your brief that seems to have some relevance to, not the general jurisdiction question but some relevance to specific jurisdiction. So this is on page 20. You say: ""If mere purposeful availment of commercial opportunities in a particular State, which is of course the test for a specific jurisdiction, if that purposeful availment were sufficient to subject an enterprise to the general jurisdiction of that State's courts, a corporation that sold its goods to an independent distributor intending that they be resold in all 50 States could potentially be brought to judgment in any State on any claim against it. "" So I -- I take that -- I understand that to read that you think that it is purposeful availment that subjects a company to specific jurisdiction -- not to general jurisdiction, but to specific jurisdiction -- if a corporation sold its goods to an independent distributor intending that they be resold in all 50 States. Am I reading that correctly?","<speaker>Benjamin J. Horwich</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The North Carolina State court was wrong to assert general personal jurisdiction over Petitioners, extending potentially to any claim against them arising out of any conduct of theirs anywhere in the world, and there are several ways to see why that's wrong. Even if the Court were to accept the proposition that such contacts with North Carolina as there are in the record should be attributed to Petitioners, those contacts still don't rise to the level of what this Court has -- has demanded in terms of continuous and systematic contacts. And even setting those more -- those more precedential tests aside, I think there's also a -- the result of the North Carolina court's decision is that the jurisdictional consequences here would be quite disproportionate to the contacts that -- that -- on which it would be based. So if I can, I guess, turn for a moment to the continuous and systematic contacts proposition, which this Court has certainly not elaborated in its case law, but I think it -- it would be -- I think it's useful to speak of, of what exactly the Court was trying to get at. What we think the Court was trying to get at, particularly by, as my friend referred to, particularly by its reference in Helicopteros to Perkins as -- as being sort of a benchmark for what continuous and systematic contacts are, I think it requires seeing an active volitional undertaking by the -- by the defendant. It can't be based on the contact -- conduct of third parties. Obviously the continuous concept of existing without interruption. And with respect to systematic, we think that that means there needs to be a plurality of contacts, they have to be of -- of different kinds or qualities in a sense of perhaps employment, as well as contractual, as well as regulatory, as well as property, as well as sales or purchases, and that those contacts together have to have some interrelationship that results in something that might be thought of as more than the sum of their parts.</text>",2010

There are three reasons why the Petitioner should not be personally liable for money damages. The first is because the prosecutor's act of seeking the material witness warrant is integrally associated with the judicial process and entitled to absolute immunity. To view it any other way is to expose both line prosecutors and high officials to lawsuits by highly incentivized litigants based on their purportedly bad motives.

Allowing such suits to proceed would result in burdensome litigation and interfere with the ability of prosecutors to do their jobs.

How is this case different from a situation where the agency looks at a request for a minimum standard, says: Require that a certain light be added to the lights in a car. The agency comes back and says, you know, there are so many designs of cars; in some cars, particularly sedans, the light is an added safety feature; in vans it may not be because of the size of vans. And so we are not going to require it. We are going to let manufacturers, depending on what design their car has, to choose between the two, so that we're not going to set a minimum standard for every one because there are too many different designs. Despite that ruling, the manufacturer says it costs two pennies more to put this light in a sedan. I know the agency has said it's safer, but I don't want to do it. I don't have a van, I don't have any reason except the two pennies that I don't want to do it. Is that case preempted? Because you were just merely given the option?","<speaker>Martin N.

The district court exempted this case from the ordinary pattern requirement by making a flawed analogy to a hypothetical in this Court's City of Canton opinion. There, the Court suggested that a city may be liable, absent a pattern, if it fails to inform police officers of the basic constitutional standard for deadly force.

The States ask that the courts assess liability and design a new common law remedy for contributing to climate change, and to do so by applying a general standard of reasonableness to determine for each defendant, in this case and in future cases, what, if any, its share of global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions ought to be. That would require the courts not to interpret and enforce the policy choices placed into law by the other branches, but to make those policy choices themselves. And all of our arguments here -- that plaintiffs lack standing, that the Federal common law shouldn't be expanded to include this new cause of action, and that the case presents nonjusticiable political questions -- while all of them represent distinct points, All of them flow from the same basic separation of powers principles that establish, we believe, that the case ought to be dismissed.</text>",2010
