Because all that would happen in a criminal suit is that the defendant's conviction would be undone, but that doesn't mean that the State is bound in some way. The State wasn't a party to the criminal action.","<speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The standing of Petitioner to challenge the constitutionality of the Federal statute under which her liberty is being deprived should not be open to serious question. She clearly satisfies this Court's modern tripartite test for standing. Indeed, it is hard to imagine an injury more particularized or concrete than six years in Federal prison, and the liberty interest she seeks to vindicate is her own, not some third party's. In many ways, I think ""standing"" is a bit of a misnomer here. Petitioner is not a plaintiff who seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of a Federal court. She is a defendant who has been hailed into court by a Federal prosecutor. There is no logical reason she should not be able to mount a constitutional attack on the statute that is the basis for the prosecution.</text>",2010
