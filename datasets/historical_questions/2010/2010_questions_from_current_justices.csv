Because, today, a sentencing judge can engage in the same analysis that the Sentencing Commission may engage in when it decides that a guideline range should be lowered and that that should be retroactive. The judge can do that at the time when the sentence is imposed. We roll the clock back on the crack -- on the crack cocaine guidelines. Under the authority that judges now have under Booker and Fanfan, a judge could say, well, I see that this is the crack cocaine guideline right now, but I think it is too harsh for all the reasons that were later persuasive in lowering the range, and therefore, I am sentencing below the range. So it seems to lead logically to the conclusion that 3582 is yet another provision of the Sentencing Reform Act that was tied to the old pre-Booker mandatory sentencing regime, and now that that is out the window with Booker and Fanfan, the whole -- the whole mechanism is -- is superfluous.","<speaker>Curtis E.

It is the judge's decision as to what the sentence should be which he denotes in accepting the agreement that binds. And I think -- I may be making Justice Breyer's argument -- that if under the policy statement and it's clear what the judge did here, if the judge feels bound by the agreement or otherwise to calculate a sentence in the guidelines and impose one in the guidelines, how can you say that the legal effect is not the guideline sentence?","<speaker>Curtis E.

If Congress wanted to impose a clear and convincing burden, why in the world would they not have said that expressly in that sentence?

And, third, the phrase ""shall be presumed valid"" doesn't seem to me at all to suggest clear and convincing evidence.

If Congress intended to make the first sale doctrine discriminate in favor of foreign manufacturing at the same time, one would expect some note to be taken of that fact in the legislative history, but none is.

Englert, Jr.</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is a repeat of Quality King v. L'anza with only one pertinent difference. Both cases involve goods not authorized for importation into the United States. Both cases involve arguments that the first sale doctrine must be narrowly construed, thus the Copyright Act's importation ban, section 602(a), be given less than its supposedly intended scope. The only difference is place of manufacture of the goods. Quality King involved U.S. manufactured goods; this case involves goods made in Switzerland. According to the Ninth Circuit in Omega, Congress intended to treat foreign manufactured goods better in this respect than goods made in the United States. It is wildly implausible that Congress had any such intent. From 1790 to 1891, foreigners were categorically ineligible to hold U.S. copyrights. From 1891 to 1986, the United States discriminated against foreign manufacturing of copyrighted goods through a series of so-called manufacturing clauses, including section 601 of the 1976 Act. If Congress intended to make the first sale doctrine discriminate in favor of foreign manufacturing at the same time, one would expect some note to be taken of that fact in the legislative history, but none is. And yet the Ninth Circuit held that Congress in 1976 altered the long-established first sale doctrine to make it uniquely favorable to foreign manufacturing of copyrighted goods and did so through the obscure phrase, 109. No one in all the briefs in this case has identified a single reason why Congress would have wanted to do so. Moreover, the words 109. Most instructive is the very next section after section 109, section 110, which governs educational use of copyrighted works and was enacted contemporaneously with 109. In describing the kinds of works teachers may show students in their classroom without fear of copyright liability, Congress referred to works lawfully made under this title. Our briefs have pointed out the absurdity of construing the phrase in section 110 to mean made in the United States, and it's very revealing how Respondent and its amici have tried to answer that point.

Until 1998, subsection (B), which we've been talking about, was the only class D felony that involved vehicular flight in Indiana law. In 1998 the Indiana General Assembly broke out and enacted subsection (A) so that in cases of vehicular flight prosecutors would not have to prove risk; they would just have to prove that defendant used a vehicle. Since 1998, I have found 14 cases in the Indiana Court of Appeals, one of which is the Hape case that Justice Alito cited earlier. All of them, so far as I can tell, proceeded under (A) and not under (B). Of those 14 cases, 13 have enough facts to tell what the flight was -- of what kind. 10 involved speeding, disregarding traffic laws, or striking an officer with a vehicle.

Burke</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 2005 when Congress passed the Bankruptcy Act, it made a policy decision to limit judicial discretion on a case-by-case basis in the area of reasonable and necessary expenses. It did so by creating a formula that entails an aggregate set amount of expenses for an individual. Now, Congress could have created this from scratch. It could have used an arbitrary figure. But instead, there are figures that the IRS already had, based on Census Bureau statistics, that said nationwide, in a certain area, an individual would spend this much a month on average. In the case of Mr. Ransom, that's approximately 2500 a month. Forgetting about how it's divided up, if I had 100 people come in and answer the following five questions the same way Mr. Ransom did, and that's age, location, household size, gross income, and if you have a vehicle, how many, they would all get $2,500 standard aggregate deduction, which works out to $150,000 over a five-year period.

The third point: Because of FOIA's purpose, if you find that the language, the plain language, is not clear or if you find that the legislative history isn't sufficient, then the focus must be on an interpretation that supports disclosure, not secrecy. And finally, Congress in enacting FOIA conducted the balancing. It reserved for it, itself, the authority to add to or expand FOIA through Exemption 3. It did not leave agency discretion available for the agencies to decide what documents they can provide or not. Moving into our first argument, the plain language. At issue is a very short sentence related solely to internal personnel rules and procedures -- and rules and practices. Congress chose to use the words ""related solely"" on purpose. That's an extremely narrow view. Now, we understand if you look at the words in isolation, perhaps you could see that there is some conflict between them.

I think it's important to put the particular regulatory provisions here in a larger context because the policy question at issue here, whether there should be advance notice under these circumstances, is not new. It did not arise with this litigation. It has been the subject of intense regulatory focus at the Board since 2004. It has been the subject of two rounds of notice and comment rulemaking, of consumer testing, and finally of an amendment to the rule to provide notice under these circumstances, notice that in the court of appeals view had always been required, unbeknownst to the Board or anyone in the regulatory community.</text>",2010

And although there is in many contexts reluctance to put an individual to that choice, there is not an inflexible rule against it. And to take one example, a criminal defendant has an absolute constitutional right to testify in his own defense. He also has an absolute constitutional right to resist compelled testimony in which the prosecution will ask him hostile questions, but he doesn't have a constitutional right to do both. If he chooses -- chooses to take the stand and testify, he may be cross-examined at trial by the prosecution, and he has no residual Fifth Amendment right to resist the hostile--</text>",2010

What you haven't said to me is what entitles you, outside of equity, and what stops either a State court or a Federal -- a State legislature or a congressional legislature, from saying when someone is in bankruptcy this is the res and these are the people who are entitled to it.

Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act provides that an arbitration agreement may be held unenforceable under State law only if the State law rule being invoked to invalidate the agreement qualifies as a ground that exists in law or equity for the revocation of any contract. Respondent argues that, because California's Discover Bank rule does not facially discriminate against arbitration, it falls within the savings clause. But the plain language of the savings clause makes clear that it is not limited to statutes that discriminates facially against arbitration. By referring to ""any contract"", it makes clear that, as this Court has said, the rule must be applicable to contracts generally.</text>",2010

They are identifying a class of cases in which they pursue the State, who's their own sovereign, and the savings clause in the FAA permits them in law or equity to set forth rules to say in this subset of cases there is a substantive right being affected. That is different than rules that are looking at procedures and setting uniform procedures in both. How do we draw the line between a law that says discovery has to happen in arbitration, and one that says a -- in a contract of adhesion, if the superior party retains the right to do discovery but tells the inferior party, you can't?

24987,2010.10-76-t01,respondent,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Horwich, could I ask you a different kind of question, and I apologize in advanced for taking you a little bit far afield? But -- but I wanted to ask you about a particular sentence in your brief that seems to have some relevance to, not the general jurisdiction question but some relevance to specific jurisdiction. So this is on page 20. You say: ""If mere purposeful availment of commercial opportunities in a particular State, which is of course the test for a specific jurisdiction, if that purposeful availment were sufficient to subject an enterprise to the general jurisdiction of that State's courts, a corporation that sold its goods to an independent distributor intending that they be resold in all 50 States could potentially be brought to judgment in any State on any claim against it. "" So I -- I take that -- I understand that to read that you think that it is purposeful availment that subjects a company to specific jurisdiction -- not to general jurisdiction, but to specific jurisdiction -- if a corporation sold its goods to an independent distributor intending that they be resold in all 50 States. Am I reading that correctly?","<speaker>Benjamin J. Horwich</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The North Carolina State court was wrong to assert general personal jurisdiction over Petitioners, extending potentially to any claim against them arising out of any conduct of theirs anywhere in the world, and there are several ways to see why that's wrong. Even if the Court were to accept the proposition that such contacts with North Carolina as there are in the record should be attributed to Petitioners, those contacts still don't rise to the level of what this Court has -- has demanded in terms of continuous and systematic contacts. And even setting those more -- those more precedential tests aside, I think there's also a -- the result of the North Carolina court's decision is that the jurisdictional consequences here would be quite disproportionate to the contacts that -- that -- on which it would be based. So if I can, I guess, turn for a moment to the continuous and systematic contacts proposition, which this Court has certainly not elaborated in its case law, but I think it -- it would be -- I think it's useful to speak of, of what exactly the Court was trying to get at. What we think the Court was trying to get at, particularly by, as my friend referred to, particularly by its reference in Helicopteros to Perkins as -- as being sort of a benchmark for what continuous and systematic contacts are, I think it requires seeing an active volitional undertaking by the -- by the defendant. It can't be based on the contact -- conduct of third parties. Obviously the continuous concept of existing without interruption. And with respect to systematic, we think that that means there needs to be a plurality of contacts, they have to be of -- of different kinds or qualities in a sense of perhaps employment, as well as contractual, as well as regulatory, as well as property, as well as sales or purchases, and that those contacts together have to have some interrelationship that results in something that might be thought of as more than the sum of their parts.</text>",2010

There are three reasons why the Petitioner should not be personally liable for money damages.

Frederick</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is a case that presents a non-existent problem and a solution that is in search of a non-existent problem, because there are no real reported cases where there have been problems arising under the Rogers instructions that have become the model instructions under the Federal Rules for over 50 years. And if could I just begin, Justice Kennedy, with your question which opened this up, proximate cause serves two principal functions. One is to limit the scope of the persons to whom the tortfeasor owes a duty; and the second is to limit the kinds of injuries that that person would be liable for. The innovation in FELA that is so important to understand about why the relaxed causation standard became the accepted standard under FELA was that FELA, by its plain terms, did away with the first concept of proximate cause because it limited the duty to the employee by the employer. There is no one outside of that relationship that can bring an action under FELA.

How is this case different from a situation where the agency looks at a request for a minimum standard, says: Require that a certain light be added to the lights in a car. The agency comes back and says, you know, there are so many designs of cars; in some cars, particularly sedans, the light is an added safety feature; in vans it may not be because of the size of vans. And so we are not going to require it. We are going to let manufacturers, depending on what design their car has, to choose between the two, so that we're not going to set a minimum standard for every one because there are too many different designs. Despite that ruling, the manufacturer says it costs two pennies more to put this light in a sedan. I know the agency has said it's safer, but I don't want to do it.

The district court exempted this case from the ordinary pattern requirement by making a flawed analogy to a hypothetical in this Court's City of Canton opinion. There, the Court suggested that a city may be liable, absent a pattern, if it fails to inform police officers of the basic constitutional standard for deadly force.

The basic principles do kind of merge together, and why does it make -- again, why does it make that much of a difference and why do you put the burden on the defendant to parse the claim one way or another, since I assume they can make pretty much all the same arguments under an enumerated powers -- under the enumerated powers clause--","<speaker>Paul D. Clement</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The standing of Petitioner to challenge the constitutionality of the Federal statute under which her liberty is being deprived should not be open to serious question. She clearly satisfies this Court's modern tripartite test for standing. Indeed, it is hard to imagine an injury more particularized or concrete than six years in Federal prison, and the liberty interest she seeks to vindicate is her own, not some third party's. In many ways, I think ""standing"" is a bit of a misnomer here. Petitioner is not a plaintiff who seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of a Federal court. She is a defendant who has been hailed into court by a Federal prosecutor. There is no logical reason she should not be able to mount a constitutional attack on the statute that is the basis for the prosecution.</text>",2010

Are you saying that -- that she is arguing that Congress does not have the power to enact legislation that's necessary and proper for the implementation of treaties, but only for the making of treaties; that she's making that argument that's been made by some academic writers?","<speaker>Paul D.

Because all that would happen in a criminal suit is that the defendant's conviction would be undone, but that doesn't mean that the State is bound in some way. The State wasn't a party to the criminal action.","<speaker>Paul D.
