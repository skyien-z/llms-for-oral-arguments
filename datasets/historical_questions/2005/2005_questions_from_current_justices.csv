It's, in effect, the same thing, isn't it?","<speaker>Michael R. Dreeben</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- The law of consent searches is governed by a determination of what is reasonable for the police to do in a particular circumstance, and it starts from the premise that consent is not a disfavored species in the law, that cooperation with law enforcement is a good thing and should be encouraged. The right of the cotenant, in this case, to consent stems from her common authority, which is independent of his and allows her to serve valuable social interests, as well as interests that represents her own personal interest. Many of these cases arise not among couples who are harmonious, but among couples in which there is some degree of tension, and the spouse who consents in these situations has an independent interest in ensuring that she can call upon the protection of the law.</text>",2005

580,2005.04-980-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Counsel, I was confused by your answer to Justice O'Connor's question. Do you think the... we should review the California Supreme Court's harmless error analysis, or should we undertake a Brecht analysis?","<speaker>Jane N. Kirkland</speaker><text>Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- Whether a capital sentencing statute is categorized as ""weighing"" or ""nonweighing"" determines how courts assess the impact of an invalid death eligibility factor on a jury's sentence selection. To decide whether a statute is ""weighing"" or ""nonweighing"", we look to the function, if any, of an eligibility factor in the statute's sentence selection process. In a ""weighing"" scheme, as this Court first stated in Zant, a jury is specifically instructed to weigh the statutory eligibility factors, along with any mitigation, to choose the sentence. In a ""nonweighing"" scheme, the eligibility factors have no role above the role of ""all other sentencing evidence"". California is a ""nonweighing"" State, for two primary reasons. First, the only reference whatsoever to 11 open ended sentencing factors is in its sentencing factor (a), but that reference has no significance, because, under the language of the statute and the holdings of the California Supreme Court, factor (a) means the jury is to consider, if it's relevant, the facts and circumstances of the offenses, including the facts and circumstances that underlie the eligibility factors.</text>",2005
581,2005.04-980-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","--decision, where, as I read it, it says juries don't give special circumstances any extra weight in considering all the variety of factors listed in the statute?","<speaker>Nina Rivkind</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- I would like to focus on the observation that we need to look at what the jury was instructed, because I think that will clarify for the Court that California's 1978 law is, indeed, a ""weighing"" statute under the established law of this Court. In Mr. Sanders' case, the jury was instructed in the language of section 190.3, and this language gave the jury a very explicit roadmap as to how it was to undertake its sentence selection in this case. Section 190.3 assigns a specific role to the aggravating factors. It tells a jury that, ""In determining the penalty, you shall consider, take into account, and be guided by the listed enumerated factors. "" The special circumstances, as the questions from the Court have noted, are specifically included. Factor (a) has two independent components, and one is the existence of any ""special circumstance"" finding. As Justice Stevens noted, this could only be considered aggravating. It is, after all, the reason that California has said that this case moved from being an ordinary murder to being one that was worthy of either death or life without parole.</text>",2005

Phillips</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- This case involves the somewhat murky concept of an association in fact enterprise within the meaning of section 1961(4) of title 18, which is the RICO statute, and actually the specific language in this case, which is reproduced in the petitioner's brief at page 2, is a group of individuals associated in fact. In this case, there are two fairly obvious enterprises that one might have expected plaintiff to identify in this... in its... in their complaint. The first one is Mohawk Industries, which is their employer. That is a corporation, clearly eligible to serve as an enterprise. But, of course, the problem is if you identify Mohawk as the... as the enterprise, you then cannot sue Mohawk as the person under this Court's decision in Kushner. And so Mohawk was an unattractive enterprise under... on that... because of that reason. Second, there are the recruiting and temporary agencies which are likely corporations and certainly are legal entities and, again, are eligible to be enterprises within the meaning of the statute. But, again, here the problem is that there is no indication that Mohawk in any way directs or conducts the affairs of those agencies, and therefore, under this Court's explicit holding in Reves, there would no... there would be no basis for liability. And so the plaintiffs have attempted to sort of move around those two substantial obstacles to stating a claim by laying the claim to what is called an association in fact enterprise. Their complaint at paragraph 76, which is on page 23 of the joint appendix, states this fairly broadly. Mohawk has participated in an association in fact enterprise with third party employment agencies and other recruiters. The question is what is this enterprise and does it have legs for purposes of bringing a RICO action. In analyzing that question, it seems to me there are two subissues within that. The first one is whether or not the language of section 1961(4) precludes using the corporation as part of an association in fact enterprise because 1961(4) explicitly... or specifically refers to individuals, and everyone has recognized, including I think the respondents and the United States, that if... if it were clear that association in fact enterprises or that enterprises limited to individuals under these circumstances, given the structure of the statute, the corporation would not be permissibly brought in on this particular theory.

MAMSI has consistently taken the position that its money claim is governed exclusively by the terms of its contract with the Sereboffs. This contract expressly disclaims and replaces most equitable principles. At its core, MAMSI's claim is nothing more than a request for money damages. This claim is not cognizable under ERISA because MAMSI is not entitled to any relief that was typically available at equity.</text>",2005

Mahoney</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The complaint in this case actually alleges that Domino's breached its obligations under a contract with JWM. It does not allege that any of the terms of McDonald's own contracts were violated. The Ninth Circuit, nevertheless, held that Mr. McDonald could recover damages so long as he could show that he had suffered some distinct injury arising out of the violation of the contracts between his company and Domino's. We... we ask this Court to reverse that holding for two principal reasons. First, Mr. McDonald did not hold any rights under the contracts between his company JWM and Domino's, and that's disqualifying under section 1981. Second, the injuries that he alleges are simply too indirect to be cognizable under an implied right of action. This Court, even in the context of express rights of action, whether RICO or the Clayton Act, has looked to the background principles of the common law to define the scope of a damage recovery. And these kinds of injuries, which are really the classic form of derivative injury, have never been recoverable.</text>",2005

Do you agree with your friend that money that's spent, that's going to have to be spent anyway in the State Court proceeding, though, is not wasted, that that's not recoverable?","<speaker>Jan T. Chilton</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- Since the first Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress has given defendants the right to remove cases to Federal Court. Respondents did so properly in this case, and there's no dispute about that. The... both lower courts found that we had reasonable grounds for removal, on two bases... based on the only Circuit Court decisions then extant on aggregating punitive damages and attorneys fees. Petitioners conceded that fact here this morning and also in the trial court, District Court, before they moved to remand, a year after removal and after the District Court in the same hearing had indicated its tentative decision to rule against them on the merits of a dismissal motion. So, the issue before the Court today is whether 1447(c) requires a District Court to impose a substantial penalty in the form of attorneys fees on Respondents for what is concededly in this case a reasonable, but ultimately unsuccessful, exercise of their statutory right to remove. And we think the answer to that answer to that question is clearly no, for two reasons. The first is that Section 1447(c) is not a fee shifting statute at all. Like its predecessor, Section 5 of the Act of March 3, 1875, Section 1447(c) just confirms the District Court's power to award fees, as well as costs, when it lacks subject matter jurisdiction and, therefore, must remand the case. There was a prior contrary common law rule, and the Act of March 3, 1875 abrogated it.</text>",2005

Plainly, this is a fundamentally important question, and the standard to be applied under section 704 is critically important to both employers and employees. And the respondent has given you truly a choice and not a shadow in this particular case because the respondent's analysis of section 704, based essentially on the language, any discrimination, is that everything that is in any sense against an employee, any act of retaliation, no matter how trivial, is nevertheless a basis for a section 704 lawsuit. This is a position that's embraced by none of her supporting amici. It's a position that's been embraced by no court of appeals up until this point, and it is a position that is utterly untethered in the relationship between section 704 and its language and section 703, which is the heart and soul of the antidiscrimination norms in title VII.</text>",2005

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- As this Court made clear recently in Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, since political candidates are the ones who take office, it is imperative that they be allowed freely to express themselves on matters of current public importance. As a result, this Court has never allowed the government to prohibit candidates from communicating relevant information to voters during an election. Vermont, however, has adopted low expenditure and contribution limits for the opposite purpose, reducing overall candidate campaign spending, and these limits would have that effect. This is fundamentally incompatible with any reasonable interpretation of the First Amendment and is not justified by any truly compelling governmental interest. As a result, they are unconstitutional. Now, Vermont's expenditure limits are an unprecedented, direct restraint on candidate speech.

This Court has never allowed the government to prohibit candidates from communicating this sort of relevant information during a campaign.

Now, the record is clear in this case that the expenditure limits will deprive candidates of substantial resources.

17347,2005.04-1618-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr.",You're... are you suggesting that the... the State would enjoy sovereign immunity in proprietary activities?,"<speaker>Dan Himmelfarb</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- States enjoy a constitutionally protected immunity from suit, but cities and counties do not. That principle has been established by an unbroken line of precedent dating back to the 19th century and was applied to an admiralty suit more than 100 years ago in Workman v. City of New York. Both Workman and the principle it applied answered the question presented in this case. Workman held that, as a matter of the Federal law of admiralty, a political subdivision is not entitled to immunity from suit. In the course of deciding that question, the Court explained that if the government entity defendant in an admiralty suit were a sovereign, it would be entitled to immunity, not as a matter of admiralty law, but as a matter of the law of sovereign immunity, in which case the Court would be without jurisdiction. The Court went on to say, however... and this is at page 570 of the opinion... the municipal corporation of the City of New York unlike a sovereign was subject to the jurisdiction of the Court. Workman's holdings resolved the issue in the case. But the result would be the same even if Workman had never been decided. From the Lincoln County case in 1890 through the Richland County case in 2003, this Court has repeatedly held that States, but not cities or counties, are sovereign and that States, but not cities or counties, are therefore entitled to sovereign immunity. A city or county is no more a sovereign in an admiralty case than it is in any other type of case. The theory on which the court of appeals apparently relied was that not only States but what it called political subdivisions of States are entitled to sovereign immunity, at least when the... the political subdivision is exercising a power delegated by the State. But that's no different from saying that cities and counties are, after all, entitled to sovereign immunity because every city or county is a political subdivision of a State and every city or county exercises power delegated by the State, what this Court has called a slice of State power. So the apparent rationale of the court of appeals is just flatly inconsistent with more than a century of this Court's precedent.</text>",2005

Woodman</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- Since the argument of the attorney general was addressed exclusively to the question of the constitutionality of the Kansas statute, I will devote all of my argument to that subject, as well, although I am sure that the Court, in deliberations, will be considering the several jurisdictional issues which were briefed and argued earlier in the term. And if there are no questions on those jurisdictional issues, I will proceed to the merits. To pick up on some of the things that were said during Attorney General Kline's argument, the eighth amendment requires reliability in the determination that death is an appropriate sentence. And at the selection stage, the question is whether the jury has made a reliable, collective, responsible decision based upon the unique circumstances of the individual defendant that death is an appropriate sentence and that this defendant is particularly culpable in a way that distinguishes him from the mass of death eligible defendants. And the problem with the equipoise provision here, which the State agrees can occur under the Kansas statute, is that we don't know from a death verdict pronounced by a jury in Kansas whether the jury did decree death by equipoise or not. Death sentences must be rationally reviewable. And when we look at the... at a death sentence that's been pronounced in Kansas, we can't determine whether the jury decreed death by equipoise.</text>",2005
17579,2005.04-1170-t02,petitioner,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","--was there a reason why they provided that, in the case of equipoise, the sentence would be death? Or is that just a quirk of the way the provision was written?","<speaker>Phill Kline</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- This Court has never held that a specific method of weighing aggravating and mitigating evidence is required, yet in its individualized sentencing line of cases this Court has consistently said that all the eighth amendment requires is that a juror consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence. In pages 23 through 28 of your appendix, you will find that Kansas jury instructions and Kansas law clearly, on four occasions, instruct individual jurors that they must individually consider all mitigating evidence that they find. Furthermore, the jurors are instructed in five different methods in which they can give that mitigating evidence the effect of a life sentence, and only one manner in which, acting unanimously and after the State has met the highest burden allowed by law in three separate measurements, beyond a reasonable doubt demonstrated that the death sentence is appropriate. Specifically, instruction number 4, paragraph 2 on page 24 of the joint appendix, will show the jurors are instructed that mercy, in and of itself, is a mitigating piece of evidence, and later, in the instruction that lays out the mitigating evidence presented in this specific case, they are told, in paragraph 18 on page 26 of your joint appendix, that mercy, by itself, can be sufficient to warrant a sentence other than death.</text>",2005

[Laughter] But I'm going to refrain, mindful of the fact that this is our... our second time through and try to hone in on... on what I think are some critical points. A search warrant, a judicial command, must be obtained from a neutral and detached magistrate. It must particularly describe the place to be searched and the things to be seized, and it must be issued based on probable cause drawn from information which is sworn to are affirmed... or affirmed. If these requirements are met, the privacy of the described premises will be invaded, and any privilege the occupants might have to withhold evidence or contraband from the police is abrogated. But that command must be executed in a reasonable fashion. And so the police may not bring third parties into the premises who are unnecessary to the execution of the warrant. They may not search in places where the items described may not be found. They may not cause unnecessary damage to property, and they may not use force to accomplish the entry unless consent to enter is denied either explicitly or implicitly or unless entering immediately is reasonable under the circumstances to avoid the destruction of the evidence or harm to the officers. If no valid warrant exists in the first place, then... and no exception exists, then the privacy of the dwelling has been unlawfully invaded. It never should have happened.

Our position is that Ideal's injury is too indirect as a matter of law under RICO. In reinstating Ideal's RICO claims against National, however, the Second Circuit committed two errors.

He wouldn't be covered by the same provision that we're talking about?","<speaker>Sri Srinivasan</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- Section 1231(a)(5) aims to streamline the removal of aliens who were already removed but have since illegally reentered. The Congress that enacted IIRIRA did not intend to grandfather the provision and exempt those aliens who are already in the country illegally. Rather, the focus on streamlining the rules for getting illegal reentrants out of the country is fully applicable, and, indeed, is especially applicable to illegal reentrants who were already in the country at the time of IIRIRA's enactment. Three considerations, I think, point to the conclusion that Section 1231(a)(5) is addressed to removing illegal reentrants from the country, including aliens who are already in the country, and that the provision is not so much addressed to the antecedent act of illegal reentry, as such. The first consideration I would point to is the operation of the provision. And it's useful to bear in mind the following possible scenario in which a person, who's been removed, illegally reenters the country, but then returns to his home country. Now, in that situation the individual would have engaged in the act of illegal reentry, but Section 1231(a)(5) simply would have no relevance to him whatsoever, because what Section 1231(a)(5) seeks to do is to remove someone who's found in the country on the basis of their previous removal order. Now, if they have engaged in the act of illegal reentry, but then have gone back, Section 1231(a)(5) simply is not relevant. And I think that goes to show that what the statute is focused on is not the act of illegal reentry, as such, but, rather, removing someone who's found in the country and who's determined to be an illegal reentrant. Now, that operation stands in significant contrast to the criminal prohibition against illegal reentry, which is at 8 U.S.C. 1326, and the prohibition against illegal entry, which is 8 U.S.C. 1325. With respect to both of those provisions, the act of illegal reentry, or the act of illegal entry, necessarily triggers the operation of the criminal prohibition, and there's nothing that the alien can do after the fact to take himself outside of the... of the purview of that criminal--</text>",2005

Could he start at the beginning, any continuance I grant is granted after my weighing the different factors set forth in the statute and it's in the ends of justice?","<speaker>Edward Scott Zas</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- The Speedy Trial Act protects the public, as well as the personal interests of defendants, by mandating the prompt disposition of Federal criminal prosecutions. In this case, the Government and the district court failed to comply with the clear requirements of the act. As relevant here, the act provides that the trial of a defendant who pleads not guilty and who is released on bail shall commence within 70 days after the indictment. The act, however, is not as inflexible as it sounds. The act permits numerous categories of delay to be excluded from the 70-day limit. The act also provides an enforcement mechanism. If more than 70 nonexcludable days elapse between the indictment and the trial, the indictment shall be dismissed. This case concerns two periods of delay, that each exceed the 70-day time limit, and I'd like to focus initially on the longer period of delay. This is the delay that took place between 2000 and 2001, after a competency proceeding was taken under advisement. Just to put this delay in context, a competency hearing was held on July 10, 2000. The judge solicited post hearing briefs. The matter was taken under advisement on August 23rd, and in our papers, we asked the judge to find petitioner competent and to set the matter for trial as soon as possible. We noted that at that point the case was already more than 4 years old. We offered to waive a jury and proceed to a bench trial immediately. And at that point, the case sat idle for the next 195 days. Now, the act excludes only the first 30 days of that period. That's section 3161(h)(1)(J). For reasons that have never been explained, the court sat on the proceeding. When 7 months went by, we filed a motion.</text>",2005

The first is that a defendant may not opt out of the act by waiver. The second is that a... a defendant is, nonetheless, precluded from challenging the grant of a continuance that he requested if the continuance satisfies the substantive ends of justice standards of the act and the defendant's waiver or other litigation conduct induced the court to commit the procedural error of not recording an ends of justice finding in the record. And the third related point, although it's not presented here, is that the courts of appeals have recognized that if a defendant requests an ends of justice continuance and the court in a procedurally regular manner grants the ends of justice continuance, the defendant cannot later be heard to contend that there was... the ends of justice were not really satisfied even though he had told the court that they were.

It's a... there's a lot of ambiguity in determining how much breadth to give that phrase.","<speaker>Jay B. Kasner</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- In an effort to limit State law securities class actions which undermine the market for nationally traded securities, Congress enacted SLUSA, a statute of broad preemption. SLUSA, which is reprinted at page 8(a) of Petitioner's blue brief, preempts, subject to three specific statutory extensions, all State law covered class actions, quote, ""by any private party who alleges misrepresentations, omissions, or fraudulent behavior in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security. "" The Second Circuit erred in implying an exception, that nowhere appears in the statutory language, and is wholly at odds with the purpose in the enactment of the statute for holders claims, a type of claim in which a plaintiff alleges, ""I did not purchase"" or ""I did not sell, but would have, had I known the allegedly false information. "" a type of claim which this Court, in Blue Chip Stamps, over 30 years ago, recognized as the most vexatious and abusive type of securities class action claims. The court below erred, for a number of different reasons. First and foremost, it completely violated the natural meaning of the statute. As I have mentioned, an examination of SLUSA, beginning at page 8(a), reflects that no covered class action may be maintained, quote, ""by any private party"", a clause that this Court, time and again, has interpreted as perhaps the broadest way of phrasing ""any and all private parties"" making certain types of allegations. Those allegations appear in (a) or (b), focusing on the conduct of the defendant in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security. Now, Congress could have... had it intended to inject a purchase/seller limitation, consistent with what the court below concluded, Congress could have phrased that language differently. As the Court is aware, in the both the 1933 and 1934 acts, Congress has made express causes of action, subject to an explicit purchase or seller requirement. For example, section 11 of the '33 act affords a private right of action to purchasers of securities in registered offerings. Section 12 affords a private right of action to persons from whom an offer or sale of securities. Section 9(e) of the '34 act, similarly, affords a purchase or seller requirement. Significantly, SLUSA nowhere speaks in terms of a purchase or sale. And it could have. For example, Congress could have provided that no covered class action by any private party alleging ""his or her sale"" of a covered security is preempted. It could have said, ""Any private party alleging a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the plaintiff or that party's purchase or sale. "" It did not. The decision of the court below is also at odds with this Court's teaching in United States versus O'Hagan, which was decided 1 year before SLUSA was enacted by Congress. In United States versus O'Hagan, this Court concluded that the so called ""misappropriation theory"" stated a viable claim in a criminal case brought by the United States Government.

Petitioners submit that Congress intended to require inmates to comply with administrative grievance procedures, for three principal reasons-- One, the established principle of exhaustion in the administrative law context requires a grievance... a grievant to timely comply with administrative agency proceedings. Two, in enacting the Prison Litigation Reform Act's exhaustion requirement, Congress was responding to this Court's decision in McCarthy v.

Yet, nearly a year into the case, after the parties had briefed the merits, the magistrate judge not only raised an argument that the petition was untimely, he actually imposed the State's limitations defense and dismissed the case, despite the State's procedural default and contrary concession. That was error, for two reasons. First, it violates the general principle of the adversary system in the civil rules that it's error to impose a forfeited limitations defense sua sponte, and the statutory text in rules have confirmed that this principle applies to habeas. Second, the State's concession of timeliness based on full information was an express binding waiver, and it was error for the District Court to override that concession.</text>",2005
