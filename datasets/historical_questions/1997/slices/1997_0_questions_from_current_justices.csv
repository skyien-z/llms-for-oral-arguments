11567,1997.96-1577-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Oh, it has broad jurisdictional significance. If land is Indian country, we start with the presumption that tribal and Federal jurisdiction controls, and that State jurisdiction is generally displaced. If land is not Indian country, State jurisdiction applies as it does in other areas, so it has significance not only with respect to taxes but to environmental regulation, hunting and fishing, gaming regulation, health and safety regulation, a broad range of day-to-day regulation. It answers the basic question, who is in charge? If it's Indian country, characterized throughout the country by the reservation, you know that the tribal government has sovereign authority and the Federal Government also has sovereign authority. If it's not Indian country, State law applies as it does generally throughout.","<speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text>Venetie, Venetie.</text>",1997
15770,1997.96-843-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","--It... it resounds throughout the legislative record. They say the reason we need this statute is because no one is in a position to provide small consumer loans. The small consumer couldn't put up adequate security for the bank to provide the loan. And it was usually in amounts too small for... for the banks to bother with. Over time, they have become competitors with credit unions. But the question is, did Congress view them as competitors in 1934? And did it enact the common bond provision to protect their status as competitors? And it is clear that they did not.","<speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice; and may it please the Court: I would like to pick up with Justice Kennedy's question: If the banks had known about this interpretation, they would have objected. First of all, that's beside the point. You don't get standing under the zone of interest test simply because you objected. Congress may not have accepted your objections.</text>",1997
15771,1997.96-843-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Well, I'll turn to that right now, Your Honor. The test is that the banks must show that Congress unambiguously expressed its intent on the precise question at issue. The precise question at issue is, may the multiple groups in a Federal credit union each have their own common bond or must they share a common bond? The language simply says: Federal credit union membership shall be limited to groups having a common bond. There is no way to tell from that, as a matter of common parlance or technical grammar, whether each group must have its own common bond or whether all of the groups in a Federal credit union must share the same common bond. It is simply ambiguous language.","<speaker>John G.

20506,1997.96-1768-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Oh, it's a mixed question of law and fact. It depends... and the legal standard was correctly stated. It depends upon whether each episode has what's called an independent copyright life, an independent economic value, and that's a question of fact. You take evidence on that. How was it copyrighted? How was it produced? How was it marketed? Would the television station show just one episode of a series or not? There are factual issues involved in that and then a legal standard to be applied, and we think what should have happened is that the jury should have been able to determine those facts based on proper instructions of the... what the legal test was.","<speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- In this case, a district judge determined that Mr. Feltner should pay Columbia Pictures 8.8 million in statutory damages for a copyright infringement. Before arriving at that figure, the judge held a bench trial, after which he made the factual finding that Mr. Feltner's conduct was willful, which increased the amount of damages which could be awarded under the statute. In light of clear historical practice on both sides of the Atlantic prior to 1971, Feltner had a right under the Seventh Amendment to have a jury make that finding and others on which the award was based and determine the amount of damages to be imposed within the statutory limits. Before reaching that constitutional question, however, we need to consider whether the statute may be construed to afford a jury trial right. It may be. First, the first Federal statute providing statutory damages in an amount ""as to the court shall appear to be just. "" the 1856 act, also provided that those damages should be recovered in an action on the case, a prototypical legal action for which a jury would be available. Statutory damages as to the court shall appear to be just, the samel terminology as employed in the 1856 act, were carried forward in successive acts up to the 1909 act, when the statutory damages provision took its modern form, with no indication that Congress wanted to delete the jury trial right that was so clearly present in 1856.</text>",1997
29138,1997.97-634-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas,"Just one question. The cases of ramps and some of the fixtures are fairly easy and straightforward cases, but we both know that in the employment context there's such a thing... reasonable accommodation includes reassignment. It also includes redesigning of jobs. Now, would you see... seek in this case a redesigning of the boot camp to accommodate a... an individual who is disabled in some way?","<speaker>Donald Specter</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Whether the ADA applies to State prisoners is not a close question. The words of the ADA are clear. The words are plain, and they cover State prisoners.

29139,1997.97-634-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas,"Yes, and... I understand that, but that's... we both know that that's tough. The... you can redesign jobs that fundamentally do the same thing, but with half the efficiency, so we know there's a problem there. Let me ask you one other question. Even though the accommodation may be different or reasonableness may take on a different meaning in the remedial context, the definition, very personalized definition of what is a disability, let's say someone has a disability, of course, of a psychological nature. That would have to be accommodated in prison, right?","<speaker>Donald Specter</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Whether the ADA applies to State prisoners is not a close question.

36251,1997.96-1279-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas,"--Mr. Rubinstein. Let's go back to page 104 of the joint appendix. I'm having a similar problem, a problem similar to Justice Breyer. It says here at the bottom, what must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant knowingly possessed the item as charged. Now, what was that item, as charged?","<speaker>Javier H. Rubinstein</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question before the Court in this case is whether the removal of an element by the trial court of an essential element of the crime with which a defendant is charged from the jury's consideration is the type of error that can be subject to harmless error scrutiny even if the defendant admitted the element by his testimony. We urge this Court to hold that it is not. In this case, it is undisputed that the trial court completely removed from the jury's consideration an element of the offenses with which petitioner was charged. Although the court of appeals recognized that there was an incomplete verdict, it nonetheless held that the error was subject to harmless error scrutiny because the trial court removed only one element of the offense.</text>",1997

36253,1997.96-1279-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas,"Mr. Nuechterlein, just a couple of clarifications. In the court of appeals' opinion, the court of appeals says, as discussed above the district court, over defense objection, refused to inform the jury that the Government had the burden of showing Rogers knew the item in questions were firearms under the act. In the question presented in this case, in the cert petition, the petitioner says that the trial court, over the objection of the defense counsel, the timely objection of defense counsel, refused to instruct the jury that the Government as an element of the offense charged was required to prove that petitioner knew the item in question was a firearm within the meaning of the statute. Now, does the Government concede that the failure to object that the silencer was a firearm is an error?","<speaker>Jonathan E.
