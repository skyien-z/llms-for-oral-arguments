2580,2001.01-631-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas,"Ms. Spivey, is there anything in the record about what the innocent people actually felt when the police officers came on the bus?","<speaker>Gwendolyn Spivey</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court should reaffirm Bostick in its entirety. We are not arguing that advice should be required. Rather, we think that Bostick got it entirely right with the language that advice is a factor particularly worth noting. If Bostick is revised, we would ask the Court to remand to the court of appeals, as it did in Bostick, so that it can reconsider. I believe the key to this test... and I don't mean to sound presumptuous. Having thought long and hard, I think the key is that the Eleventh Circuit really was trying to give voice to the seizure or... and the consent test, as set out in Bostick. In Bostick at U.S. 437, the Court wrote... it focused on what the police conduct... conduct would have communicated to a reasonable person. And in Washington at 1357 and Guapi at 1395, what the Eleventh Circuit focused on... it said, it is enough that the circumstances themselves would indicate that the search can proceed only if consent is given. So, I believe that the Eleventh Circuit parallels Bostick's use of the word... that focused on what does it communicate with their use of the word indicate. And indicate necessarily refers back to... it expressly refers back to the circumstances, which is the totality. And while courts tend to focus most commonly on whether or not advice was given or not given, I think there are any number of acts or omissions that focus on the police conduct--</text>",2001
3082,2001.01-679-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","In the implied right of action question there are two questions, did Congress intend to create a right, and did Congress intend to provide a judicial remedy? In the nineteen eighty-three context, there are two questions, did Congress intend to create a right, and did Congress intend to preclude resort to the nineteen eighty-three remedy, so that first question I think is the same under both categories of cases, and as the Court said in Cannon, if Congress phrases the statute as quo- quote, as a prohibition on the disbursement of public funds, there's far less reason to think that they intended a private remedy.","<speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: In nineteen seventy-four, when it en- enacted the Family Educational r- Rights and Privacy Act, Congress conditioned Federal funding for educational institutions on the institution not having a policy or practice of releasing student records without consent. Congress did not phrase this condition in terms of individual rights. It did not, for example, follow the model of title nine, enacted two years earlier and also dealing with educational institutions, and say something like, no student at a school receiving Federal funds shall have his records released without his consent. Instead, Congress proceeded more indirectly. It said that no funds shall be made available to any institution having a policy or practice of releasing student records without consent. The statute is directed to the Secretary of Education. He's the one who makes Federal funds available, not to the institution receiving the funds, and certainly not to the individual student. This Court's cases establish that that is a distinction that makes a difference. In Cannon, for example, the Court said there would be...</text>",2001
16345,2001.00-1770-t01,respondent,Clarence Thomas,"Mr. Lafayette, how big a problem is this in this housing authority?","<speaker>Gary T. LaFayette</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In response to Congress' enactment of 1437d(l)(6) and HUD's regulations, the Oakland Housing Authority revised its lease to properly reflect the changes that had taken place with regard to the HUD regulations. And it specifically did that in three instances. It revised the lease at paragraph 9(m) and it revised the occupants' responsibility statement, and then it revised what is known as the tenant agreement to maintain a drug-free environment. In each instance, it... it advised each tenant and requested each tenant to sign a statement acknowledging that they clearly understood that if this type of conduct took place within their apartment or off housing authority property, that they could be subjected to a lease cancellation. In this case, we came forward with four individuals whose leases were canceled because of this particular type of activity. And the housing authority's position is it was necessary for it to take the action with regard to each one of these particular individuals because of the conduct that they were participating in or the conduct of individuals in their households were participating in, which conduct which posed a significant risk of injury to other members of the housing authority and to the community in which these particular developments are located.</text>",2001
