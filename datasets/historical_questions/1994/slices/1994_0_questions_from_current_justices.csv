Let's say that the Georgia legislature, anticipating that they were going to have some difficulty in retaining the white vote... let's say, the Democrats... decided that our loyal constituent, 90-percent voters for the Democratic Party, are blacks, so now that we have this additional district, let's make sure that we have a solid Democratic district, and the Eleventh District was drawn solely to have a solid Democratic district, and to include the most loyal Democratic voters.

It has said that it is needed to guard against the appearance of impropriety, it has argued that this is a needed prophylactic measure, and it has also said that there are administrative reasons that justify the existence of the statute. Much of the discussion this morning has focused on the last justification. If I understand the Government correctly, it is agreeing that there is no appearance of impropriety when a career employee writes or speaks about something that has no connection to his job, and where the payor has no interest pending before the Government. But what the Justice Department seems to argue this morning is that even if that's the case, it's just too hard to enforce a nexus requirement, and with all respect to the Justice Department, I believe that that argument is just a bit thin. As we know, as Justice O'Connor has pointed out, the Achilles heel in each of the... with respect to each of the justifications here is the fact that an employee can receive compensation if he or she writes a series of articles, and, of course, what that means with respect to the statute is, you can't be paid if you write one or two articles, but if you repackage it as three or more, then you can be paid, provided there is no nexus to employment. It seems to us that the fact that there is a nexus test written right in the statute is very good evidence that a nexus test is eminently manageable. The question was raised earlier, what concrete experience do we have as to how much of a burden it is to administer a nexus requirement? Well, we would point the Court to a report that the Government believes, at least in its brief, supports its position, and I'm speaking here about the GAO report, which, of course, covered a 3-year period and examined outside activities that were engaged in by Federal employees. And if I read the report correctly, and added up the numbers correctly, there were about 2,500 employees who had received approval to engage in outside activities, the report identifies two instances where there were arguable improprieties with respect to the speaking activities.

Mr. Rosenthal intends on concentrating on the city's preemption argument. On April 13, 1992, the Chicago Loop flooded. Thousands of persons and businesses suffered losses estimated upwards of $1 billion. This catastrophe, which has now come to be known as the Chicago Flood, resulted from two occurrences. One was the City of Chicago's failure to maintain or repair an extensive underground tunnel system under the City of Chicago. The second was the pile-driving activities which occurred on the North Branch of the Chicago River to protect the Kinzie Street Bridge, which had been completed more than 6 months earlier. The pile-driving work was performed by Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company, the respondent here. It accomplished this work using a tractor crane positioned on top of a spud scow which had been posted into the river bed and which was being used as a stationary platform. On these facts, the Seventh Circuit, in reversing the district court, found that admiralty jurisdiction existed. In order to accomplish this, it had to do two things: 1) acting alone from the other circuits which have considered similar situations, it refused to adopt or use the totality-of-the-circumstances approach. Secondly, it misapplied the rulings of this Court.

37921,1994.93-762-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","It's a separate choice of law inquiry that doesn't... on which jurisdiction doesn't turn. We don't know yet. The allegations against us, and against the city, for that matter, run the gamut. We drove the pilings in the wrong location. We didn't pull up the old ones well enough before driving the new ones. We drove the new ones in too deeply. We failed to discover the tunnel. Whether Federal law or State law governs any of those claims is an issue that can't be decided at the jurisdictional stage. It's easy to imagine the desirability of a uniform Federal rule about the location of pilings. It's easy to imagine the desirability of a uniform Federal rule about how deeply they're driven. Vessels are lied against them both deliberately and inadvertently all the time. Jurisdiction doesn't turn on that, because to make jurisdiction turn on it would require us to answer the question, what actually caused this incident, and Sisson tells us jurisdiction doesn't turn on such an inquiry into the merits. What does it turn on? Whether the incident occurred on navigable waters, as this did, whether it poses a threat to maritime commerce, as this did, and whether it arose out of traditional maritime activity, as this plainly did. This is the strongest case for traditional maritime activity to come before this Court since it first articulated the nexus test in Executive Jet. For the first time, we have a commercial vessel. For the first time, we have navigable water actually used by commercial traffic, and for the first time, we have the actual conduct of commercial activity. Foremost, two tiny pleasure boats in an area not used by commercial traffic, Sisson, a pleasure yacht at a recreational marina, yet in each case this Court found admiralty jurisdiction because of the potential threat to maritime commerce and the substantial relation to maritime commerce. The case for jurisdiction is that much stronger here, where you have actual maritime commerce involved and directly affected. Now, the answer that what's involved is pile-driving is a red herring. They say pile-driving is a common activity, takes place on land all the time, rules are developed to deal with it. Well, the transportation of goods from point A to point B is also something that takes place on land all the time and as to which rules have been developed, but when it takes place on navigable water, you're in admiralty. The same is true with respect to marine construction. There are whole fleets of vessels designed for marine construction work, just like there are vessels designed for carrying cargo, people, for fishing, salvage, towing, rescue, ice-breaking, and when the marine construction vessels are out on the navigable waters plying their trade, they are as involved in traditional maritime activity, maritime commerce, the core of this Court's admiralty jurisdiction, to as great an extent as any of those other vessels are. Now, there's... the petitioner's answer to the Admiralty Extension Act is to rewrite it. It's worth recalling what it says: the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction shall extend to and include all cases... all cases... of damage or injury to person or property caused by a vessel on navigable water, notwithstanding that such damage or injury be done or consummated on land. Now, they read that as if Congress meant to say the jurisdiction shall extend to some cases of injury on land caused by a vessel on navigable waters. Those were the injuries within the reach of the vessel and reasonably contemporaneous with the negligent conduct giving rise to it, but those qualifications are found nowhere in the language of the statute or in its legislative history. Congress knows how to write a statute like that if it wants to. That's what it did in the Longshore and Harbor Workers Act. It said jurisdiction extends to the dock, to the water, to the pier... a laundry list of things near the shore. That's not the approach it took in the Admiralty Extension Act, and--","<speaker>Ben Barnow</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: In furtherance of the divided argument, I intend on concentrating on nonpreemption argument issues.

On what question? It's too early. Look what they ask a district court judge to do. A complaint lands on his desk. The district court judge apparently must decide, what are the dispositive legal issues going to be in this case? Then he or she must employ a choice-of-law analysis to decide whether Federal law is going to govern those dispositive issues or State law and then, finally, if it turns out, as will often be the case, there are more than one dispositive issue that might come up, apparently the judge has to weigh those governed by Federal law against those governed by State law, and somehow decide which interest predominates.

37923,1994.93-762-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","No. This is a rule of decision, and again, we don't know what the dispositive issues are going to be, because we don't know what caused this incident. Is it because we drove the pilings allegedly in the wrong location? Admiralty will have a lot to say... Federal uniform rules, a lot to say where pilings should be in navigable water. Is it because we drove the pilings too deeply? Admiralty will have a lot to say about that, too. Maybe State law will govern, but vessels come up against the pilings all the time, and perhaps a uniform Federal rule would be appropriate. That's not the sort of decision that is made at the preliminary jurisdictional stage. Instead, you look at more... the inquiry is, as the Seventh Circuit said, more structured. Did this incident occur on navigable waters? Yes. Did it pose a threat to maritime commerce? That's not seriously disputed. Did it arise from traditional maritime activity? This case involved the hiring of a vessel to perform services on navigable water, not freakish services, but what these vessels do, what they're designed to do all the time, maritime repair work, repair work that was directly related to navigation. Keep in mind, what I've been maintaining is this activity is itself traditional maritime activity. All that the test requires is that it be substantially related to that. These pilings protect vessels as well as bridges from the dangers of allisions. They serve as fulcrums in the tight channels such as underneath the Kinzie Street Bridge to turn barge traffic by being towed by tugboats. They operate as channel markers if they're in the right location, as to which Federal admiralty law will have something to say, and by protecting the drawbridge they protect maritime commerce, because, of course, if the drawbridge didn't work, the commerce couldn't get through. The relation to maritime commerce here is as strong as in any case to come before this Court since Executive Jet. Looking at the injury, taking into account, as they say, the totality of the circumstances, and focusing on where the injury occurred, is, in our view, inconsistent with the Admiralty Extension Act. It means that in two identical cases, one in which the injury is felt on navigable water, and the other in which the injury is felt on land, there will be jurisdiction in the former but not in the latter, despite the clear direction from Congress to the contrary. The test they propose, a totality of the circumstances, seven-factor, policy-based balancing test, is wholly unsuited to the jurisdictional inquiry. Jurisdictional rules need to be clear, precise, easy to apply, and lead to predictable results. Totality-of-the-circumstances balancing tests are by their nature vague, indeterminate, manipulable, and lead to different results, depending on who does the balancing, a particular concern in jurisdictional cases, because, of course, any appellate court must look at the question of jurisdiction sua sponte and reevaluate it as a matter of law. The Sisson test is more structured, it is more focused, it limits the activities that are pertinent, it doesn't look at injured parties, what they were doing, it focuses on what took place on navigable water. We have in this case an incident on navigable water that closed the Chicago River for more than a month. It arose from traditional maritime activity. The conclusion of the Seventh Circuit that that case was within admiralty was correct, and should be affirmed.","<speaker>Ben Barnow</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: In furtherance of the divided argument, I intend on concentrating on nonpreemption argument issues.
