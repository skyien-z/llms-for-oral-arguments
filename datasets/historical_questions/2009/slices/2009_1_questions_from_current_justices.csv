So that the time I spent figuring that out should be excluded from something? [Laughter]","<speaker>Mark T. Stancil</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Pretrial motion preparation time is not automatically excluded under Section 3161(h)(1) of the Speedy Trial Act. Such delays are subject to exclusion only on a case-by-case basis under (h)(7). I would like to focus today on three features of the statutory text that make that abundantly clear. First and foremost, when crafting (h)(1) Congress specifically addressed pretrial motion delays and precisely defined that exclusion. Subparagraph (D) declares that the exclusion shall begin with the filing of the motion and end with the hearing on or other prompt disposition of the motion. Reading the general language in (h)(1) to encompass preparation time would circumvent the deliberate legislative choice to limit the pretrial motion exclusion.</text>",2009

Now, I take your concern, Justice Ginsburg, this might be unfair to debtors who wouldn't be tipped off. That is not true here, where the trustee came to the creditors' meeting and said: I construe your exemption as limited, and I think the property is worth about $7,000 more, and I intend to sell it. And at that point, a debtor who really believed that her schedule claimed full value would, it seems to me, have said: You're misreading my schedule. She didn't do that.

34393,2009.08-1470-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor,"Excuse me. As I read this transcript, the police's tactic, by their own statement, was to approach him and say: This is our evidence. Explain yourself -- that's the words the officer used -- but he's entitled to an alternative explanation. Tell us. What's clear is that at no point did he answer those questions, because nothing about the nods of the head or anything else showed a willingness to confess. And even in the responses he gave, he answered a series of questions with a ""yes"", but not with an explanation, which was what was being requested. So my question is, how does one infer a voluntary statement from a situation in which someone's really not talking? I've never understood how a yes or a nod to questions that don't -- that's what the circuit said, to questions that we don't know what they were about -- do you want a mint or not, I don't even know that -- can reflect voluntariness?

I'd like to go right to some of the questions that this Court had about the language that was used in the Miranda decision and in the Butler decision. Both -- all of this language comes up in Butler. Now, Butler was a case not about the waiver of the right to silence, but a waiver of the right to counsel. So the suspect said ""I will talk to you"", but the North Carolina Supreme Court said: Well, we don't know if he waived his right to counsel, and that's why the court got into a question of implied waiver. So the Court in its analysis in Butler first reviewed this language that the Court has talked about this morning from Miranda that says ""A valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained. "" And this is our understanding of that language: First, it is not the case that a failure to invoke Miranda rights will be taken in the Miranda context as a waiver. Now, Justice Scalia, I think you alluded to the fact that the normal rule for the Fifth Amendment at trial is that you assert your rights or they are waived. But Miranda's an exception to that, that the failure to assert we are not going to take as a waiver. The government has to do something more.</text>",2009
