Shah</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: By its plain terms, section 233(a) precludes any civil action against officers and employees of the Public Health Service arising out of performance of their medical duties. Instead, it makes an action against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act the exclusive remedy for injury arising out of PHS-provided care. Unlike the Westfall Act, section 233 contains no carve-out for constitutional claims, nor is there any textual basis for which to imply one. Accordingly, this Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision allowing Respondents' Bivens claims against the individual Petitioners on top of their FTCA claims against the United States. Now, even assuming Congress did not specifically have Bivens claims in mind at the time that they enacted this statute, that's no reason to limit the plain terms of section 233(a). First, Justice Kennedy, going to your question about whether there's authority for that proposition that when Congress doesn't specifically anticipate a certain set of facts yet the plain terms control, that that is the correct result, this Court has stated both in the RICO context as well as in other contexts that the fact that Congress doesn't specifically contemplate application of the statute to particular circumstances simply demonstrates the breadth of the statute and not any ambiguity. Those statements are set forth on page 15 of our brief, Sedima, Yeskey, and others. The second point I would make is the best indication of Congress's broad intent is simply the plain terms of the statute. Congress could have enacted a statute that only provided immunity for, say, negligent performance of medical duties. It included no such limitation in 233(a). It could have made the FTCA remedy exclusive of, say, only common law causes of action or State law causes of action, or even existing causes of action. It did not do that.

793,2009.08-998-t01,respondent,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Why don't you follow his suggestion and just move the 6-month period, because the statute specifically grants that authority to the judge?","<speaker>Thomas C. Goldstein</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court, I think, has the parties' arguments very well in hand. I think the -- the one point that I can hopefully address, and it is I think the hardest part of our case, is to address the issue that Justice Alito raised, and that is, is there an anomaly in the fact that in BAPCPA Congress added the 6-month period, which would suggest perhaps that Congress was trying to lock in a particular period that we would look at. And the answer to that question is no, and I want to take you to the relevant statutory provisions. Everything is going to be in the cert petition. I am going to start in the petition appendix at 91, which is 1325, which is the operative provision here. And 1325(b)(1) tells us that if the trustee or a creditor objects, then as of the effective date of the plan it's only going to be confirmed in subsection (b), which is the third full paragraph on page 91 is going to control. The plan has to provide that all of the debtor's projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period beginning on the date the first payment is due under the plan will be applied to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan. And the thing to note first about that provision is that it, too, sets a timetable. It's not just projected disposable income, but it's projected disposable income of a very particular type, to be received in the applicable commitment period. So unless there is something particularly strange about the definition of ""disposable income"", Congress specified a period that the income is going to be measured in, and that's over the course of the plan; the word ""projected"" tells us to get a realistic estimation of what that amount of money's going to be. Now, my friend makes the point that disposable income after BAPCPA is a defined term; the definition comes in the next paragraph; it's subsection (2), 1325(b)(2). For purposes of this subsection the term ""disposable income"" means current monthly income received by the debtor subject to some deductions and then the expenses. So then we have to go to the definition of ""current monthly income"". Current monthly income is in 101; it's at page 83. That's where we get the 6-month period. And it tells us that current monthly income is the average monthly income from all sources, so it's very encompassing, without regard to whether such income is taxable income derived during the 6-month period. So, my friend's argument is that, well, Congress said 6 months. The answer to that point is a couple fold. First, as was suggested in the first half-hour, Congress was addressing a very specific problem there. Before BAPCPA courts didn't know what the -- didn't agree on what the baseline was for determining someone's income. Some courts would say, all right, you are a Chapter 13 debtor, right away I'm going to look at the latest month. Some courts said 6 months. We have a court in our brief that said 4 years. So, we have to have a starting point to project from. But the second point is that this term 13 term at all.

794,2009.08-998-t01,respondent,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.",Can I ask you this? There seems to be at least a subtle difference between your position and the government's position. You say that the projected disposable income will be different from the disposable income calculated during the lookback period when it is known or virtually certain that there will be differences in income or expenses. And the government says that there is a difference when something is likely to occur in the future. Where do you -- where do you get from the statute your known or virtually certain differences?,"<speaker>Thomas C. Goldstein</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court, I think, has the parties' arguments very well in hand. I think the -- the one point that I can hopefully address, and it is I think the hardest part of our case, is to address the issue that Justice Alito raised, and that is, is there an anomaly in the fact that in BAPCPA Congress added the 6-month period, which would suggest perhaps that Congress was trying to lock in a particular period that we would look at. And the answer to that question is no, and I want to take you to the relevant statutory provisions. Everything is going to be in the cert petition. I am going to start in the petition appendix at 91, which is 1325, which is the operative provision here. And 1325(b)(1) tells us that if the trustee or a creditor objects, then as of the effective date of the plan it's only going to be confirmed in subsection (b), which is the third full paragraph on page 91 is going to control. The plan has to provide that all of the debtor's projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period beginning on the date the first payment is due under the plan will be applied to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan. And the thing to note first about that provision is that it, too, sets a timetable. It's not just projected disposable income, but it's projected disposable income of a very particular type, to be received in the applicable commitment period. So unless there is something particularly strange about the definition of ""disposable income"", Congress specified a period that the income is going to be measured in, and that's over the course of the plan; the word ""projected"" tells us to get a realistic estimation of what that amount of money's going to be. Now, my friend makes the point that disposable income after BAPCPA is a defined term; the definition comes in the next paragraph; it's subsection (2), 1325(b)(2). For purposes of this subsection the term ""disposable income"" means current monthly income received by the debtor subject to some deductions and then the expenses. So then we have to go to the definition of ""current monthly income"". Current monthly income is in 101; it's at page 83. That's where we get the 6-month period. And it tells us that current monthly income is the average monthly income from all sources, so it's very encompassing, without regard to whether such income is taxable income derived during the 6-month period. So, my friend's argument is that, well, Congress said 6 months. The answer to that point is a couple fold. First, as was suggested in the first half-hour, Congress was addressing a very specific problem there. Before BAPCPA courts didn't know what the -- didn't agree on what the baseline was for determining someone's income. Some courts would say, all right, you are a Chapter 13 debtor, right away I'm going to look at the latest month. Some courts said 6 months. We have a court in our brief that said 4 years. So, we have to have a starting point to project from. But the second point is that this term 13 term at all.

Conway III</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed for two reasons. First, Petitioners have identified nothing in the text of section 10(b) that overcomes the presumption against extraterritoriality or the Charming Betsy Rule. The statutes should thus be construed not to apply to transactions and shares of foreign issuers on foreign exchanges. Second, unlike the rights of action that this Court has addressed in other extraterritoriality cases, the section 10(b) right is purely implied. Congress didn't intend for this right of action to exist even domestically, let alone extraterritorially. Given the threat that the section 10(b} implied right presents to the sovereign authority of other nations, as reflected in the amicus briefs of Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and the diplomatic note from the Swiss government, the Court should construe the implied right not to extend to claims of purchasers and sellers of securities of foreign issuers on foreign markets. The two clear statement rules are, obviously, the presumption against extraterritoriality and the Charming Betsy Rule. Both require an affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed before the statute can be applied to apply to foreign transactions or to, you know, matters that it infringes on the sovereign authority on other nations. My friends don't identify anything in the statute that comes even close to a clear statement.

Why can't they just take 54 days at the end of every year that there is actual service, and that the time served, plus whatever number of days have been earned, you subtract it from the term of imprisonment? So if he was imprisoned for 10 years, he got 540 days for whatever it is. At the end of the 9th year, he made up whatever -- you added up 9 times 54, and you took it away from 10.

And I think that the answer to this question comes from the text of the statute, particularly if you compare the two things that are in 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) and (ii), that all of the things that are listed in (i) and that are covered by (ii) are subsumate decisions that are made by the Executive in the immigration context as a matter of grace, things that involve whether aliens can stay in the country or not. And those are matters, at the end of the day, that the Executive, in the exercise of its immigration and foreign affairs power, has the authority to decide and that Congress did not want the Federal courts in the business of reviewing. But what the Federal courts have often reviewed are things where discretion is committed by regulation, and these are procedural matters that relates to whether an alien had a fair shot of getting his claim heard by the agency and by the Federal courts.

Under Rule 52(b), a defendant asserting a forfeited claim of error may prevail only by showing at a minimum a reasonable possibility that the error actually affected the outcome of the case. In particular, the fourth prong of the Olano plain error test requires a defendant to show a serious effect on the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.

Yang</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: I would like to address a few of the questions that have come up already. Justice Sotomayor you asked what Supreme Court decision addresses the receiving carrier. There is a series of decisions which address receiving carriers and the nature of the receiving carrier as the initial care that receives goods from the shipper. I would -- Mexican Light and Power Company, 1947, is probably the best, but that traces its way back all the way to the 1910s, Galveston Wharf Company, Ward, Starburg, Lish Milling, Riverside Mills. These cases are largely cited at our brief at page 27 to 28, footnote 10. Regarding the geographic scope of Carmack on the current text, we believe that the current text, which is reproduced in the petition appendix at 69a -- if you look at the combination of both the first and the third sentences of Carmack, we believe that that reproduces the historic scope as encompassing only domestic transportation, purely domestic transportation, and transportation to an adjacent foreign country when it's an export. The first sentence requires that the rail carrier be providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the board and issue a receipt or bill of lading. The very purpose of Carmack from the very beginning, its core purpose, was to allow a shipper to sue the initial carrier. The initial carrier was responsible for the entire shipment. All the connecting carriers were deemed to be agents of the initial carrier and therefore there was an easy defendant for the shipper who dealt directly with that shipper -- or that carrier, and received a bill of lading from that carrier to sue.</text>",2009

Cohen</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Plaintiff's counsel in this case earned a large fee award based on prevailing market hourly rates and a substantial number of hours expended. However, the district court determined that the $6 million lodestar was insufficient to compensate them for the quality of their representation or their results obtained. This Court has previously held that factors, such as novelty and complexity of the issues, contingency, and superior performance cannot be used to increase the lodestar amount because the factors are subsumed within that determination. But because of this Court's indication that, in rare or exceptional circumstances, upward adjustments may be permissible, district courts, such as the one below, have used quality and results to increase lodestar awards, even though the -- the multiplication of the reasonable number of hours expended times the reasonable hourly rate constitutes a fully compensatory fee and serves the purpose of the statute, which is to attract competent counsel without providing a windfall. Now, with respect to quality of representation, that normally involves two factors: the skill and experience of the attorney, and also the effort it takes to succeed in the case.

This Court has previously held that factors, such as novelty and complexity of the issues, contingency, and superior performance cannot be used to increase the lodestar amount because the factors are subsumed within that determination. But because of this Court's indication that, in rare or exceptional circumstances, upward adjustments may be permissible, district courts, such as the one below, have used quality and results to increase lodestar awards, even though the -- the multiplication of the reasonable number of hours expended times the reasonable hourly rate constitutes a fully compensatory fee and serves the purpose of the statute, which is to attract competent counsel without providing a windfall.

The alleged lost opportunity to tax was based on claims that my clients and 50 other defendants in four consolidated cases did not send names of customers to the State of New York and had statements on their website saying sales were tax-free and no tobacco taxes applied. The Federal district court dismissed all claims. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated one of the city's RICO claims against the Petitioners, the Hemi Group and its sole owner, Kai Gachupin, and affirmed dismissal of the city's other RICO and its common law fraud claims. Yet reinstating the one RICO claim was improper because the city does not have standing to sue, based on the injuries that it has alleged. It does not have standing because the city's claim that it lost the sovereign opportunity to tax is not an injury to -- to business, and it's not an injury to property.</text>",2009

The government cannot point to a single defendant under this provision for the conduct at issue who has ever received more than 10 years in prison absent the use of a machinegun. We cited a long string of cases in the O'Brien brief and the government's response in its reply brief was silent. So, therefore, the government is here today claiming that it is entitled, based on the fact of a machinegun, to get 20 years more than any defendant that perpetrated this conduct has ever gotten, and indeed 18 more years than the government itself asked the district judge in this case for, once the machinegun provision was off the table, under the guise that this is nothing more than a sentencing factor. We think that this Court's statutory interpretation jurisprudence as well, if necessary, this Court's constitutional jurisprudence foreclose such a result. Let me start with statutory interpretation. On the government's theory in 1998, Congress stepped in and took a statute that made machinegun use an element and transformed it into -- into a sentencing factor. In other words, Congress, without a peep, a mutter, or anything, and in -- in the course of doing something entirely different, which was reacting to this Court's Bailey decision, stepped in and took a fact that formerly had to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt to trigger a 30-year sentence and left that same sentence in place but now allowed it to be proved to a judge by a preponderance, based on a presentence report, and, indeed, according to the government, also stripped away the mens rea requirement that attached to the statute when it was an element.</text>",2009

The first one is that the unvarnished text of the statute is vague, amorphous, open-ended, and essentially, not very helpful. The second one is that a meaningful attempt to construe the statute can take place, if at all, only in light of a body of law that this Court rejected in McNally and Congress likely intended to restore in the act. And the third is that this exercise is fraught with due process and federalism problems and risks the creation of common law crimes, especially in the private sector where the pre-McNally precedent was not well-developed. The principal question in this case is whether a prosecution may be sustained under a 1346 theory, under a theory that was not successful before McNally and, in fact, had been affirmatively rejected, even in the heyday of the intangible rights doctrine. Because the answer to that question is ""no"", all convictions in this case must be reversed. It would be well to start by acknowledging that the root difficulty in this case is that this Court asked Congress to speak clearly, and Congress did not do that. As a result, there is no solution that is really capable of providing an -- an elegant out to the morass that the lower courts have been confronting, but the choices, essentially, fall on three categories. And the first is to return the matter to Congress, either because the statute is vague in all of its applications, both public or private, or as to private conduct, because there are not enough guideposts for judicial decision-making to give meaning to the statute.

34393,2009.08-1470-t01,respondent,Sonia Sotomayor,"Excuse me. As I read this transcript, the police's tactic, by their own statement, was to approach him and say: This is our evidence. Explain yourself -- that's the words the officer used -- but he's entitled to an alternative explanation. Tell us. What's clear is that at no point did he answer those questions, because nothing about the nods of the head or anything else showed a willingness to confess. And even in the responses he gave, he answered a series of questions with a ""yes"", but not with an explanation, which was what was being requested. So my question is, how does one infer a voluntary statement from a situation in which someone's really not talking? I've never understood how a yes or a nod to questions that don't -- that's what the circuit said, to questions that we don't know what they were about -- do you want a mint or not, I don't even know that -- can reflect voluntariness?

Saharsky</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent's confession was properly admitted at his trial. I'd like to go right to some of the questions that this Court had about the language that was used in the Miranda decision and in the Butler decision. Both -- all of this language comes up in Butler. Now, Butler was a case not about the waiver of the right to silence, but a waiver of the right to counsel. So the suspect said ""I will talk to you"", but the North Carolina Supreme Court said: Well, we don't know if he waived his right to counsel, and that's why the court got into a question of implied waiver. So the Court in its analysis in Butler first reviewed this language that the Court has talked about this morning from Miranda that says ""A valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained. "" And this is our understanding of that language: First, it is not the case that a failure to invoke Miranda rights will be taken in the Miranda context as a waiver. Now, Justice Scalia, I think you alluded to the fact that the normal rule for the Fifth Amendment at trial is that you assert your rights or they are waived. But Miranda's an exception to that, that the failure to assert we are not going to take as a waiver. The government has to do something more.</text>",2009
