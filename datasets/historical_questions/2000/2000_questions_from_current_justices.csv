2763,2000.99-1571-t01,petitioner,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","--I think Justice Brandeis' opinion in Kellogg answers that. Kellogg did not have to show that there was no way to make or sell shredded wheat other than in the pillow-shaped biscuit form that Nabisco had made famous when it had its patent. It was enough that that was the form in which Nabisco had practiced its patent. Kellogg therefore could copy it, even though they could have made shredded wheat some other way, and that's important precisely because of the purpose of the patent bargain to promote competition. As I said, why... if we have an improvement to this sign stand, the step-and-drop legs, why should we have to add it only to a very different sign stand? It's the commercially proven version that the public has the right to copy. That is important to enhance competition. To require people, if they're going to make improvements, to design around the form that the public had become accustomed to, would inhibit competition, and--","<speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The president and founder of Marketing Displays, Incorporated, MDI, invented a new type of sign stand, one with a dual-spring design that allowed the stand to resist the wind. MDI patented that invention and, for the term of its patents, MDI labeled its sign stands as patent-protected to warn of copiers, touted in its trade literature the benefit of its, quote, patented dual-spring design, end quote, and when another company, Windproof, tried to market a copy of MDI's patented stand, MDI sued it for patent infringement and won. But then MDI's patents expired, as under the Constitution all patents eventually must. Sometime thereafter, Traffix Devices, the petitioner, copied MDI's stand, added some improvements of its own, and marketed a competing version. No longer armed with its patents, MDI tried a new tack to exclude competition. It claimed that the configuration of its stand, the same dual-spring design that it had touted as patent-protected during the term of the patents, was protected as trade dress and could not be copied.</text>",2000

Roberts, Jr.","--With respect to the one strike I think the regulations would prevent that in most situations, because they contemplate that in some circumstances you can be reinstated, so there should not be an absolute rule of one strike and you're out. Now, the objection Your Honor raises is the same objection that could have been raised in the Town of Newton case. How do you tell which release dismissal agreement violates the policies underlying section 1983? It's an objection that has been raised with respect to the public policy exception since the beginning. Go back to the Muschany case and even before that. And yet the exception has endured because the courts have recognized that if courts do not ensure that contracts do not violate public policy, no one else can.","<speaker>John G. Roberts, Jr.</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court-- Twice the driver in this case tested positive for illegal drugs, and twice the company that employed him to drive its 25-ton vehicles in West Virginia tried to fire him. Each time an arbitrator ordered the driver reinstated. The second time the company went to court, arguing that the reinstatement award should not be enforced because it was contrary to public policy to put this driver back behind the wheel. The district court and the court of appeals, however, rejected that argument and concluded that because reinstatement was not illegal, the public policy exception to the enforceability of contracts, quote, does not apply, unquote.</text>",2000

Arceneaux, III</speaker><text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents a simple issue, whether the Fourth Circuit's decision in this case that a party is not a prevailing party unless they obtain a judgment, consent decree, or settlement is in accordance with this Court's prior decisions and the intent of Congress in establishing the term, prevailing party, in the Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Award Act of 1976, commonly referred to as section 1988, and the two statutes at issue in this case, the Fair Housing Amendments Act, and the Americans With Disabilities Act. When Congress enacted all three of these fee-shifting statutes, it did not condition an award of fees only upon the result of a judgment, consent decree, or settlement.
