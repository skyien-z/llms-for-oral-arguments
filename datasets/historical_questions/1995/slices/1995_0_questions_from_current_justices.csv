2903,1995.94-1893-t01,petitioner,Clarence Thomas,"--All that is well and good, but to date has that changed, and are cable companies competitive with each other, or are they equally in the monopoly position, and are we just talking about monopolists versus monopolists?","<speaker>Lawrence G. Wallace</speaker><text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The provision of the 1984 cable act that the court of appeals invalidated in this case, section 533(b) of title 47, addresses the special capacity for anticompetitive conduct by local telephone companies in providing cable television programming services. That capacity stems from the telephone companies' established situation as regulated monopolies, and it is important to an understanding of the premises on which the commission and Congress have acted over the past 25 years not to elide too quickly over what it has meant for these companies to be regulated monopolies. They have in the first place been given exclusive franchises. The Virginia statutory provision involved in this case is set forth in footnote 17 of the district court's opinion on page 77a of our appendix to the petition, which protected them against competition in providing the telephone services regulated on the basis of recovery of costs and return of capital type of rate regulation still the predominant and historically the only form of rate regulation to which they've been subject in providing telephone service. They've been granted rights of way sometimes with the exercise of the power of eminent domain to construct poles and conduits and their expenses in doing so have been included as part of their rate base, so at the advent of modern cable television, when it was replacing the old community antenna systems, they had not only the capacity to provide wire service throughout the communities they served, they had the wires in place to virtually every residence and a capacity through their Government-sponsored regulated monopolies to stifle the development of any other competition in the provision of cable television services. I don't mean to suggest that any of this was in any way improper. Obviously, this served an important public interest on the part of the local governments in assuring that telephone service would be available throughout their communities at a reasonable cost. But the situation with which the commission and Congress have been concerned is that not just through their legitimate use of the advantage that they had were they in a position to stifle the development of others in providing these services, but they also would have the capacity incentive to use unfair competitive methods.</text>",1995
