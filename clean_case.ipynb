      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: What are the immunities set forth in the Westfall Act? I thought that they were -- they applied to all Federal employees?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: But it seems to me that, quite apart from the Westfall Act, there's a more -- more basic answer that you would make to Justice Sotomayor's question. And that is, because the nature of immunity clauses are to make the employees secure against unforeseen causes of action as well as foreseen. I think that's a principled answer you could make. If I made that answer, do you have authority I could cite for that proposition?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: If we limit it, then Congress would have to reenact a statute every time there was some new cause of action?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: And that's a -- there's a ceiling, because the Tort Claims Act refers to the law of the place where the act or omission occurred. In this case it's California?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Which would put a lid on the damages, since this is a death case, of 250,000?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: --May I ask you to comment on the fact that, in the Carlson case, apparently the assistant surgeon general was, in fact, a defendant, and the government failed to make this defense?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Mr. Shah, is that -- is that the same -- in all the statutes that Carlson cites on page 20, when they say that Congress follows the practice of explicitly stating what it means to make the FTCA an exclusive remedy, there's this -- the Gonzalez Act and there's 233(a), and then there is the swine flu. Are they all -- are all those provisions, provisions like 233(a), that say \"any civil action\"?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: Can you tell me how many PHS personnel work in settings outside custodial settings?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: --And is there a reason Congress would want to immunize PHS personnel against Bivens claims in a custodial setting, but not immunize Bureau of Prison personnel?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Are they paid less than other -- than other Federal employees who perform similar functions? And what do -- what do physicians who are not -- were not employees of the Public Health Service do about liability for Bivens actions? Are they responsible for getting their own malpractice insurance?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Of course, we're -- you know, we're talking here as though Congress is a perpetual unchanging institution. Why would it have done this for Public Health Service employees and not have done this for Bureau? It wasn't the same Congress that passed those two Acts. The one may have been a stingier Congress than the other, or there -- there may have been more lobbying by one of the other groups in one case. I don't see any reason why we have to philosophically reconcile the -- the granting of -- of greater immunity to Public Health Service employees.\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Just as a matter of curiosity, do all of these immunity provisions come out of the same committee? Or can one assume that the Public Health Service may have come out of one committee of Congress, the Bureau of Prisons may have come out of another committee of Congress, the DOD may have come out of a third committee of Congress?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: If section 2679(b)(2), instead of saying paragraph (1) does not extend nor apply, had said the remedy against the United States provided by sections 1346(b), et cetera, and repeated that language from (b)(1), and then said: \"Is not the exclusive remedy in any civil action against an employee of the government. \" and continued with subsection (2), then the result here would be different, wouldn't it?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Could the -- could the plaintiff contest the certification that this was within the scope -- and say it was so egregious, it was outside the scope, and, therefore, it doesn't come -- come within 233(a) or anything else, and so we have a straight claim against the defendants?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Or they would lose their argument against the -- I mean, they would lose their claim against the government if they were taking that position?\n",
      "\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: You claim the Westfall Act implicitly repealed 233(a)? Is that what you say?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: I don't understand your Westfall Act argument. I must be missing something. My understanding is, many years ago, Congress passes a statute and says: Give absolute immunity from Bivens actions. Sue the government; don't sue the employee. It says that, basically. A long time ago. Then, sometime after, Congress passes another statute, and in paragraph (a) of that statute, it says: An even larger group of people, just sue the government. And then it says: As to this larger group of people, paragraph (1) of this statute doesn't apply to Bivens actions. So, what does that got to do with this earlier statute? Doesn't it refer to it. I don't -- in other words, I understand your Carlson argument. I got that one, but I don't understand this argument if I have the statutes right.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Well, is there an answer to the question? Because that would be important.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: I understand that one. The one I don't understand is what's the relation of the Westfall Act to this argument?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Yes, right. They give the government employees the same kind of immunity that -- a little more limited, and that's in paragraph (1). And then paragraph (2) says: Paragraph (1) doesn't apply to Bivens actions. It doesn't say anything about the earlier statute. It applies to a different group of people. It has all kinds of requirements, nothing involved with 233. Okay. So, what is it to do with this case? Now, what I'm thinking now from your hesitation is it has nothing to do with the case; it's the Carlson thing that is the important thing. Now, you tell me why I'm wrong.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: I just say, what does the Act have to do with this older Act?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Westfall -- Westfall Act is not -- is not the FTCA, is it?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Well, you say any -- any other civil action that -- that did not exist prior to the enactment of 233(a) would not be covered by its exclusion because Congress couldn't have known that this civil action existed, so that it only covered those causes of action that existed at the time the statute was passed?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Why? I mean, if your theory is it doesn't preclude anything they didn't know about, if they didn't know about something, whether it's constitutional or not, what -- what reason is there to say it's precluded?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: And Carlson is your best authority for that? Even though I don't think Carlson is directly on point, Carlson is still your best authority?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: In a different context, but that -- but Carlson is still your best authority for that proposition?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Do think your clear statement argument would apply even if Carlson had been decided before the statute was enacted?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But you say the same thing -- even though Bivens was before Congress -- and even though the Gonzalez Act doesn't have an exception for Bivens claims, you read one into the Gonzalez Act?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Legislative history will do, so -- so we don't require this clear statement, right?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Now you're confusing me again. [Laughter] Is -- is -- is important what Congress was thinking or what Congress said? I thought your proposition was, unless the statute says that it bans constitutional actions, it doesn't. Is that your proposition?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Then it doesn't matter what Congress was thinking, does it? Unless Congress says that, your -- your position is--\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: You're not abandoning it; you're taking it further. You're taking Carlson further. It doesn't have to be -- no?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: May I just be sure I understand your argument? Is the Westfall Act -- would it have covered every immunity that the Public Health Act previously provided? So, is it correct that the -- the prior statute is now totally unnecessary and does nothing except preserve the Bivens -- preserve the immunity for Bivens actions?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Can't they sue the Federal Government and collect money?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: No, I mean, can't your clients -- anybody who has a case like yours -- can't they sue the Federal Government and collect damages for their claim?\n",

      "Byron R. White: [Inaudible] if it acts strictly based on the evidence doesn't have reason to believe so and so and concern that there are duties when spoken of the statute. You may disagree with it but how can you say that they have many obligations to represent here?\n",
      "Byron R. White: I know that they are representing it because they have a duty to represent everybody?\n",
      "Byron R. White: I think that the statute, and you agree that unless the United States generates some reason or believing that as practices it had a discriminatory practice, it's supposed to concern?\n",
      "Byron R. White: And so that it has itself assessed the evidence and if it feels that it has no reason not to consent it’s supposed to consent?\n",
      "Byron R. White: And it has opportunity presented contrary to the Court?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: Well I know, but I take it from what you now said Mr. Greenberg, on the face of the statute, they didn’t have to represent you and that is why -- if you -- now if you concede that then don’t you automatically satisfy the first requisite of the intervention?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: Well I know but this statute does provide just as Mr. Justice White said that there is a duty on the United States to consent in certain circumstances?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Would you have thought Mr. Greenberg that you would have been fully as entitled to intervene before they filed their consent as after? I think they could be making the same argument if you had filed before?\n",

      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: -- sustained the lower court, you are saying it is meaningless anyway because they can go back and do it all over again?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: Right and then the issues then of intervention of right or permissive intervention that arise again?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: Might a Court not hold a permissive intervener to stricter time requirement into an intervener as a bright that that being that it really doesn’t have to get in anyway and therefore your resolve time judgments against him whereas in the case of intervention of right you may allow more latches?\n",

There is a little difference between the theory of the mass action theory which I guess makes the union liable for -- in effect for the strike itself.

You maybe seated if you like Mr. Henkin now. You maybe seated until they get to the correction here. Mr. Wong, I think what we'll do is take a brief recess until you can find the mechanical problem here. [Recess] Now, you may proceed Mr. Henkin, I think we're functioning again.\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Mr. Henkin, before you start. Would you clear up something I had missed in the briefs? You keep -- you mentioned two or three times that Mrs. Lalli, the original respondent is no longer party to the case in effect. Is the case moot?\n",

      "John Paul Stevens: Would you tell me one other thing. I'm not sure I understood you answer to Mr. Justice Blackmun. He asked you if there -- whether there's a lot of money involved or small amount. You answered by saying there's a $100,000.00 bond posted I don't really know how that answers the question.

How can you say that and say that the, say five years after birth the father dies and still the child must be barred?\n",

Well, supposing the papers of the father and there is abundant evidence to the fact that he is not just as, sort of someone ambiguous what you have here, but he is repeatedly acknowledged it, written it out many, many times that the person involved is my true and natural son. What is the state interest in giving such a father an opportunity to contradict what he has said repeated, when he said repeatedly to the contrary?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Till we make to say in terms of standard of proof. You might require proof beyond all doubt, beyond a unreasonable doubt, something like that. But when you have un-contradicted proof and there are all agreement on the fact, and I know you don't have that here, then, what's the state interest?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: And then, do you not discriminate against some illegitimates?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: The sole justification according to you is to protect the right of the father to testify to the contrary when the record makes it clear he has no such desire?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: What you're saying perhaps is that New York is not obliged to have a perfect statute, so long as they have a reasonable one?\n",

Now, going along the way... maybe I'm making a mistake to point it out, if I am... but I go to the key thing here, which is the words in 924(c), What is a \"drug-trafficking crime\"? A \"drug-trafficking crime\" is a crime... \"any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. \" That could mean an act, physically, that is a felony under some law, and is also punishable under the Controlled Substances Act as a misdemeanor. Okay? Felony under... it could pick that up. And it also could mean any conduct which is punishable as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act. And I could look at those words a thousand times and not have a clue which it means. So, I thought of an empirical test. This statute, 924(c), happens to be a statute that, if you engage in a drug-trafficking crime, as defined, and you have a gun with you, you get mandatory 5 years. That's the point of it. And the Government does all the prosecuting. So, in how many cases where a person committed a misdemeanor offense, simple possession, and had a gun, did the Government insist that they get the 5 years minimum? Now, if you're prepared to tell me \"a lot of 'em\", I'm prepared to tell you, the Government has consistently interpreted the statute the way you are now.

But, if we're asking, \"What is important in the mind of Congress, for purposes of the immigration law? \" one would suppose that the most obvious touchstone of importance is the way Federal law deals with it... i.e., in the case of a crime, whether Federal law calls it a felony or Federal law calls it a misdemeanor.

Now, in your definition, we first look to see whether simple possession is punishable under the... in Controlled Substances Act. It sure is. It's punishable as a misdemeanor. So, it meets that. Under your definition, is it a felony? Yup, it's a felony in South Dakota. Okay. So, now we've got a prosecution, in Federal Court in South Dakota.

      "William H. Rehnquist: So that on these same facts if the Government had just said different words the outcome would have been different?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: Okay. What more do they have... is it enough to just say we have a hunch... supposing they say we have a hunch? We can't prove it in any way, we just have a hunch.\n",

Roberts, Jr.: If -- if we issue an opinion and we analyze the statute's language, the statute's purpose, and the statute's legislative history, would the opinion, the judgment be based on each of those or -- or not? In other words, does everything that goes into the final determination, would you say that determination is based on each of those factors individually?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: --I think my question goes in a different direction. This plea agreement, I think, could be said to be based on the sentencing guidelines, but it is also based on the agreement. In other words, the combination of the two of them is what gives you the -- the sentence. So how can you say it's based on only the sentencing guidelines when it may not have been imposed in the absence of the plea agreement? Probably wouldn't have been.\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: You quote one definition of -- the noun \"base\" in your brief uses a point from which something can develop, but you omit another standard definition of the term, the principal element or -- or ingredient of anything, considered as its fundamental part. Why do you do that?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Isn't it enough for you to say -- or based not in whole, but in part -- based on, something could be based on several things, and one of them is the guidelines that then existed?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, then are you saying the plea agreement was based on the fact that he was caught with -- with two guns rather than four guns? Would you be willing to say that? In other words, everything -- your position, it seems to me, could be criticized for saying everything that contributes to the final 106 months, that that sentence is based on every one of those things--\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, it's also based on things that are not reflected in the guidelines. You've got a particular U.S. attorney who is more lenient in prosecuting these types of crimes than another one. The fact that you got the minimum under the guidelines might be based on that. It's based on the fact that this person felt he could handle 106 months in prison, and he wasn't willing to risk whatever the top -- what was the top sentence under the guideline calculation?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: What sentence would he have gotten if he were just sentenced under the guidelines, no plea agreement?\n",

      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: So how can you say that this is based on the guideline range when the guideline range would not have been determinative?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: Counsel, could you -- maybe it would be easier if you would describe to us the situations you don't think would be based on the guidelines. The Solicitor General claims that since every plea negotiation has to start with the guideline calculation as a starting point for departure and/or consideration by the judge under 6B1, that every C plea agreement would be considered based on. Are you taking that position?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: All right. So I'll give you a couple of examples, but you give me more. Would a plea agreement that doesn't mention the guidelines at all but picks a sentence within the actual guideline -- is that based on the guideline?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: All right. And how about one that departs or varies from the guideline, the range, whichever word you want to use?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: So there -- the Solicitor General is right; there really isn't any situation that you're claiming is not based on?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, wouldn't the guidelines, even in that situation, provide the starting point for analysis? Isn't the district court obligated, and isn't the -- doesn't the presentence report have to go through the guidelines calculation before the sentence is imposed? So you start out with the -- the guideline sentence of whatever the figure was that you mentioned, and then you go from there, and maybe you depart downward.\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: So why wouldn't that be based on the guidelines? Just because there's such a big downward departure?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Sorry, I don't understand that. Don't the guidelines provide for departures?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Well -- and aren't you giving a guideline sentence, if you give your reasons as is required by the Sentencing Commission in 6B1.2 and you say -- the judge says, I think this is a special case and, therefore, I am giving a lower sentence? Just as he's required to do under the guidelines in order to accept a C type agreement.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Well, how could it not be? Wouldn't the judge have to say it's not tied to the guidelines, because I am varying and I no longer wish to apply the guideline? If he doesn't say that, isn't he applying the guideline?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Whether he gives the specific robbery 3-point whatever it is, 17 months, or whether he says, I have a special case and I depart under section 5 of the guidelines. Both of those are guideline sentences, aren't they?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: So from what base does a judge depart downward? From the crack cocaine range or from the downward departure range?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: So aren't you just asking us to permit district court judges to make up their own C agreement, to decide what the parties would have done in the absence of a higher range? And don't we fall prey to sort of just asking district court judges to create their own agreements?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: Mr. Heft, would you require those kinds of statements in the agreement or in the colloquy in order to satisfy the standard? Suppose those statements just didn't exist.\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, in every case, they have to go through the guidelines calculation, and the parties have the opportunity to object to the calculation, right?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: So what does paragraph 12 of the plea agreement contribute here, other than with respect to the fine and things besides the sentence that we're talking about? It doesn't seem to me to add anything substantively.\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Can a -- can a sentencing judge be found to have abused his or her discretion in approving a plea -- a C plea agreement which provides for less than the minimum guideline sentence and gives no -- no particular reason for that? Would that be appealed as an invalid sentence?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But now you're talking about a plea agreement, which the government has consented to whatever this agreement is and whether -- whether -- sometimes a plea agreement will say okay, if you take a plea, we'll drop certain charges or we'll charge a small amount -- value of the drug. Was there any of that in -- in this plea?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: --Let -- let me ask my question a different way. In deciding whether to approve the plea agreement, doesn't the judge have to consider whether it is an application of the guidelines, whether it is wildly inconsistent with the guidelines, whether it does not take into account valid reasons for departure from the guidelines?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: I don't understand why you resist that. I mean, that's precisely what the guidelines say. The only ones that aren't guideline sentences are -- are dismissal charges, where it's an agreement to dismiss. But a type B, type C -- the guidelines themselves say that the judge, here's what you do. Judge, you look and see if the guidelines sentence is there. Is it a guideline sentence? If it is, you can approve it. If it isn't, you can't. I mean, that's my reading of what it says. So -- so why do you resist that conclusion?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: And, of course, the judge now could depart from the guidelines -- I mean, \"vary\", whatever that word -- technical word, is -- \"vary\". He can say, I'm not going to apply the guidelines at all. But if he is going to apply the guidelines, isn't that what they tell him to do? I've always thought that. You may tell me I'm mistaken.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: --to accept any agreement other than agreement that corresponds with the guideline? That's what it says. It says the court should accept a recommended sentence or a C -- the specific sentence -- only if the court is satisfied either that it is within the applicable guideline range or if it's based on a departure under the guidelines. That seems to me what it says. Isn't that what it says?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Okay. Then if that's so, every sentence is -- you're going to say no?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Are we supposed to psychoanalyze the judge? The judge says on his writing, checks the box: This is a guideline sentence. It is robbery. It is precisely within the robbery range. But I -- I am going to give it the low end of the range because I believe that the -- he has a lovely mother and family and so forth. Okay? You're saying that isn't based on the guideline. No? Okay. Is that the point?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: What he does is he applies the guideline sentence. He has to do that. Now, within that range, he has applied the guideline sentence, he got the information. He says, I am satisfied it applies -- done. Now are we supposed to look further and say what his true reason is? Is that what you're saying?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Incidentally, and it sort of bears upon this discussion, are the guidelines mandatory when they are applied in approving a plea agreement? In other words, does Booker/Fanfan not apply to the application of the guidelines when a judge is -- is approving a plea agreement? Do you think the guidelines are mandatory in that situation?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: You were -- you were just at the very point when we decided Booker, is that right? It was -- your -- your sentencing took place in July 2005 and we came out with Booker in--\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: What if there had been evidence here of that? What if the government in connection with this plea agreement had dropped counts or had decided not to seek a superseding indictment adding counts? Would -- would the situation be the same?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: How would that possibly work? Let's say the government drops count -- agrees to a plea on count 1 with a guideline range of 60 to 65 months; drops count 2, which would have increased the guideline range to, let's say, 100 to 105 months; and says this is our deal, you know, you agree to -- to 65 months and we're going to drop count 2. All right?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: And then the guideline for that is lowered, and you say in determining whether the defendant is eligible, what -- the government would then have to have a mini-trial and prove that the -- prove count 2?\n",
      "\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: In your position, in your view, would the government be able to take the position that the guilty pleas stay in place, but it now wants maximum?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: So you say the judgment's final, so the fact that the plea -- that there's a breach of the plea agreement is irrelevant at this point?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: So you -- you acknowledge that \"based on\" covers post-Booker/Fanfan sentences by the judge?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Yes. MR. GANNON -- a specific sentence rendered under type C that -- on page 28 of our brief, we acknowledge that in most contexts, it's -- it's open to -- to contend that the sentence was based on the relevant guidelines-- --Even though -- even though the guidelines are just one of the things that have to be taken into account?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: So that's not your test. What is your test instead?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: Yes, but is -- is there some other instances in which you would say that something is based on, even though it's not of binding legal consequence?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Why doesn't this line of questioning lead logically to the conclusion that no sentence after Booker and Fanfan is based on the guidelines? Because, today, a sentencing judge can engage in the same analysis that the Sentencing Commission may engage in when it decides that a guideline range should be lowered and that that should be retroactive. The judge can do that at the time when the sentence is imposed. We roll the clock back on the crack -- on the crack cocaine guidelines. Under the authority that judges now have under Booker and Fanfan, a judge could say, well, I see that this is the crack cocaine guideline right now, but I think it is too harsh for all the reasons that were later persuasive in lowering the range, and therefore, I am sentencing below the range. So it seems to lead logically to the conclusion that 3582 is yet another provision of the Sentencing Reform Act that was tied to the old pre-Booker mandatory sentencing regime, and now that that is out the window with Booker and Fanfan, the whole -- the whole mechanism is -- is superfluous.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: All right. You want us to decide this case. I completely agree with what Justice Alito is saying, Justice Scalia, that maybe the world after Booker is different. And I have not thought that one through. I am thinking this case is a pre-Booker case. It is not real. I am thinking it is on the cusp, so how am I to treat this case? If it is a case where the guidelines apply, if it is such a case -- and I think maybe everyone here has assumed throughout that it was. Am I right about that? Were you saying this is a case where the guidelines do not apply, where they are not binding? I mean, where pre-Booker doesn't count?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: How do you want us to take this, pre-Booker or post-Booker?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: --All right. So you want to -- you want to set aside this post-Booker?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: I mean, imagine that the that the Sentencing Commission -- imagine. It is not true, but imagine that the Sentencing Commission had written the following words: \"Plea bargaining over sentences is above. \" as many argued they should. They write those words. Then they write the next word, \"exception\". There is an exception, however; you are permitted to plea bargain about a sentence insofar as you argue about the range, where, within the range, it applies. And of course when you apply the guidelines, as when you always apply the guidelines, here or elsewhere, departure is an unusual case. Now, suppose those were the words that the Commission had written. Could -- how -- is it possible under those circumstances you would still be arguing this sentence under the -- plea bargaining abolished except over where within the range -- is it possible you would be arguing that this is not based on the guidelines?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: --because it says in the sentencing guidelines, Judge, you will apply the guideline, unless you find a circumstance the Commission did not adequately take into account and in respect to that, you may and must consult policy statements, but guidelines and other materials. That is what it says. Okay? So take I am right on that. Assume I am right. You can disagree with me, and I will look into it.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Yes, that's right. That's what they wanted to do. Okay? Now, that is correct. But you can still have them.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: You could still have them, but they allow them only for the purpose of where within the range the sentence will lie. Okay?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Correct. Now I would like -- because if they wrote those words, C agreements are abolished, but for where within the range -- okay? You agree it would be based on the guidelines. Now what I'd like you to do is to look at section 6B, whatever that is.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: I am? I'm reading 6B1.3, I am reading commentary on the policy statement.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: And then that is what it intended to do and that is what it said it did, but for what we are talking about. Now, you first raised the question of did they have the authority to do that and I agree with you that that is a legitimate question. I made you assume it away, but I think it is a legitimate question. Now we have the additional question of how Booker/Fanfan changes that and for what and when. Do you see why I am puzzled and why I was asking you rather harshly to start with my hypothetical?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: --I don't -- I am not in disagreement with the point you're making, but I think that going back to what had bothered Justice Alito and Justice Scalia on now that the guidelines are not mandatory, is any sentence even under C really based on the agreement? Because even a C agreement has to be approved by the judge. The legal consequence is not the agreement. That doesn't sentence the defendant. It is the judge's decision as to what the sentence should be which he denotes in accepting the agreement that binds. And I think -- I may be making Justice Breyer's argument -- that if under the policy statement and it's clear what the judge did here, if the judge feels bound by the agreement or otherwise to calculate a sentence in the guidelines and impose one in the guidelines, how can you say that the legal effect is not the guideline sentence?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: I am not following that argument for this reason. It seems to me if you ask what did the judge apply at the time he imposed the original sentence, well, it has got to be the guidelines, because first the agreement provides for it; then he says I am going to wait for the probation report so I can see what the calculation is, whether I agree with it; and then he gives him a sentence that is precisely within the guidelines. So if you asked me to describe what that sentence was -- of what was it, 46 to 106 days -- I say that was a guideline sentence. It was right there within the brackets that -- the guidelines. So why wasn't it a guideline sentence?\n",

      "Stephen G. Breyer: To be specific, you live in California. You have a hot dog stand in Hawaii. All right? It has a $1,000 income. It comes back to California. You pay 13-1/2 California tax. Hawaii wants to charge another 12. So you're paying 25 percent. Can California say: That's fine; we give them no credit for the 11 percent they're paying in Hawaii? So the bottom check that you get is $750, not a 1,000. But if your hot dog stand were in California, the check would not be 750, it would be approximately 900. Okay? Now, is that constitutional or not?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: What is your best case that you can rely on for your answer to Justice Breyer? What's the best case you can cite. Complete Auto? I don't think that works for you.\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: No, I wouldn't if I were you trying to justify the answer either. What would you cite? What would your best cite be.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Here in my hypothetical the basis is identical. It's called an income tax, okay? And they run it in both States the same, and the problem that I would like you specifically and you are addressing with Justice Kennedy is what California says, open your hot dog stands in California. You go and open them in every other State and any other State, but particularly Hawaii, you will pay $125 more in income tax, not some flat other thing, not property tax, not some other kind of tax, in income tax. Okay. Now, that's constitutional because?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: The question is not whether California can tax the income of its residents wherever they make it or whether California can tax all income earned within the border of California. The question is whether it can do both, whether -- and that's the question with respect to you. Can you tax all income earned within your border, whether by resident or by nonresident, and also tax income earned by your residents in -- in other States? The tax economists' brief points out that this -- what you've done operates exactly like a tariff, because it provides an incentive to earn income in Maryland and not outside of Maryland. Now, do you dispute that as a factual matter? And if you don't dispute it as a factual matter, why shouldn't this tax system meet exactly the same fate as a tariff?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: That's my problem, is I don't I understand why it is that California has to yield in this California-Hawaii situation. Why is it that the State that taxes all the income of its residents has to yield rather than the State that taxes all income earned in the State? Why can't you just as well say, you know, Hawaii shouldn't be able to sock on an addition?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Your position your position is that the residents the domicile can tax worldwide income, period. And I think everybody agrees with that. The question is: Does the domicile have to give a credit because somebody else is also taxing it? Do you stop having the power to tax worldwide income because other States may tax on a different basis?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: That's not the Commerce Clause test, though. The cases where we've applied that test, has that have -- they been decided under the Commerce Clause?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: What about we're dealing with an individual because it's a Chapter S corporation, but what about a corporation that is domiciled in Maryland? I think Maryland, like all states, uses an apportionment formula for both domestic and foreign corporations.\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: Can we go back to the Chief's initial question. If we applied Complete Auto, would you fail the internal consistency test? And if you fail it, why shouldn't we apply that test here? Would you -- if we applied it, would you fail it?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: I must say I am confused about what this case involved. You argue, and I find it surprising, that it involves both the Commerce Clause and any other constitutional prohibition. Okay? Whereas your opponents, the question they say is presented is whether a state tax that exposes interstate commerce to double taxation is saved from invalidation under the Commerce Clause, merely because the state 2 why do you want to take on the whole Constitution when they only want to argue about the Commerce Clause?\n",

Adams, Gwin White & Prince, Hennerford, Central Greyhound of New York, all said that corporations, when they are taxed on their income by a state, that they have to apportion in a fair manner. Is that right?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: When you say it seems a little bit of hairsplitting. You say it's a test on residency, but not income. But we have previously said a tax on sleeping, measured by the number of pairs of shoes you have in your closet, is a tax on shoes. So you can call it residency, but if it's still using income as its basis as opposed to property values or whatever else these residency taxes are based on, then why isn't it a tax on income?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, just to understand what you said a minute ago, are you saying that if this same claim were brought by a nonresident challenging the nonresident tax in Maryland that would succeed?\n",

It's going to be subject to special use taxes. It's going to be subject to taxes that they have for one time to finance the schools. It's going to be subject to da, da, da, da, da. Okay? And so what they are really saying is, well, nobody claims that California can't do that and Maryland can ignore it for purposes of their income tax. It's tough to do business in California, according to some. Not to Californians. But nonetheless, this is just one more burden that you have to suffer and that's because they're on -- you heard the argument. So what's your response to that.\n",

      "Anthony M. Kennedy: In Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, 100 percent of the income is earned from out of State, and has five kids go to school, and they use all of the local facilities. Can Maryland impose any tax based on residence?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Can you give me the right numbers in what you said? We've heard different ones. You just said how many States provide a credit such that a resident has to pay the higher of the foreign State's tax on its business there, or the State's tax on income. You said 40 States impose some kind of credit like that, roughly?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: So every other State. How many are the every other State?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: 42 States. How many States are in the position of Maryland where they don't impose a credit -- or they do not grant a credit for some or all of the income?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: Well, don't some States allow localities to impose taxes that do not give a credit? So, for example, the New York City income tax would be the classic example of that.\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: --But you recognize that there are jurisdictions, local jurisdictions, that impose a tax and don't give a credit?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: Mr. Perella, you're not saying that we have to or that we should establish a priority rule as to different taxing schemes, do -- are you? You're not saying it has to be source-based over residence-based, or -- or vice versa?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: Well, let me ask you: I mean, suppose we were to say what Maryland is doing is not okay, but then States could choose. Some would do a source-based tax, some would do a residency-based tax. And if you had a situation like that, it seems it could lead to double taxation in exactly this kind of way. If you were living in the wrong State and all of a sudden the combination of one State having a pure source-based and one State having a pure residency-based tax was going to lead to double taxation. Why is that any different?\n",

      "Elena Kagan: Mr. Perella, we said in this American Trucking case, we said we were going to allow States to impose a neutral, local tax even though it violated internal consistency. Why shouldn't we see this as pretty equivalent to American Trucking? In other words, a State saying, we're going to impose a small tax to ensure that you are paying for some of the very basic services that we provide.\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Why should that give me comfort? [Laughter] What difference does that make?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: What if they didn't do it on gross income, but just said every resident has to pay X amount?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: But why doesn't Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, isn't it exactly the same as the American Trucking hypothetical? You just distinguished the flat tax versus the percentage income tax. I thought that that was your principal distinction of American Trucking.\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: But, you know, there -- there's an inequity either way. The inequity on the other side is you have two neighbors side by side. Their kids both use the school. One of the neighbors makes most of his income out of the State and you want to say that would not be taxable, whereas the other neighbor makes all of the income in the State and pays a very high, very high tax.

And then he said: There is no other Federal question in the case; I do not reach the question that you are raising, that is, life without parole being cruel and unusual. All -- the only Federal question that, under our rules, I reach is, does Roper cover this case? No. Anything else is procedurally barred. What was wrong with that?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: Well, suppose arguendo we assume that the judge is right, that Roper did not establish a rule that applies in this case. Then what position are you in with reference to the procedural bar? Do you have any other arguments that overcome the procedural bar?\n",

      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: No, but I'm -- I'm interested in how we decide whether it's independent. If you had cited -- if you said Marbury v. Madison dictates this result, well, the judge would have to decide what Marbury v. Madison required. That's a Federal -- that can be characterized as a Federal question. That would make the -- that would make it -- the State law ground not an independent ground?\n",

Now, let's suppose that we take those out of it; in other words, for argument's purpose, concede that where there is also a homicide offense, it counts as homicide, not in the set I am asking you about.

There are three exceptions to that. One and three clearly don't apply. And as to two, Roper isn't clear enough to make it apply. Their response to that is there is no Florida law that says you have to challenge a sentence within 2 years. That Florida courts -- and then they have, like, 14 cases listed here. And the Supreme Court of Florida has said that when you are trying to correct an illegal sentence, that whole part of the statute does not apply. Okay? What's the response to that?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Okay. So what I should do is go look up and see what those cases hold, and -- and you said to the lower court or the court of appeals -- you said their argument is wrong. The 2-year statute does apply. There are three exceptions, and you do not fit within section (B) because. Where did you say that?\n",

If we were to say in our opinion -- if we were to say that Roper does hold that there is a fundamental constitutional right which we extend to this case and it applies here, and it applies to the -- retroactively to those whose -- certainly those who are raising the issue, then we would send it back and Florida now would not bar it under this statute, because it would fall squarely within the exception.

      "William H. Rehnquist: Mr. Chief Justice Burger and may it please the court. My name is Joseph Bauer, counsel for petitioner, Phillip Jerome Lee. This case involves issues under the Due Process Clause and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In Illinois v. Somerville, this Court observed that virtually all double jeopardy cases turn on the particular facts. Therefore, I would like to begin this morning with a brief statement of the facts, because that is essential for an understanding of the issues presented in this case. In December 1973, a theft allegedly occurred in the United States’ Post Office. A few weeks later in 1974, a federal information was filed charging the petitioner with that theft. Petitioner waived his right to trial by jury. On the day of the trial and prior to the introduction of any evidence, counsel for petitioner moved to dismiss the information because it failed to allege a vital portion of that information, that is that theft requires that the act be committed knowingly and with an intent to deprive the owner of the use of the property. He had an opportunity to make such a motion earlier in the proceedings, did he not?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: What was going on? Wasn't jury selection about to begin?\n",

      "Harry A. Blackmun: First of all, could not he make the objection before the opening statement on the part of counsel?\n",
      "Harry A. Blackmun: So, what is your position that jeopardy have not attached?\n",
      "Thurgood Marshall: You said that the judge could have gone out and looked at the case right quick, he did not suggest that to the judge, did he?\n",
      "Thurgood Marshall: He did not object at all? The judge says, I will pass on when I get time to look at that and counsel remains silent.\n",
      "Thurgood Marshall: You mean he did not understand what the judge said?\n",
      "Thurgood Marshall: How can a judge raise at a guy who will understand what he says other than to say it?\n",
      "Thurgood Marshall: Well, the record is correct that the judge said specifically, I will pass on this when I get time to look at that?\n",
      "Thurgood Marshall: Did he read the -- did he read anything from the case?\n",
      "Thurgood Marshall: But why did not he read it? He said was so clear, why did not he say it? The bottom line and opinion says quote unquote that will give the judge a little something, wouldn't it?\n",
      "Thurgood Marshall: Well, what could the government have done at that stage?\n",
      "Thurgood Marshall: Would you go so far as if he said I think the indictment is insufficient?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: Did the government have any advance notice that this motion would be made?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: Well then prosecution counsel was hardly in a better position to have this -- take one of these alternatives that you have suggested and of course have to decide this issue suddenly presented, is that not so?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: We can accept that without any difficulty, but you are suggesting that this was so clear that everyone should have been able to react right away. If it were so clear then why in seven week’s time since counsel had been appointed had he not made his motion before trial so as to give the government and the court reasonable opportunity to analyze the issue?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: Do you think the defendant’s counsel in Court at that time as an officer of the Court as he is, as you are, had an obligation to suggest to the Court the possibility that delay in acting on that while he proceeded to take testimony might create some serious problems in the administration of justice? I think had he recognized the full double jeopardy implications at that time perhaps he might. Trial counsel was a young, inexperienced man, had been admitted to the bar for less than a year, again that does not excuse him. But in the circumstances of this case, having been appointed as the second counsel to petitioner, one of the things that might naturally have happened upon his appointment under the Criminal Justice Act, was that he would have initially commenced doing research on the facts of the case, interview defendant, interview potential witnesses, and although it is clearly not the best trial strategy, it might well be a reasonable thing not to look at the language, the text of the information immediately perhaps not even look at the information until the day of trial. I am not suggesting that that is the best strategy but I am suggesting that that was a reasonable course in the circumstances here.\n",
      "Thurgood Marshall: You mean that when a lawyer defends a case lastly, he does not read the information?\n",

      "John Paul Stevens: Mr. Bauer, would your case be different if Judge Ashba (ph) had made findings effect of guilt and then dismiss the indictment after that? Or have waited for a post verdict ruling?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Well, let us take to double jeopardy for the moment. If you say that there could have been a retrial, I suppose you also then would acknowledge that if there had been a post trial dismissal on this ground; it could have been appealed by the government?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: In other words, say Judge Ashba (ph) had post-verdict, had dismissed that preceding. The government had appealed saying the areas are not that clear at all. We think that the indictment was sufficient and then the Court of Appeals had affirmed the dismissal. The government could still re-indict, wouldn't it?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Well, but that rest entirely on the error being so plain. Lots of times, a motion like this can raise a rather complicated question that the judge either has to adjourn the trial or go ahead subject to ruling later. Would you have a ruling that when every such a motion is made as trial commences, the judge has an absolute duty to postpone the taking of evidence that they can rule on it?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Well, it is easy to say that after the fact, but the trial judges who have to go ahead with trials you know, it is not that easy. I do not think any motion is that easy?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: What was so egregious, why did it take defense counsel seven weeks before he noticed it?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: It is only a coincidence that this was a bench trial. Suppose the jury had been impaneled and sworn and then this motion had been made, what would the situation be then?\n",

      "Lewis F. Powell, Jr.: Mr. Bauer, may I ask you again, how can one be sure that this was not a deliberate bypass when counsel for defendant made no objection to the procedure that judge followed. The judge made it very clear you needed to look up the law. Counsel was present and he remained silent. If you have been the judge, would not you have felt that you had the questions of counsel and proceeding with the trial?\n",
      "Thurgood Marshall: Mr. Bauer, why do you consistently say he needed a recess? There was no jury. They did not need a recess. They could have argued it right there.\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Well, I suppose one reason defense counsel might not have pursued it too vigorously was that he would not gain very much if he would be gotten any indictment amended right there in the spot, what does he gain?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Well, that under your view of the law, that is true anyway?\n",

      "Thurgood Marshall: So if they had been amended, then your man would be in jail? Good.\n",

      "Byron R. White: But in my example, the matter the Court operates on or regresses itself to after verdict is something that the defendant instituted before evidence had been taken. And he never renews it, never pushes it, and the judges delays acting on it until after the verdict. Now what difference is that case -- what is the difference between that case and this one?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: I think your brother on the other side would say that the difference might be in the interest that has been emphasized in some of our double jeopardy decisions. The interest in the defendant of having the first trial effect, reach a conclusion, reach a verdict, where is that difference?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: Well, an arrest of judgment should be tried on an indictment with a different allegation, would you not just the same way you would be on an appeal?\n",
      "Harry A. Blackmun: Are you suggesting there is another ground for there being no double jeopardy, here namely he is being tried for a different crime?\n",

He can have to deal with the two things separately.\n",
      "Potter Stewart: So you are not really relying on the point you just made?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Mr. Frey, can I interrupt you right there? Why is not that same argument applicable to Jenkins because there the defendant did not object to the dismissal or discharge at the time the judge made it without all the necessary findings had been made?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: But that is the issue was whether it was because the Court held as I read the Court’s opinion that the reason it was not appealable was there were some more factual determinations necessary and why is not that just exactly like this?\n",

      "Byron R. White: And you would apply this rule even though he initially had not asked for it himself?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Well, suppose the trial judge on his own motion for some reason that the defendant has not focused on dismisses the indictment during trial and the defendant does not object?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Mr. Frey can I ask one other question? The fatal defect one of the critical point is the defendant did not object to the pre-verdict termination. Now, in stating that, are you emphasizing the fact that he made the motion or are you emphasizing the fact that the time the judge rule, after all the evidence was in he did not in effect say please do not grant my motion?\n",

There is lack of adequate protection unless you are assured, unless the stay is modified to give you the time value of the money. If that is the case, then why isn't (d)(2) entirely superfluous? That is, with respect to a stay of an act against property under Subsection (a), you can move for modification if two conditions. Number one, the debtor does not have an equity in such property... but that is always going to be the case when you have an undersecured creditor... and, two, you need a second condition under (d)(2)... such property is not necessary for an effective reorganization. You wouldn't need that second condition under your theory of the case, because the first condition, the first part of (d)(2) would be the same as (d)(1), and you wouldn't need a second part to (d)(2).\n",

Am I doing injustice to your argument?\n",

You've been -- you've have been laboring order, at least you took it to get this result and therefore, you're welcome to say that -- that you aren't really before the Court and you really were, but merely by sitting in and conducting a litigation, you don't make yourself a party.

If we assume for a moment that it really does not matter whether the man is indictment on all charges and some are dismissed or he is just indicted on some later, the others are added on if he does not enter into a plea, is there not nevertheless perhaps a different problem that this case indicates and that is this. If there is a gross disparity between the charge that the prosecutor is willing to abandon whether in advance of negotiation or later and the lesser charge that he really wants to get a conviction on, is there not some risk that a quite remote danger of conviction on a charge that might bring life imprisonment or death or something like that, for the prosecutor to give up that possible result in exchange for a 30-day sentence, would it not inherently make you wonder whether there was not sufficient in terrorem effect that an innocent man might plead guilty to the lighter charge? Is it not that the problem as the comparison between what one side is going to give up in exchange for what it gets does on the timing of it?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: I agree. That does not go to the question that you have been arguing as to whether the one has to come ahead of the other in terms of the procedure. Is there not a potential for prosecutorial abuse in the kind of situation I described and then to go further, what were the alternatives in this case? One was life sentence as opposed to, what, five years?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: I understand your argument about that. But you did seem to suggest there are limits to what the prosecutor might do and I am really asking you whether one of those limits is not having charges that are so disparate that an innocent man might be tempted to plead guilty to a very minor charge in order to avoid risk of conviction of a very major charge. Is that a possible limit? If not, what limits are there?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: In answer to Mr. Justice Marshall, I understood you to say it does not matter whether the charges are related or unrelated. That is not the touchdown. You can follow the same procedure here with totally unrelated events?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: What, if any, is the limit on their discretion which should guide the prosecutor in this kind of negotiation. Should we not be concerned about the risk that an innocent man may be induced to plead guilty to a minor charge in this kind of negotiation? Is that not what we really are concerned about?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: But is there any limit to the discretion that you are saying?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: I understand that you do not offer any alternatives?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: I understand that you do not suggest any limit either. You just acknowledge there is some limit somewhere but you have no idea of how to identify?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: You never had a limit based on the disparity between the charge that he is asked to plead to and the charge you will have to go to trial if he does not plead?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: So far in the cases in this Court, rather than limits the Court has been concerned with assuring that the bargain is kept, is that not correct?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: Yes and the Court, while it may have and probably has talked about the fact that there are some limits, it has not in any way tried to define the meets and bounds of those limits, rather it has been concerned with assuring that the promise be kept, is that not correct?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: I suppose if there is actual coercion, then it is not bargaining anymore. That is, if there is brutality, compelling a person to plead guilty or trickery or deception, then it is not longer bargaining. We had a pro curium not so long ago involving that kind of a situation?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: But if it is fair bargaining, the Court so far has not defined any limits?\n",

Rehnquist: Mr. Chenoweth, is it not one of the consequences of a habitual offender statute the fact that the crime which finally brings the person within the terms of, say a four-time offender statute itself may carry a fairly light sentence, whereas the habitual offender statute simply by virtue of the number of crimes may carry a very severe sentence?\n",
      "Byron R. White: I suppose that any plea of guilty is subject to collateral attack or a direct appeal on the grounds that it was not voluntary and I suppose another limit is that the defendant should have the adequate counsel?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Is there a claim in this case, as a matter of fact, the plea was coerced?\n",
      "Byron R. White: I know, but it is just a conclusion. The real point or the real argument is that there should be a per se rule that would might prevent some actual coercion?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Tell me again, perhaps you have already -- tell me again why a prosecutor would not say “bring the habitual criminal charge in the first instance?”\n",
      "Byron R. White: Well substantively the habitual criminal statute represents rather serious judgment I suppose as to what should happen to a person and if the Court of Appeals thought that if the prosecutor thinks society’s interest demands prosecution for the more serious offense, they ought to put it on the indictment?\n",
      "\n",
      "Potter Stewart: That is true if it serves to flaw the trial or appellant process?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: North Carolina against Pearce held that vindictiveness or the threat of vindictiveness would impair the absolute right that was accorded by the state to appeal or to collaterally attack a conviction and thereby impaired and impeded and flawed the appellate process or the collateral attack process. Here, your adversary tells us that there is no flawing of any right that is given?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: If that is the case, what you describe always what the upshot of what happens when a plea bargaining is unsuccessful, always. Then, after, if plea bargaining comes to an impasse, then the defendant pleads not guilty and he goes to trial under the risk of a conviction of a greater offense or of a longer sentence than he would have achieved in the plea bargain. That is the whole nature of the beast, is it not?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: Well, that is when a bargain is reached, but when a bargain is not reached, what you describe is always the result. If the defendant pleads not guilty and he gets to trial under the risk of getting worst and longer sentence in a more serious conviction than he would have plead guilty to if the bargain had been negotiated. That is always the result, is it not?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: He was told in the process of the bargaining, what the result would be?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: And did the prosecutor not further say if you do not plead guilty, what is going to happen?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: Well, if we uphold the Sixth Circuit here, every prosecutor faced with the situation as this one, this is going to indict for both the latest substantive offense and a habitual offense and the defendants are not going to be better off?\n",
      "Harry A. Blackmun: This is also my question. Are you not in effect, if you prevail, forcing precautionary overcharging, to use the phrase, one that you use in your briefs, and therefore, if you prevail are you not actually winning nothing or in other words, does the case not amount to very little?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: But here, just a minute. The habitual offender charge here certainly could not be rationally found to be overcharging?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: I am sure he can. Why should a constitutional principle turn on whether he chooses to indict on both offenses first and then give up the bigger one at the conclusion of a plea bargain or indict only on the substantive offense first and then if the plea bargain fails, indict on the larger one?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Do you think your client knew what he faced under the law from his attorney?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Some of our cases say that certainly the adequacy of counsel issue survives pleas of guilty. Are you suggesting that the counsel was inadequate in this case?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Do you think there was adequate counsel in this case here?\n",
      "Byron R. White: If counsel is adequate, he can advise his client what kind of penalties he faces for his conduct. He probably knows more about it or he should know more about it than the prosecutor. He probably knows more about what the defendant did than the prosecutor?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: Could I ask you if in Kentucky that plea bargaining goes on prior to indictment?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: I would suppose that if in those places where it does, if we we affirm the Sixth Circuit, no one could afford a plea bargain until after the grand jury met and the indictments came down?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: Well, now that is important, Mr. Aprile. It seems to me it may be a subtle difference, but it strikes me that it might be a dispositive one. You have stated this case so far as though there were plea bargaining within the original charge, as indeed there was, but that that was the extent of the plea bargaining on the count of uttering the forged check and offered by the prosecutor to recommend a five-year sentence. After that plea bargaining failed then, without any further opportunity for the defendant, the prosecutor went on his own hook and got the grand jury to indict under the habitual criminal statute with no further opportunity for the defendant to bargain and thereby the prosecutor penalized the defendant’s constitutional right to plead not guilty. Now, that would be one case, it seems to me, but if, on the other hand, the other case would be if the chronology were that there was bargaining under the original charge and the defendant said “no, I think I might plead not guilty,” then the prosecutor said “Well, if you do that, I am going to go to the grand jury and get them to indict under the habitual criminal statute under which you can get five imprisonment.” Then, if there were an opportunity for additional bargaining that would be quite a different case, it seems to me. The difference may seem like a subtle one, but it might be because the second case is a different case from the one you have presented to us, it seems to me?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: But that is not what the Court of Appeals opinion says?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: It says that during this conference the prosecutor offered to recommend the five-year sentence if Hayes would plead guilty, petitioner was warned that if he did not plead guilty he will be charged under the habitual criminal statute?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: Does that imply that there was still an opportunity for the defendant to plead guilty and get a recommendation of the prosecutor of five years or was it too late? Was this a vindictive punishment to him for turning down the original bargain?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: And accept the bargain of a recommendation of a five-year sentence?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: My question is, factually, was there still an opportunity? Was that still a continuation of the bargaining or was it a punishment of the defendant for his failure to reach an agreement? Now, which was it?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: Up here we do not generally have a dispute of facts. We take the facts as they are and try to apply the law?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: That is a different case than the one you presented?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: What you just stated is always just describing plea bargaining generally?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Mr. Aprile, let me interrupt there. If we focus on actual vindictiveness as I guess is the standard you would suggest, what if you had this situation? That a prosecutor presents to the grand jury a charge of uttering an $88-forged check and a second count habitual criminal charge which bears a life sentence. At the time he does so, he has no intention whatsoever of going to trial on the second charge. He presents the charge to the grand jury solely for the purpose of having a bargaining ticket which he can use to coerce the defendant into pleading guilty to the $88-charge. Could one not call that actual vindictiveness?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: But could you not make a strong argument for the proposition that that would be actual vindictiveness?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: It is overcharging in the sense that the prosecutor has no interest whatsoever in getting a conviction on the second charge. He brings it purely for the purpose of enhancing his bargaining power on the $88-charge?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Well, the same interest is served in both cases. The purpose of the second count is simply to induce a guilty plea on the first count. I do not know why it can be right in one context and wrong in the other. It seems to me it is either wrong in both or wrong in neither?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Well, my case chills the constitutional right too. He has the same variables to work with because I do not think that -- say instead of being a habitual criminal, let us say it is murder. One is murder and the other one is an $88-check. Is that “I really do not think they can convict me of murder, but my gosh, if they do, it is pretty darn serious. I better plead guilty to the $88-charge, I do not take any chances.” Do you say that is different depending on whether he is indicted ahead of time or merely told in the plea bargain that this is a consequence that might ensue?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: I have made the assumption. It is always for the purpose of getting the plea of guilty to the lesser charge. That is why he does it, is it not?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: In both cases, the intention is if you will plead guilty to the lesser charge, we will not prosecute on the other. If he does not plead guilty, we will shoot the works and get him for whatever we can?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: So what you are saying is that any inducement automatically becomes virtually a threat and a vindictive action?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: No, I think misrepresentation is not the word. That is the way I take your argument?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: What it ends up to is that when inducements are offered, if they are rejected, they are converted into threats?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: Is that not true of every other plea bargain and it fails?\n",
      "Harry A. Blackmun: Then I come back to where I started. If you prevail, you are going to have every case with a full fledged indictment from here on in so that you gain really nothing. You have a phyrric victory in future cases?\n",
      "Harry A. Blackmun: Because every prosecutor is going to indict all of your defendants on a habitual criminal charge?\n",
      "Harry A. Blackmun: They are not only going to threaten, they are going to indict from here on in. That is the only way that they can protect themselves. What do you gain?\n",
      "Harry A. Blackmun: Therefore, why leave it as an initial indictment? Why not bring a broader one at the start? It takes your case completely out from under you.\n",
      "Thurgood Marshall: My brother Blackmun is not talking about a re-indictment, he is talking about original indictment?\n",
      "Thurgood Marshall: Let me put it separately. In this particular county where this man was convicted, do you have any doubt that the prosecutor in that one is going to over indict?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: Some states have abolished plea bargaining all together?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Would that still be here if the prosecutor says what he said here then gets the broader indictment after the defendant does not plead and then bargaining resumes?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Even though originally he had only a narrow indictment and he said “if you do not plead to his one I am going to get a broader one?”\n",
      "Byron R. White: Well, if this situation had resulted in a guilty plea, the claim of coercion would still have been open?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: In one district recently a study showed that there were great many cases where additional crimes were committed while the defendant was released on his own recognizance. Six different charges ultimately had accumulated by the time they came to trial on the first one. Would all that you have been saying apply equally to subsequent crimes committed repeatedly after the defendant was released on bail?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: He might have been able to get the indictments on the other charges before they reach the point of plea negotiations?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Could I ask you if you would have a different position if there had never been any bargaining confrontations between the prosecutor and the defendant? Simply, initially, there was an indictment. No plea of guilty was forthcoming. The prosecutor added a count. He broadened the indictment. No plea of guilty was forthcoming, and he kept broadening it. Then they went to trial. Would you be here then or not?\n",
      "Byron R. White: So the face-to-face confrontation and the oral threat as you call it, really is not determinative in the case?\n",

      "Harry A. Blackmun: Mr. Powers, I want to be sure. Kaiser is or is not admitting past discrimination?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Well, what I'm asking whether ultimately whether you concede that after the case, that you could not make out any defense but do you concede that the figures would make a prima facie case that would require you to come forward?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: Of course the Bakke case really has nothing to do with this one. The Bakke case was decided by majority of the Court under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment which is wholly inapplicable here, isn't it?\n",

Rehnquist: Mr. Powers, supposing that the quest -- the answers you've given to my Brother White's and Blackmun's questions previously were different, that there wasn't even any arguable showing that your company had discriminated in the past. Do you think that the program you instituted 1974 would be permissible under Title VII?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: But the Title VII isn't the Executive Order, is it?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: So you said that even though there -- nobody could have made out even a prima facie case of discrimination against your company in court, nonetheless this agreement was permissible under Title VII?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: You think to the extent that creates discriminate situations or discrimination. What's your position as to whether it does or does not create that situation?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: Well, the employers and union could do it, if Congress would let them do it, is that not so?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: Suppose for example Congress had a statute which I, I will try to draft the statute here but something to this effect that provided however, applying to all existing statutes that nothing in this statutes would prohibit an employer, unilaterally or by contract with the union from agreeing to carry out a program of the kind we have here, the preferential treatment to minorities who'd been denied equal opportunities in the past in order to remedy that. Now, there wouldn't be any state action in that, would there?\n",

      "Potter Stewart: Mr. Gottesman, I know that your ultimate position is that this simply is not a violation of Title VII of the 1964 Act but isn't it despite what you just told us, isn't it on its face -- prima facie a violation. It's an evident discrimination against white people, isn't it?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: So what you said, I assume in a lawsuit would be defensive, wouldn't it? And the plaintiff could certainly, be it Mr. Weber or any other life's similarly situated could bring a lawsuit.

Under the previous version of the statute, 18 U.S.C. 3651 in the 1982 version of Title eighteen [= 18] and also under I think previous versions of the probationary sentencing scheme, the court had an option. It could either impose a sentence and then excuse the execution of the sentence, which is the option you identified, or it could suspend sentencing... suspend the imposition of a sentence, assuming the defendant complied with the conditions of probation. And what was normally done, do you suppose? I mean, in times when I used to participate in sentencing the typical thing was to impose the sentence and then suspend it.\n",

      "William H. Rehnquist: Well, why the top of the range rather than the bottom of the range?\n",
      "Sandra Day O'Connor: Well, but original sentence could logically refer to the original sentence of probation, could it not? I mean--\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: --Smith, maybe you've been too generous here. I suppose your first answer to Justice O'Connor, were you not so generous, is that you don't mind interpreting this thing literally. If you interpret it literally, you end up with a probation term of one-third the original sentence, right?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: And so once we... and literally, that's clearly what it means, and once we depart from that, the issue is simply whether we take a... I mean, really, to call it a nonliteral interpretation doesn't really do justice to what a leap it is... we take a fanciful interpretation, should we take a fanciful interpretation that favors your client, or the fanciful interpretation that favors the Government? That's really the choice, because the only literal interpretation gives your client, as punishment, one-third of his original probation term.\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: Well, Mr.-- --Well, we have to answer it with some sort of reasoned opinion, not just kind of a... the least common denominator type of... what did the Eleventh Circuit say about... do you think it followed the statute literally?\n",

      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Mr. Smith, before you go on with that, do I understand you correctly to say that on your view, if there must be incarceration, then the top would be 6 months, and the minimum, not less than one-third, would be 2 months, is that your view?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: --Mr. Smith, if we adopt your interpretation, is it always the more lenient for the defendant, or does it just happen to be in the case of your client?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: I know... there's no situation in which using the Government's system would produce a lower sentence?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: May I ask you a question, going back to... looking at the time the statute was enacted, were there people in Federal prisons at that time who had been sentenced under the regime that Justice O'Connor described such as having gotten a sentence of 6 months... or a sentence of 6 months in jail suspended, and in lieu thereof probation for 5 years, for example?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: And under that view, what would you have interpreted the original sentence to refer to, the suspended term of imprisonment, or the probationary period?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But do you disagree with the Government that that would not have fit this statute because prior to this change probation was not considered a sentence of any kind?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: I suppose it wouldn't be strange to think that if Congress did have in mind the old system, and was referring to one-third of the original sentence that was suspended, I wonder, it was always my understanding that if you violated the terms of your probation, not just one-third of the sentence that was imposed would be given you, but in fact the whole term. Would it be normal to revoke probation, which was a grace from a sentence that was presumably a considered sentence? Revoke the probation, and then say, but we're not going to give you your original sentence, we're just going to give you one-third of it?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: What was the sentence in fact imposed in this case?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: This is subsequent legislative history we're talking about now, isn't it?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: On your reading, could the judge say, originally the guidelines gave me zero to 6 months, but I could have gone up to 5 years if I wrote an opinion saying why I was going outside the guidelines. Now I'm ready to do that. Would that be within the range on your interpretation? I asked you before... I think you said that the range would be 2 months minimum, 6 months maximum. Could the judge at this stage say, I'm going to go back to the sentencing authority I had originally, sentence him to the 5 years, and I'll write an opinion explaining why?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Mr. Smith, I think you've just given me an example in which the Government's interpretation would be more lenient to the defendant than yours. Wasn't that the point of your example?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: I thought your point was that you should be able, in the event of murder, to consider going higher, to consider going beyond the guidelines range, wasn't that your point?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: --know that individualized sentencing is best? I mean, Congress provided for a regime of individualized sentencing for a long time. It abandoned it in '84, and now has guidelines. How is a court to say that one is better than the other?\n",

Would the statute apply to that person?\n",

Would that give us a constant interpretation of this statute, depending upon what kind of a situation first comes before us, or rather, would we interpret the statute leniently to the first defendant and then also leniently to the second defendant, depending upon which interpretation works case by case?\n",

You won't allow for probation to get to a sentence of incarceration. You have to drop something on your interpretation, and on the other interpretation you take the only incarceration sentence that's possible, the sentence that was open to the judge originally. I don't see why that's not an equally permissible interpretation.\n",

Maybe they are too low in the district court, but why should there be -- why should we, as a discretionary matter if we have the discretion, provide for radically different fees depending on the court in which the case originates?\n",

We don't care if they did a lot of work or a little work. We want them to be paid $40 a day, period. It's too much trouble to figure out how much work they did. That's what we want. That's the law. Now, Justice Alito said: I agree with you for argument's sake; we are not bound by that rule. But I take it his question, which I heard no answer to, is: Assume you are right; we are not bound by the law; still, why shouldn't we follow it?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Have you any example where Congress had a statute which says every court in the United States must pay da-da-da, whatever that number is; it's $382.50, okay. Now, despite that clear statute, this Court for exactly the same thing paid a different amount. Is there any such case?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Okay. Is there anything in the -- in the nature of litigation? And there might be. I'm not asking it as a rhetorical question. Is there anything in the nature of original jurisdiction lawsuits that, as a general matter, would call for higher fees to be paid for witnesses, or to make a distinction between expert witnesses and others, or to do other things that would complicate it? I'm not speaking of your case. You have a wonderfully strong case in your case. I want to know about in general, in original actions.\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Well, I assume -- I assume your answer is that -- that it's our business, and we don't have to agree with Congress; that we -- we may think $40 a day for the zookeeper and for Albert Einstein is ridiculous. And, therefore, if it's up to us, we would adopt a different rule. Isn't that your answer?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: --Well, I'm not sure that answer is -- is at all adequate. Number one, what is there, as Justice Breyer pointed out, that's so different about this case? Let's say one landowner secretly and intentionally is stealing another landowner's water, and -- and he has no legal right to do that. And the only way the injured landowner can recover is to hire a very, very expensive expert, a hydrologist. And by the time he goes to court, he is already going to lose the benefit of the damages. Congress has said too bad. That's the way it is. Why isn't it that way with States, especially, as Justice Breyer said, when States can really afford the -- afford it better than the landowner. What's the difference?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: I haven't seen -- I mean the $40 limitation makes absolutely no sense, does it? I mean I never saw an expert who would agree to spend the day appearing in court worth being called an $40. I mean the fact that -- I guess I'm just repeating Justice Scalia's question. The fact that Congress has picked an arbitrary number with no basis in reality doesn't mean that we should do the same.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: It's not unfair to have a rule which says each party pays his own experts, win or lose. That's the rule, isn't it?\n",

      "Stephen G. Breyer: Well, should we do that, too? If we are going to have them pay the experts, why don't we have them, the losing side, pay the lawyers' fees? That would be quite a revolution, but--\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Could it say that for the lower courts? I mean, you are -- you are trying to distinguish what it can say for the Supreme Court when the Supreme Court is the trial court vis-a-vis what it can say, and has said, for the lower courts.\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: You think that, so long as Congress could not create the lower courts at all, once it creates them it can -- it can tie their hands to any sort of absurd rules?\n",

      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, why -- why did the parties agree to it if we do it? In other words, if we say in our orders who bears the Special Master's fees, why -- why would the parties agree to it?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Isn't it -- isn't it customary for it to be divided 50/50? I mean, we periodically will approve the fees that the Special Master charges, and then they are divided between the parties. And I thought that they were divided 50/50. Is that not so?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: What is magical about original actions? I mean, what -- what is magical is that we are the only court that is required by the Constitution. But we are -- we are not just the only court for original actions in -- in -- in all appeals. Can Congress prescribe division of costs and expenses in the appeals that come to us from the lower Federal courts?\n",
      "\n",

      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Isn't this an area, though, where we should be particularly sensitive? In other words, one reason that we were given original jurisdiction in these cases is that the States were afraid of what Congress would do in its own courts, the courts it set up -- might set up under the Constitution. I think it would be surprising if you told the States at the framing that Congress gets to regulate this original jurisdiction where you, for example, can sue the Federal Government, that -- I think that would be surprising. It would not be regarded by them as a significant safeguard.\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: --General Suthers, do we know what has happened in past original jurisdiction cases? Maybe it hasn't come up because other Special Masters have said, we'll give the expert witness a reasonable fee for services commensurate with the qualifications and the work that the expert has done. We don't know if that has or hasn't happened in the past, do we?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Did you find any cases where the Special Master had appointed his own witness as distinguished from the parties?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But you -- but you recognize that if the Special Master appointed a witness, or the Court, that that witness would be paid a compensatory fee?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Now, in a -- in a case like this one, where the nature of the work that the expert did seemed to be very helpful to both sides, isn't it odd that if the Special Master chose the court expert, that expert would be compensated fairly, but if you have one party calls an expert who renders great service to the Court, to both sides, doesn't get compensated, isn't that an anomaly?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: --The question is whether one side can get some money from the other to help pay for it. Do you happen to know whether at the time the original jurisdiction of this Court was established, there was such a thing as the charging of expert witness fees?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Do you -- may I ask you a statutory question, just about the application of the statute? As -- as you have pointed out, if the $40 applies, it's because it is, in effect, a determination of a particular item under section 1920: Judge and clerk of any court of the United States may tax its cost. My question is this: One of the items covered by 1920, one of the items that a judge or clerk may tax, is fees of the clerk. Under section 1911, which relates entirely to the Supreme Court, there is a provision that the Supreme Court may fix the fees to be charged by its clerk. That is totally redundant if 1920 covers the Supreme Court of the United States. Doesn't it follow, therefore, that section 1920 was -- despite its reference to any court of the United States, doesn't it follow that that statute was not intended to apply to the Supreme Court? And doesn't it follow from that that either the Supreme Court's authority is to fix the fees if this is a fee to be charged by the clerk or, in the alternative, that there is no statute on it at all? But the main point is, unless 1911 is totally redundant in -- in referring to fixing the fees to be charged by its clerk, then 1920 must not cover the Supreme Court.\n",
      "David H. Souter: In other words, if it's redundancy, it proves too much, is what you're saying?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: --what number here? You don't think that 1911 would allow the clerk to charge for printing fees?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: It is -- I mean, if you want to really get a little complicated, the -- you have -- you have 11, and 11 talks about the Supreme Court fees. And then we have 20 and that talks about all the other fees, right? Okay. So the thing is, you can't pay money in the United States unless have you some authorization, but 1911 gives the Supreme Court some authorization to fix fees. Now, we look back at 1821. And 1821 tells you how much mileage per diem and subsistence will be. It says he will be paid an attendance fee of $40 per day. Doesn't say you couldn't pay him more. Just says that's what he is entitled to. Now, of course, in the lower courts, you can't pay him more because there is no authority to pay him more. But in the Supreme Court, there is authority to pay him more. That comes out of 1911. I mean, I grant you that this is -- what I'm actually doing here is I'm trying to avoid this problem of whether Congress can start legislating the details of original jurisdiction rules and so forth. Just -- there is some desirability here constitutionally to prevent ourselves from going down that road. That's -- I'm deliberately being gimmicky, but what do you think of this gimmick?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Which part did they think limited it? Was it 1821 they thought limited it?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: In an ordinary case, if a witness doesn't -- never does go to court, but just goes to a deposition, that's the only thing, he goes to a deposition, does he get paid the 40 dollars? He goes to a lawyer's office; he's never in attendance at a court. But do they count that as being in attendance at a court?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: If that isn't attendance at a court, where did these witnesses show up?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Where? Where did they have this proceeding? I don't know. It wasn't here; it wasn't in this--\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: May I ask -- just to put one thing on the table if I could. How do you deal with the problem that Justice Ginsburg raises: If a court wants to appoint an independent expert and pay him more than $40 a day? Do you say that's flatly prohibited? And if it's not flatly prohibited, what is the authority for doing so, other than 1911?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Well, why don't you have inherent authority to pay expert witness fees a little more money, then?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, we would want to get into the business because it's our business; and it seems to me that if you yield on a basic point like this, that you're giving up, who knows how much?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Could I ask you what -- what are the fees to be charged by its clerk, referred to in 1911. \"Supreme Court may fix the fees to be charged by its clerk. \" and then the next paragraph says \"the fees of the clerk\". Is that what the first paragraph refers to, the fees of the clerk? Or does it mean other fees that the clerk charges which could include costs? Are the costs part of the fees to be charged by the clerk?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: They are not? Fees of the clerk -- in 1920 says \"fees of the clerk and marshal. \" but that's to be taxed as costs. Right? A judge or clerk can tax as costs the following. 1911 says Supreme Court may fix \"the fees to be charged by its clerk. \" And you say that doesn't include costs. Boy, it's a messy, messy bunch of statutes, don't you think?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: --What if Congress had done nothing? In other words, let's say they haven't addressed costs at all. Would we be able to set what we think are reasonable attendance costs?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, if we have inherent authority in original jurisdiction cases, where does it -- how come it disappears whenever Congress decides to legislate in the area?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Is the substantive level of fees a mode of proceeding?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Is there any -- do you think $40 a day for an expert is a realistic assessment of what experts charge?\n",
      "David H. Souter: May I just get clear on your view of inherent power? As I understand it, you're -- when you answered it, in a situation in which the slate is completely clean, we would have inherent power, you're using \"inherent power\" in effect to be a kind of default power. If Congress hasn't acted, somebody has got to do something. That's got to be us, so -- so we would have the authority. But you are not using the term \"inherent power\" in the sense of being a power which is sort of essential and indefeasible by Congress in any respect. Is that correct?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Do you think there is -- there is any inherent power in, let's say, this Court -- just keep to it simple -- that Congress in effect could not eliminate? For example, if Congress passed a statute saying the Supreme Court of the United States shall not have authority to punish direct contempt, would that statute be constitutional in your view?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Isn't that a pretty slippery slope then that you're on? Because if in fact parties are going to be reluctant to -- to hire the kind of experts that are necessary, unless they think that at the end of the day there is going to be some kind of an equitable disposition of the expense, at that point that starts interfering with the conduct of the kind of business that the Court ought to be engaged in.\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: --What if Congress -- really you think Congress could set any -- there's not some point at which it is so destructive of the process here? What if Congress provides that the winning -- that the winning party shall pay the costs of the losing party? Can Congress do that?\n",

      "Stephen G. Breyer: I'm sorry. I got mixed up on my dates. The words \"in any court of the United. \" --what the words are now is \"in any court\". It says \"court of the United States includes. \" 451 courts. When did that language come in?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: So the inclusion wasn't there till then. Now, normally, in the '48 revision, the rule is they intended to make no substantive change. When they did intend to make a substantive change, they said as much. So is there anything in the history of that that suggests they intended to make a substantive change here?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: So, in other words, the language \"in addition to the courts listed in section 451 of this title. \" that -- those words I just said have no appearance in the statutes before 1948? Yes or no.\n",

It's you have your U.S. rights and you have your Chinese rights, you have your rights under each jurisdiction's law. And your position is essentially to say that when I sell my Chinese rights to somebody, I'm also selling my U.S. rights to that same person, because the person who has the Chinese rights can just turn around and import the goods. I mean, that's the nature of your position, isn't it, that your U.S. rights are always attached when you sell more -- your rights under the jurisdiction of another country?\n",

      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Does the authority you claim the tribes retain go further than simply detaining a non-Indian on reasonable suspicion? I think you -- you just said in answer to Justice Breyer that a tribal officer could not actually make an arrest. Could the -- could the officer make a -- the kind of search incident to arrest that would otherwise be possible? For example, if a non-Indian was in the car -- in a car, could the officer search areas of the car that the person could grab and might have -- where there might be a weapon hidden?\n",

Could -- what can the officer do under those circumstances?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: Mr. Feigin, basically, you -- in your briefs, you've argued that this Court should look to whether the exercise of tribal sovereignty would be consistent with the overriding interests of the federal government. I'm not quite sure what that has to do with much. Shouldn't we be looking at what rights the Indians, the tribal Indians, have been given? And, here, it seems to me that inherent in a detention-and-hold right is the right to investigation. The Ninth Circuit basically said that they can investigate to find out if someone's an Indian or not. And if they're an Indian, presumably, they would have all the rights of further investigation. But I don't know why the Ninth Circuit's limited view of what the right of detention means should control us.\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: And -- and -- and isn't that a simpler argument than all the arguments that -- about sovereignty that everyone's been having? If it's a contractual right the Indians have been given, there's no constitutional violation in just being held for the police to determine whether or not you're guilty of a crime sufficient to be arrested. Why can't we just go in -- on that simple basis?\n",

And why did you make the choice that you did?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: I guess, Mr. Feigin, I really was just asking about -- you said we just don't think Montana applies. But, other than sort of analytic purity in your mind, you have no -- you don't see any real difference between the two approaches?\n",

      "Neil Gorsuch: Good morning, counsel. I -- I -- I guess I would have approached this thinking that tribal sovereignty remains until and unless Congress has withdrawn it in some fashion and that the relevant question here is, what -- what does the Major Crimes Act do to Indian sovereignty? And, there, it's clear that Congress has withdrawn jurisdiction to try certain non-native people in certain locations within Indian country. Fine. My question approaching it that way, Mr. Feigin, is, where is the line? The Major Crimes Act clearly precludes states or -- or tribes from trying certain individuals, non-native persons, for -- for major crimes in Indian country. But you say it's okay, on the other hand, to -- for a tribal officer to conduct a Terry stop. There's a long distance between a Terry stop and a trial. Where does -- where does the Major Crimes Act kick in to reduce tribal sovereignty?\n",

      "Neil Gorsuch: Oh, yeah, but you're saying they -- they possessed that authority antecedent to any statute. And -- and -- and I guess my question, again, is, where does that sovereign authority end that's been preserved? And why would it stop at Terry as opposed to an arrest?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Feigin. Does the authority here come from the Constitution?\n",

      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: And I -- it's not affirmatively granted by the Constitution. You also said it's not affirmatively granted by Congress, I think you said in response to Justice Sotomayor. Correct?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: The other side says this is, in effect, a separation of powers case and that Congress has given the executive the authority to enter into cross-deputization and that hasn't been done here and that, instead of the courts jumping in, we should let Congress and the Executive Branch fill any public policy holes that may exist. Your response?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: Mr. Feigin, I'd like to go back to your interchange with Justice Gorsuch. You said that the authority -- the investigative authority doesn't extend past Terry stops into arrests because arrests mark the beginning of the adjudicatory process. We -- I -- I didn't quite follow whether you were saying to Justice Gorsuch that the reason why tribes lack authority to arrest is because they are implicitly divested of that authority under the Constitution, so even under the Colville rationale or whether it's the cross-deputization statutes or whether it's our prior cases making clear that tribes lack the authority to finally adjudicate the rights, criminally or civilly, of non-members. So could you just explain to me what it is that takes away that authority, or is it that they never possessed it in the first place?\n",
      "\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Counsel, I -- I think, as Justice Kagan summarized, there's a very important distinction with -- of broader applicability than this case over how you should look at it. Your friend on the other side says there's inherent authority and it hasn't been take -- the question is whether it's been taken away. He cites Colville. I understand your argument to be that, under Montana and subsequent cases interpreting it, there is no inherent authority. But even under Montana, there are exceptions, exceptions in which we've recognized that there is continuing inherent authority, and I wonder why the second exception doesn't apply here. That exception is when the conduct at issue threatens tribal self-governance, self-rule, which we've talked about in terms of political integrity, economic security, health and welfare. What could threaten that more than the idea that you can't do anything about somebody within the reservation that you have good reason to believe is violating criminal law? It would seem to me that's the prototypical case for the exception.\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Right. I think that's a fair -- fair description, but those were, as has been pointed out, regulatory, civil, adjudicatory, and you can certainly argue it makes sense to have a very limited view in -- in that context. But, when you're talking about on-the-ground criminal activity, I wonder if the exception should not be as narrow as it is in those other contexts?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to continue along that line, counsel. The -- let's change the -- the facts in this case just a bit so that rather than the police officer looking and determining that the Respondent was nervous and that he may -- had bloodshot eyes; rather, he fit the description of a serial killer that the police officer was alerted to, a serial killer who did not commit any of the crimes on the reservation but happened to be exactly where Respondent was. How would you -- would you make the exact same argument in that case?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas: So why does he have the authority to -- to detain there but not here when he has suspicions about possibly, not entirely, weapons and drugs?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Well, I'd like to continue. What -- what -- what exactly do you think the tribal officer can do and what can't he do and why?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Well, just in general. I mean, what is the rule? What are the rules that you're -- you're advocating?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: But he's not an Indian. It turns out he's not an Indian tribe member. I mean, you know, people look -- you can't just look at them and see whether -- whether they're Indians or not or -- people look different, so I think that would be a tough one to do. But -- but suppose he turns out -- doesn't look like a member of the tribe. Then what?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: It looks like he's going to take off as soon as you get out of the car or stop or go away from the car. You can detain him there. You can detain him there while you radio. Who do you radio?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: They all have that and they know everybody who's in the tribe and they say, yes, we have a man named Mr. Smith in this tribe. Then what?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: And how does that -- how many of them have done that?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: So, in your opinion, this is a non-problem? All they have to do is get the right paper?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Counsel, it does seem to me that determining whether a person is an Indian, which can mean a member of any tribe, not just the particular tribe whose land is at issue, may be more difficult than you suggest. But what is the tribal officer supposed to do after determining pretty clearly that a person is not an Indian? So consider the situation where the tribal officer has reasonable suspicion that a driver is driving under the influence and would present a danger if allowed to continue to drive, but the officer is pretty certain this person is not an Indian. Let's say the -- the person has a -- a -- a European Union driver's license and shows plane tickets showing that the person arrived in San Francisco two days ago. So it's pretty clear that this person is not an Indian but would present a danger if allowed to continue. What can the tribal officer do there? Just let the person go?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: All right. Well, so this person -- the person is not so drunk that it's plain that alcohol is above the level, but the officer has reasonable suspicion. Can the officer ask the person to come out of the car and perform a field sobriety test?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: It's voluntary. All right. So does it depend on the severity of the offense? What if it is a situation where he has reasonable suspicion that this person had -- is a murderer?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: Why is that subject to the exclusionary rule? Meaning, assuming for the sake of argument that the Indians have a patrol or any neighborhood group has a patrol in their neighborhood and a -- they see someone who they have reasonable suspicion about and detain them for arrest. Would that security -- would that -- any items seized by that person be subject to suppression?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: Or even on the street around my private land. Why are they subject to the Fourth Amendment?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: That question is, why are they subject to the Fourth Amendment, outside of the government's concession?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: The Fourth Amendment -- that -- that has to do with you asking us to create another rule. I'm asking you, under the rules as they exist right now, if you don't consider them sovereign and you don't consider them acting on behalf of the government because they're not deputized, why are they subject to the Fourth Amendment? Why is anything they found subject to the Fourth Amendment suppression rule?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: -- that aside, counsel, what would happen if I, as a private citizen, had reasonable suspicion that someone was a danger, Justice Alito's hypothetical? Would I be justified -- of a drunken driver -- would I be justified in holding that person?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: Mr. Henkel, the government relies in some significant measure on the idea of cross-enforcement authority, in other words, the belief that sovereigns generally have the power to respond to potential violations of another sovereign's laws. Are you contesting that that authority generally exists, in other words, outside the Indian context, or are you accepting that but just saying it's -- it's different in the Indian context?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: -- so -- so you're really -- I mean, on the -- the two alternatives I gave you, you're really resting on the idea that tribal authority is just different from state authority, so that even if we were to find a lot of cross-enforcement as between state officers or as between state officers and the federal government, that doesn't carry over? That's what you're saying?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch: Good morning, counsel. A question for you that I actually would have liked to have gotten to with Mr. Feigin, but time didn't permit. Hopefully, you have some thoughts on it as well. Let's say -- just work with me for the moment and suppose that there is some permissible role here for tribal authorities, and also suppose that in the course of a stop, that the tribal authority engages in some conduct that would violate the Constitution and that your client wanted to pursue a civil claim for that violation if -- if -- of course, in -- in the state context, there would be 1983; in the federal officer context, there would be Bivens. What -- what remedy would be available -- perhaps you haven't given this thought, but, if you have, I'm curious what remedy you think might be available against a tribal officer. Would there be a state law remedy? Would there be some federal remedy? What -- what thoughts do you have there?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch: Have you thought -- and -- and you agree, though, that there would be exclusion under IRCA, right?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch: -- for something that happens on the -- either fee-simple land or, as here, a -- you know, a right-of-way?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Henkel. You make what I think are forceful separation-of-powers arguments, particularly that Congress has provided for cross-deputization, and that was not taken advantage of here. So I take that point, and that's an important one for me. But, at the same time, a couple other thoughts that I'll throw out there, and then you can react to them. The amicus brief from the former U.S. Attorneys says that \"criminal jurisdiction in Indian country is an indefensible morass of complex, conflicting, and illogical commands layered in over decades via congressional policies and court decisions and without the consent of tribal nations.\" And I don't think you're going to disagree with that description necessarily, and so that leads me to think that one of the things we should be trying to do here is -- is to do no harm because there's lots of ripple effects from a broad decision. And with that in mind, there are statements in our decisions in Duro and Strate that really cut directly against you, as you're -- you're well aware. And you can say those are dicta, and that might be correct, but those have guided the law -- law enforcement for several decades. I think Congress and the executive could reasonably rely on those statements in the Court's decision. Certainly, the Cohen treatise treats those statements as authoritative in terms of guidance. So why isn't the best thing we can do here just to stick with what we said in those cases? It's not very analytically satisfying, but it's a narrow result. It does not make a morass, as it was described, any worse. What do you think?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: I'd like to pick up where Justice Kavanaugh left off. I mean, on the one hand, as Justice Kavanaugh points out, it's not very analytically satisfying to rely on the dicta, particularly from the footnote in Strate. But I want to try this on -- you know, you say one problem with our -- you know, or the government's approach or an approach saying that there is some sort of retained authority to police here is that we haven't identified its scope or its source. But, you know, Montana and those cases that followed it relied pretty heavily on the unfairness of imposing tribal law on those who didn't participate in its creation. And in that respect, Strate's footnote is perfectly consistent with that because, as the United States pointed out in argument and in its brief, you know, Cooley and -- and other non-members of the tribe are represented in the creation of federal law. And so it doesn't pose that same problem here. It's -- it's far less of an unfairness, and Strate's footnote can be seen to be consistent with that principle, particularly if the United States is right that one way to understand Montana is that that is an instance of implied preemption that cashes out when you consider the assertion of authority to adjudicate finally civil or criminal liability or the imposition of regulations on those who didn't participate in its exercise. So can you explain to me why that would not be a way to reconcile the Strate footnote and the United States' proposed authority here?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: Well -- well, I under -- I understand that. That was the premise of my question. But why is it unfair, on that rationale, simply to submit him to the authority of a police officer in a temporary stop?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: Okay. Well, let me -- let me just stop you there so I can ask this question too. Justice Thomas was asking you, you know, the same hypothetical as Mr. Cooley's stop but substituting in a serial killer. And -- and you said, well, if he fits the description, then maybe there might be able to be detention. And I assume that that might be an exercise of what the Ninth Circuit described as the apparent or obvious violation of law. That -- that's a new phrase, right? We have reasonable suspicion. We have probable cause. How do you tell if something's an apparent and obvious violation of the law?\n",

The trial court denies it, and he puts on later... the defendant later puts on evidence in his own case. The case goes to the jury, and the jury hangs.

Maybe that is what the law requires, but if it is, it is going to really make a very significant practical difference, I suppose, in the procedure in Massachusetts, and I am wondering if you might address the possibility of some sort of comity and federalism notion of saying, well, the federal court ought to stay its hand until the review has been had in the Massachusetts system.\n",

So, would you write this as a matter of constitutional law? Would it -- shouldn't it be written as a matter of Federal common law of contracts?

We don't know whether the boy himself was culpable, what the degree of culpability was when he participated in taking it or whether he was just along with the boy and now the representation is I don't -- maybe it's yours but basically this whole theme, it has said that the state as I think is parens patriae, the exact thing as sort of a forced father of this boy.

He was picked up and then he has this, whatever you want to call it hearing or whatnot and the end of it is that he is to send away for maximum of six years. Now, if an adult that had done exactly the same thin, he would have been arrested. He would have been tried. He would have been given due process. He would have a right against self-incrimination. He would have had the possibility of appeal. There would have been transcript. There would have been notice in writing. The burden would have been on the state to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. There would have been confrontational witnesses all because he's an adult and the most he could have been put away for is two months. Now, here's a boy that gets picked up and he gets none of these safeguards. No confrontational, most certainly this is at the very least of the monthly record as to whether he admitted his -- that he did it. And he gets sent up for maximum possibility of being deprived of his freedom for six years and why you call one a crime and not the other one a crime?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: But one -- one of the questions here is very simply put. If this boy was sent away for the three incidence that have been here mentioned, the baseball glove incident, and whatever that was, the pocketbook instance whatever that was, and the present incident. What is there in the Juvenile Court fair philosophy? What is there in the theory of the Juvenile Court which makes it undesirable or impossible for this boy to have had the basic elements of a trial with respect to those incidents so that at least he would have known and we would know, reviewing courts would know exactly what these incidents were, what happened, why this boy was sent away for six years. Now, is it your position that doing that would destroy the Juvenile Court theory?\n",

Everybody agrees with that. Do you agree with his second example... I take it you do... that if the bill is sold, just as an outright sale, no repo agreement, just an outright sale, 180 days down the road, that the exemption of 500 dollars is given 250 to each holder?\n",

      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But would you pick one or the... would you be... do you know which one Nebraska would pick if it were required to make that decision?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: That's the key question to me, I mean, these two questions that Justice Kennedy brought up and this. I don't understand this statute, Nebraska 77-2716(e), which is the addback. Now, in order to make this clear, I have to take a second, and I want to use a slightly more realistic example. I mean, you've been arguing is it really a collateralized loan, or is it really a sale? Well, it has some characteristics of each. Is a nectarine really a plum? Is it really a pear? Is it really an... I mean, it's some of each, or whatever. All right. Suppose you start there and say, that doesn't solve it. But what might solve it is that the Government, when it issues the bill at an original issue discount, it's easy to figure out what the interest of that is. The IRS does it all the time, and then you allocate it daybyday, and just say the State can't tax that. Is that right, and if that is right, how does this statute fit into it? I mean, let me give you... suppose that the repoer has 1 million dollars worth of Treasuries, 90-day bills. Let's say they pay 15,000 dollars of interest at 6 percent for 90 days, and suppose what he does is he repos it out to the Ford Motor Company for 1 day, which my calculation says is worth about 167 dollars in interest. That Tbill interest goes right to the repoer. Now, what the repoer has got is, he's got 1 million dollars in cash for a day, and he's had to pay, say, 150 dollars for it. Does this Nebraska statute mean on his tax return he puts in 167 dollars of taxfree interest, and then reduces that by 150 dollars? To me, that's an odd reading of the statute, because I would say the 150 is not an expense of this repo transaction. Rather, it's an expense related to whatever transaction he will engage in with the 1 million dollars cash that he's got. He might, for example, take in... I guess that's called a reverse. He takes in 1 million dollars of Treasuries from Solomon Brothers, and what he hopes to do is charge them 152 dollars for that 1-day's use of the million, so he's got 152 dollars, subtracts the 150, and it's 2. That's how I'd read that statute of Nebraska. But they've said, your opponents, that isn't how it's read, the 150 dollars is allocated to the 167 dollars, and now I want to know from you, is it, or isn't it? Have you followed... have you followed it all right? I'm sorry to be so... but you see what I'm saying? I'm saying that the payment to Ford, the payment to Ford from the repoer, is a payment for the 1 million dollars in cash that the repoer got. It shouldn't be allocated to the 167 interest on those Treasury bills that are in the hands of Ford for the day. It should be allocated to whatever income that million dollars is used in the hands of the repoer to generate. Is that the right reading of the statute? If it is, you are only taxing the... you're not... you're leaving the whole 10 percent, or whatever it is, free of tax. If it isn't, you're taxing some of it. If it's too complicated to follow, forget it. I'm sorry. I'll have to find out the answer. The question is, I want to know how this particular statute works, (e).\n",

Is not the buyer the owner during that period?\n",

We're going to have to examine these repo agreements one by one to determine what... you know, what the economic reality of this particular repurchase agreement is.

      "Stephen G. Breyer: Then he has to... he then looks at the statue and says, but I paid 4,000. I paid 4,000 to the holder of the bills when they were repoed. Does he have to, in effect, subtract the 4,000 from the 5,000 so he only has 1,000, or does he not?\n",

The others all said the Government took our land, we want to be compensated, and then there was a determination.

Your...  your brother has pointed out to us that on page 10a of the...  the red brief, the terms of the settlement are set out. The terms of the settlement cover occupational trespass damage, lack of...  loss of rents, as well as certain takings for the canal, and levies and so on. And they got $ 15 million for that, which suggests to me that if there had been a settlement which took into...  which...  which had been a settlement for a taking and had valued the land in fee, the amount of the settlement would have been more than $ 15 million. Can we not bear in mind the amount that they got and say that tends to support the argument that, despite the language and despite the language of the statute, the only thing they were settling, in effect, was an occupational claim, a trespass kind of claim, plus a few incidental takings? Is...  is that an illegitimate line of reasoning?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Because you can't have it...  you say all of the above. The answer to that is you can't have it both ways. They...  they settled on...  on a...  if...  if they had...  if they had come up with...  let's put it this way. If they had come up with a settlement that said, we don't know, but regardless of whether your claims are for trespass or whether your claims are for taking, we'll give you this and you take this and you go away, that would have been a situation in which there would have been total ambiguity and there would have been no way to go behind the general language that you quote. Here, however, there is a way to go behind it, and if...  if you accept the general principle that you can't have it both ways, why not go behind it and give effect to what they actually agreed upon?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: That's entirely fair to play it both ways as against the Government. We don't know what the money was for, whether it was for the trespass or for the taking. You waived them both. So, as against the United States, you can't claim either one. Fair. But when you try to apply the same principle against other parties, you have to make up your mind which of the two you're going to impose on the other parties.

And with this kind of a...  of a settlement, you have no way of knowing which of the two to impose. You have to impose the one or the other. Which one of the two does this settlement require us to impose on third parties? You can't say both because they lead to inconsistent results.\n",

You could have two parties who want to transfer land for some reason, and then suddenly everybody else is cut off. They didn't have a chance to appear. They had no...  I mean, who knows what third parties have claims against the Government or against the tribe? And why should two parties be able to get together and quiet title as against the world? I don't see that.\n",

We think that our judges in the Superior Court don't know very much about building disputes. Now, I say it is a hypothetical because, in fact, Superior Court judges in California are excellent judges. But California thinks, no, they don't know enough about it. So here's what we do. We say when Jones and Smith enter into an arbitration agreement, if it happens to concern a building dispute, they have to go to Federal... they can go to the Superior Court. In fact, if they want to, if one of them wants to, the other one doesn't. And everything is delayed while the Superior Court judge decides all the issues in the case.

      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Right, so you at least have that additional step. It is... particularly since you only have 10 days to appeal from the labor commissioner, someone who wants to arbitrate has to appeal, has to go to superior court and get a motion to compel. You can't even wait to see if your opponent goes to superior court and... well, if he has won, he wouldn't go into court. But you have to go to the court to get a motion to compel? You can't just go ahead and proceed with arbitration.\n",

Well, who determines if the parties have executed a valid and applicable arbitration agreement?\n",

      "Antonin Scalia: --Well, I don't understand... so you incorporate California law. I interpret that to mean substantive law of California. You say also incorporates... and this is what I find peculiar. California law gives you a procedural right to go to the labor commission. But it also gives you a procedural right to go to superior court. And, yet, you acknowledge that the arbitration agreement, when you say we will arbitrate, forecloses your using the superior court. Why doesn't it foreclose your using the labor commissioner? I don't understand how you slice the bologna that thin. To me, if it excludes California procedures, it excludes both the labor commissioner and the superior court.\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: How can we decide this case on the assumption that this is simply an arbitration postponing rule when there's no California case that says that, do you acknowledge? And a party resisting arbitration could well argue that the California Code means that you go first to the Labor Commissioner and then, as the statute says explicitly, the parties are entitled to a de novo review before the Superior Court without making any provision for arbitration. Do you think it is inconceivable the California courts could interpret the statute to mean that, that there's no room for arbitration in the... in this scheme?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: All right. I will amend it. The California Superior Court is ex officio smarter than the Labor Commissioner, okay? And yet, one of the parties who thinks the Labor Commissioner is dead wrong doesn't get a chance to have this advice corrected the way the California constitution envisions, by the ex officio smarter Superior Court.\n",

That's what both... all the judges on the California court agreed with that. So I'm asking, doesn't that make... require qualification of your statement at page 34 that these procedures are expeditious and informal and do not entail additional expense or delay? All of--\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: All right. Does it also require some qualification in you brief where, at page 12, you say Preston clearly and repeatedly sought to procure employment for Ferrer in the television industry? Our rules say that you cannot raise matters for the first time in this Court. And you have no evidence on that point.\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: I know you didn't, and that's why I'm questioning why you put it in your brief. Doesn't that require some qualification?\n",

And if you have repeated statements in your brief that require qualifications, if in your former argument in Marshal, the Court is concerned with the accuracy of one of your citations, shouldn't we view with some skepticism what you tell us?\n",
      "\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Regardless of the... I now understand better than I did what I take as a pretty strong argument. I'm not saying convincing, but strong. And that would be this: If you go look at Volt, and in Volt the Court said that the California Code meant that the individual who'd entered into the arbitration contract could go and can ask a superior court to stay an arbitration while some unrelated... some unrelated... I mean directly related but not the same parties... litigation took place. The Court didn't in Volt say that that question of interpreting this contract is for the arbitrator. I don't know why it didn't. But it didn't. Now here he's making a parallel argument. He's saying that the California Code says that people should first go to that Labor Commissioner and that you can stay arbitration while that goes on. Now... and I say well, why don't you go to the arbitrator? He says I don't want to go to the arbitrator on that one, but he points to Volt. And so the puzzle is this: if the Court in Volt didn't say this is a matter for the arbitrator, whether the contract really means that you promise not to go into court and make a motion to stay, why here is it a matter for the arbitrator whether you implicitly promised not to go into court and asked him to stay pending the outcome of this administrative proceeding? What do you think about that?\n",

You, the undersigned are directed to appear before a particular court at a time and place, laying inside all other business and sometimes it will recite on pane of penalties of the law for failure to appear, and you seem to dismiss that as ministerial duty?\n",

      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: It doesn't seem to be right in those pages. 263 through 267, is it?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: -- 3 through 267. I'm going to advert to something which appears on pages 26 -- on page 265 known as general notes. Item one, “ No employee shall lose any benefits or suffer any reduction of salary by virtue of the signing an application of agreement.” From that moment on, we were on the horns of a dilemma for this reason. The evidence in the case disclosed and this was a rather lengthy trial. I tried this case before the Board, before trial examiner and the issue was controverted except that I would say with respect to what I am about to tell the Court now, I don't believe there was any controvertible issue and that is that this company like a lot of other prominent companies in its field, without necessity, have to have and it did have a wage and salary cut, with merit reviews, promotions, classifications, etcetera. This is especially true in the case of professional employee such as engineers, designers, draftsmen, who were within -- who were in this bargaining unit. You are unable to keep people of that caliber unless there was some sort -- sort of a progression system. Now, we had this merit review system, we have these demands and the Union says, “Do not take anything away.” So the minute we do it, we're charged with infringing upon the Union's prerogative. However, as it's pointed out in Judge Frankfurter's opinion in the Insurance Agents case and then Judge Waterman's decision in the Court of Appeals in our case, an employer was torn between two poles. He's got to bargain with the Union collectively in good faith. But by the same token, he's got a business to run and you've got to be realistic, you've got to be practical. So you're -- you're walking a tight rope which is well-oiled and greased and God know if you fall down. And this is the posture that we find the basic facts of this case to be framed. Now, far from the contention which I have heard voiced by -- by the Solicitor General that there might be an inference of sham bargaining. Your Honors I say to you, this did not happen in this case. There was long, intensive bargaining and many sessions that went on for a period for about nine months or 10 months. And every time we met, we lived up to the word of Samuel (Inaudible). We gave each and -- on each and every occasion more and more until finally in April or May 1957 and this is in the record, we gave the Union improved vacations, improved holidays or 17 and a half dollar package spread over a period of three years. We gave them progressions. Well, you mentioned it, we gave it, that was the patent of our so-called sham bargaining. And the reason I illustrate that is because it is not without reason that the Board refused to go along with the trial examiner's findings and conclusions that there was an absence of good faith or let's put it on another way that there was bad faith in the bargaining by this employer. With this finding, the Board did not go along. And it is in this general cradle, in this crucible that we must now draw the line between the former doctrines ever enunciated before the amendment of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947 and those that follow. The decision which was cited by the Solicitor General are all decisions that were pre-Taft-Hartley, Medo, all these other cases were pre-Taft-Hartley. Section 8 (d) which was the subject matter of considerable discussion both in Congress both in the House and in the Senate and which finally there was joint conference report, both agreed. They wanted to eliminate once and for all the tenuousness of an employer's position when it came to collective bargaining. In other words, how far did you have to go? At what point could you say that there was an impasse? At which point did you give all you could possibly give? At what point was there good faith or bad faith? Did you have to come to a collective agreement in order for somebody to say to you, “You're not guilty of bad faith?” So they enacted Section 8 (d). So these decisions or these opinions which were referred to by the petitioner are in acts and as Judge Frankfurter roughly pointed out in his concurring opinion in the Insurance Agents case, there was a distinction between those cases which preceded and those which followed the amendment to the Taft-Hartley law, Section 8 (d). That leads us now to the principle facet of this case, because if we conclude as I believe we should in the face of the present decisions and the amendment of the Act Section 8 (d) then there is justification for Judge Waterman's decision, because then we cannot isolate and fractionate some -- what I would call de minimis because these little violations that were committed on this case and the overall posture of all the facts was in the nature of de minimis violations, that's exactly what it was. They were clinging to a straw in order to sustain these charges because despite what they say that we changed the sick leave and I'll assume arguendo that we did, and I might say that we did because the record abounds with evidence that this was not a change that diminished anything. This was a change to prevent the constant abuses which we had not only with the professional employees but with our white collar personnel and they numbered into the hundreds. They were simply misusing the privilege that we gave them. So we didn't take anything away, but we added an incentive to what they had in order to avoid the continuance of this general bad relation which we had.\n",

How can that be enough to make you a prevailing party if it isn't enough to keep the case alive?\n",

That is all he ever asked for. He is then released while this case is pending on appeal.

It begins by saying, you're right, there seems to be a flat violation of the Constitution. Too bad, however, you have no standing to raise it.

Under this statute, it is equally an offense to forcibly resist, oppose, impede, intimidate or interfere with any person designated in Section 253. Now, let's take the situation where 10 officers come to a person's home or establishment to execute some process or to -- to arrest him or for some other -- other purpose. The 10 people are in front of him and he waves a gun at them and he says, “You cannot come in this house, any of you. If you do, I will kill you.” Which is directed against all 10 of these people, he doesn't pull the trigger, all he does is forcibly resist, oppose, impede, intimidate and interfered with them. Would you say in that situation that he had committed 10 crimes because the Government said 10 officers and that because they sent 10 officers instead of one that he could be punished for 100 years, instead of 10 years?\n",
      "Earl Warren: Yes. But you pointed to the legislative history of it to -- to bring this -- make this a general law instead of having a variety of laws which apply only to -- to certain kinds of officers. And then each one of those, I noticed according to the letter of Attorney General Cummings, the word, “resist” is in, or “impede” and so forth. Now, it's all in one -- it's all in one paragraph, all together. Now, what is there in the legislative history to indicate that if he actually assaulted the officers, you could charge more than one offense, but if he only resisted, he impeded or interfered with them, that you could only charge one?\n",

Don't you suppose they would've said, sure it's a different -- it makes a difference to us, whether as a matter of liaison, you think a young woman across the North River, Jersey or from Jersey.

Would you say that he had committed 10 crimes and he could be sent to penitentiary for 30 years instead of just three years, because there were 10 men present and he -- he struggled with them and resisted and impeded and -- and did all the other things that -- that the Act says. He assaulted them too, and would you say that the Congress would intend that in that situation that they could charge 10 crimes against him and convict him of and sends him to the penitentiary for 30 years instead of three?\n",

That's a more difficult case than will happen in most. We think in most cases, it will be fairly easy to tell that the second investigation concerns a matter that's entirely separate from the first, I mean, that for example occurred here.

It doesn't seem to me that you have people out there walking around, some of whom never want to talk without a lawyer, and others of whom always want to talk without a lawyer.

Under what you want us to do, there's no way that could happen, because the first time in connection with the first charge, I've said, I want a lawyer. I'm too poor to get a lawyer.

That's going to be pretty hard for them to get attorneys' fees anyway because there's a very tough standard. But why isn't a simple rule the best rule? If the case is over, the defendant won, he is the prevailing party for purposes of that case. Then we could go on to take all the things you wanted to into account when we consider what kind of fee is reasonable and when we consider whether it's based on frivolousness. I mean, the -- the plus of that, to me, is the simplicity. And -- and I don't see how it would work any unfairness or serious harm to the objective of this statute.

But have you heard of the Hatfields and the McCoys? You see -- you see why I bring them up? Because they're going to be fighting each other for 30 years. And if you tell them they can't sue in this district, they'll change the complaint slightly and go to a different district. So if I adopt the standard you're just suggesting, I will discover a whole host of questions: Is this really the same suit? What about the possibility that they could have sued in Tasmania? And what about the possibility -- you -- you see where I'm going. And so I'm back, again, to that kind of concern, an administrative concern --\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Wouldn't it be an adequate response to your concern if fees were awarded solely on the ground in which the case was dismissed? That would be -- in other words, the judge would have the discretion to do that. If the judge looks at this and says, okay, it's clear you're in the wrong venue, you know, and hours of research would have showed you that. So, you know, it's frivolous on that ground, and I'm throwing the case out because the -- the defendant prevails on that ground. Now, the defendant may have spent a lot of other money with depositions and everything else. But the judge could say, well, you can file the -- the case again tomorrow. You probably will. You just have to go into the next district. So I a.m. going to award fees. They're going to be equal to the amount of time the defendant had to spend defending against your frivolous venue assertion. It doesn't have to do that. I mean, you know, if you have the wrong venue, and they spend five years doing depositions because you have the wrong venue, they should probably get fees for all of it. But if it's just, you know, a small portion, easily disposed of, is that a possible remedy?\n",

Alito, Jr.: Well, and that's -- in a case like that, what if the -- the EEOC after that dismissal goes back and looks at these cases and says, you know what, we really have nothing here, and therefore, chooses not to bring the case, you would say that because the -- because the first case was dismissed without prejudice, there could be no fees?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Then what is the argument? I take it your argument now is what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Buckhannon says that a plaintiff can't recover, even if he litigates to death and they find -- give up and pay him a billion dollars. Unless there is a judicially sanctioned change in legal relationship, he can't recover fees. And if he can't recover it, why should the defendant recover, unless there is a judicially sanctioned change in relationships and the only candidate for such a thing is a dismissal with prejudice of some form.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Okay. Got the argument. So if that's the argument, and that argument is correct, why don't we have the situation here? Because you heard the judgment being read. It says \"with prejudice.\"\n",

In other words, there's no -- under some sense, there's no incentive for them to conciliate, because if it turns out they didn't, they have to go conciliate. But if they were subject to fees because they ignored their duty to conciliate, it seems to me that might give them some incentive to get it right the first time.\n",

I understand your points about -- your point about Dr. Ragusa, but I just point out that other experts before the court and he himself said that geography was very much embedded as part of the structure of his analysis. You may disagree with that. It's going to be very hard for you to show that no fact finder could credit that understanding of his testimony.

      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, one may read Cooper a different way. Cooper was a case in which there was a lot of direct evidence, was there not?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: Well, let me ask you, how could there be direct evidence really in this kind of case? So this is what I'm a little concerned about because, to the extent that this distinction's turning on whether or not there is direct evidence, I wonder if it is reasonable to require such evidence or -- or say that such evidence would exist in a situation that is not a majority/majority -- a majority/minority district scenario. You can see how there would be direct evidence when the state's goal is to try to, in its view, comply with the VRA, they're trying to make a majority/minority district, so we're going to have some evidence of people saying that. But, in a situation like this, where that is not the case, where the state is saying instead, we are trying to, you know, achieve a partisan tilt, I guess I don't understand -- and, excuse me, we've also said that its, you know, intent to use race is a very hard thing to prove just on its own. Are you asking that we have the smoking gun in a situation like this?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: But are you requiring that? Could we ever -- could we ever make this showing on circumstantial evidence alone? There were some amicus briefs related to computer drawings and that sort of thing that they thought would be particularly helpful in this context.\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: Putting that aside, there were alternative maps here that showed that if race wasn't used, the map would not look like this. So it didn't show what you're saying. But we go back, let's assume, let's move back past the map because I think Cooper was petulantly clear that you don't need a smoking gun, and if you don't need a smoking gun, you don't need direct evidence. What are the other legal errors?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: -- it rejected -- the person who drew it was Mr. Roberts? Mr. -- and it disclaimed his credibility. So whatever the legislature said in terms of their intent is irrelevant. It's what he did, and the Court did not believe that he didn't use race. It said so.\n",
      "Elena Kagan: That's the legal error, is that they didn't correctly weigh the evidence?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Mr. Gore, is there -- is there anything suspicious about the fact that a map-drawer knows the racial demographics of the state or has available the racial demographics of the state? Haven't we spoken about that?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: -- to the contrary. A presidential election is what doesn't measure turnout in a non-presidential year correctly. I mean, I'll just ask you this. There are two maps, let's -- let's say you have before you, that -- that -- where the election data says these districts favored President Trump. One has a 20 percent BVAP, and the other has a 17 percent BVAP. Now doesn't any map-maker look and say, you know, I would rather have the 17 percent BVAP in order to make sure that going forward this continues to be a Republican district?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: -- would you rather have the 20 percent BVAP or the 17 percent BVAP?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: How do you explain the consistency? I mean, my understanding is that thousands of people were moved in and out of this district, and yet that line, the line concerning the amount of, you know, Black voter -- adult voter participation remained the same. So, if that was not -- if -- if what the court found here was not happening, how do you explain the consistency of that line?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: -- was it ever higher than the 17? People were being moved around, and you would assume --\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: But 80 percent of the Black people were moved out. Am I wrong about that?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: I'm sorry, you said 93 percent? I thought it was 82.8 percent.\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: And so how do you account for the fact that 68.9 percent of whites go to CD1, but only 50.65 percent of Blacks do that are Democrats? So you're controlling for partisanship, and the numbers are that disparate.\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: -- for the legislature to say, I was looking at partisanship, but I'm not looking at whether someone was white or Black, but I'm going to separate CD1 so that it's a hundred miles apart in one county and the only commonality is that they live along I-26 a hundred miles apart? And I'm going to join those two Black sections or get rid of them and keep whites there, even though they've got -- they're -- they're -- even though the Democrats could have been moved?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: We're trying -- we're looking at intent here. So don't those effects say something about the intent and whether or not the court -- it was plausible -- I thought, you know, clear error standard was plausible -- it was plausible for the district court to believe or disbelieve the \"we're not looking at race\" statement made by the person who was putting this together?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch: Well, there's some expert that said -- and I'm sorry to interrupt -- but there's some expert that said the absentee -- a consultant said, I believe it was, that the absentee ballots in the presidential data weren't properly allocated. What's the response to that?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: If I could just, you know, summarize what you just said, you think it's clear error on the court's part that it did not accept the view -- clear error that it did not accept the view that racial data would have helped the mapmakers draw a more secure Republican gerrymander?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Thank you, Mr. Gore. If I could move to a 30,000-foot perspective, how do you understand what we're supposed to do in evaluating clear error? I mean, we have just an appendices in this case that is like that, and let's say there are a hundred different factual determinations. If we think 15 of them are wrong, do we reverse for clear error in that -- in that situation?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Or -- or does it take more? We don't normally review -- other than in these cases, we don't normally review a record for factual findings, and I'm just wondering how you think we should do that.\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, the clear error standard, if that's the standard that we are required to apply, is a very demanding standard, but it is not an impossible standard, and it doesn't mean that we simply rubber-stamp findings by a district court, particularly in a case like this, where we are the only court that is going to be reviewing those findings and particularly in a case in which the -- the basis for a judgment in favor of the prevailing party relies very heavily, if not entirely, on expert reports, the methodology of which can be examined. So, in light of that, I want to ask you about a -- an alleged flaw in Dr. Ragusa's analysis that you mention on page 21 of your reply brief, and Dr. Ragusa's expert report may turn out to be crucial in this case because is it not correct that all of the other experts failed to control for partisanship?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: All right. So you say on page 31 that Dr. Ragusa's analysis is flawed because it \"used total numbers instead of percentages for VTDs' racial and political compositions.\" That's what I understand you're saying, is that in determining whether a VTD was moved out or moved in for a political reason, as opposed to -- for a racial reason, as opposed to a political reason, Dr. Ragusa looked only to the number of votes cast for President Biden in those districts. Is that -- is that the problem, rather than the net Biden vote over the Trump vote?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Okay. Can I ask you one more question, and that concerns Mr. Roberts and his job and his background. Am I correct that he is -- he is employed by the legislature?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: And has been employed by the legislature for some period of time?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: And he draws maps for both Republicans and Democrats?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: You know, on each expert, you take potshots and say they failed to do this, they failed to do that. But we've never required one perfect expert to testify to all aspects of a case, but I worry that your methodology is going to suggest that what we do now is do exactly that and instead of looking at the gestalt, which is what the district court did, not the gestalt, but the whole picture. So you discount all four of the plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Ragusa, but there were three others. Two of the experts accounted for partisanship but not geography, and two others accounted for geography but not partisanship. There's no rule that requires one expert to do all of it. And even with Dr. Ragusa, his purpose for his choices were not your purposes. His purposes for his choices were to show that VTDs with a particular percentage of Blacks were going to be selected over white districts, and that proof he made. So I'm wondering, where would the clear error standard come in for us to be doing what Justice Alito did in picking one factor and saying this is a critical flaw that can't be made up by the circumstantial evidence around it from all other three experts?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: So, if I come away from this looking at all four experts and looking at other cases where we accepted that expert testimony even with the pointed-out flaws, does that defeat your argument?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: And just to continue in Justice Sotomayor's line of questioning, you have two experts here, Ragusa and Liu, who answer the exact question that is supposed to be answered in such a case. In other words, is this gerrymander based on politics, or is it a way to get to an ultimate goal, an ultimate political goal, but the gerrymandering is based on race? And what the two of them do is that they show that Black Democrats are excluded from District 1 at a far greater percentage than white Democrats are. So, you know, Liu says, what is it, 61 percent -- now I'm going to lose it -- 69 percent of white Democrats were -- were -- remained in the district, whereas only 51 percent of Black Democrats did. Ragusa's analysis, similarly clear, a little bit harder to state in one sentence. But -- but both experts essentially said: Look, we've done these regressions, and we can show you that Black Democrats and white Democrats are not being treated the same way, that Black Democrats are being excluded for the district at a far greater proportion. So, you know, every regression analysis has things that you can poke holes in, but you didn't give anything in response to that. It's not like you said: We have a better regression analysis. We controlled for more things and we can show you that the -- that the effect disappears. You're saying that it was clear error to credit the plaintiffs' experts dealing with the exact question under review and finding statistically significant results, to credit those experts over your nothing.\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: What was the Black voting population in District 1 in that map?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: I have a question about Dr. Ragusa's expert report. I just want to make sure that I understand, because the circumstantial evidence is what the plaintiffs relied on, and the whole issue is disentangling race and partisanship. I understood your brief to say, but you haven't said this yet that I heard, so I want to make sure I understand it correctly, that he did not take into account factors like contiguousness and compactness, and so he was assuming that you could have essentially kind of an island cut off in the middle of the district that would have more Black voters, which would obviously then not be contiguous. Am I misunderstanding that?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: And how much of a point did you make of that in the district court?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: Yeah, can I drill down on that a little bit? Because I think that's at the heart of one of my concerns about the burdens and some of the questions that we've heard. So you put on Mr. Trende at the district court, and my understanding was that Mr. Trende did not really, as an expert, undercut the methodologies of Ragusa and the other experts. Is that -- is that correct? I mean, he didn't put forward an alternative or do a kind of methodological analysis of Ragusa, did he?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: And what if the district court disagreed? I mean, the district court ultimately relies on Ragusa's expert -- expertise, and you say that you challenged, although you did not really bring an expert report that met Ragusa at the same level, but you -- you raised the objections, and the district court disagreed apparently, right?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: Okay. So I guess what I'm concerned about is that I kind of hear you wanting us to do a de novo review, as opposed to a clear error review, because, to the extent that you're now asking us to look at the flaws in Ragusa's testimony and I guess disagree with the district court's crediting that -- that -- that report, that sounds to me like de novo. I understood from Cooper that the clear error standard -- and I had it here a second ago -- is a highly deferential standard, that the Court may not reverse just because it would have decided the matter differently. A finding that is plausible in light of the full record, even if another is equally or more so, must govern. So to what extent do we have to credit the district court's disagreement with your objections to Ragusa's report?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: -- but wasn't there other -- I'm sorry. Wasn't Cromartie II a majority/minority district scenario?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: But how does clear error work in that? Like, I understood the standard now, post-Cooper, to be is it plausible that the district court could have relied on Ragusa's testimony and could have found it to be reliable. And in the absence of a defense expert that's actually poking methodological holes in it, I think you have a hard time, you know, if our burden is just to say was it plausible that the district court got it right in terms of the -- of the crediting of Ragusa's report?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: -- includes both the expertise and also the district court's credibility findings? Which is another sort of aspect of this that I really wanted to pin down. You say the district court ignored other evidence. But it did have a trial, and it had the actual person who drew the maps come in, and there's testimony in the record where the court itself is questioning directly, not relying on the attorneys, but actually putting questions to that -- that map-drawer. And I'm just wondering how we are to assess the court's determination that it disagreed with or didn't believe the expert when he said, I was looking at -- at partisanship and not race.\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: So are you saying the court could not have disagreed -- I mean, they asked him the question, moving that line up into the African American areas of North Charleston you would say was for a partisan lean, correct? And the witness says yes. And they ultimately find that that's not so. So why isn't that a -- a -- a finding, I disagree, I don't believe you?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: So what would a plaintiff have needed -- and this is my final question. I'm short on time. What would a plaintiff have need -- have needed in your view, direct evidence, a statement that says we are using race and not partisanship in this particular area?\n",

      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: And -- and you're trying to -- to carry it without any direct evidence, with no alternative map, with no odd-shaped districts, which we often get in gerrymandering cases, and with a wealth of political data that you're suggesting your friends on the other side would ignore in favor of racial data. Have we ever had a case like that with that combination? We usually are looking for those sorts of things and we have those. Have we ever had a case before where all it is is circumstantial evidence?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Sorry to interrupt. And that is to change the voting percentage in the district by how much?\n",

      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Yeah, I think this goes to what Mr. Gore claims is a very serious flaw in Dr. Ragusa's methodology, and I want you to talk about that. Maybe you have a good answer to his argument. So let's say the Republican legislature is intent on ensuring that District 1 has a Republican lead. Then, all else being equal, which of the following two precincts would they rather include in District 1: a district with -- a precinct with 3,000 residents that went 900 to 800 for Trump, 900 votes for President Trump, 800 votes for President Biden, or a precinct with the same number of residents, 3,000, that went 700 to 600 for Biden, 700, okay, 700 votes for President Biden, 600 for Trump? Which one would you rather include if you're a Republican legislature that wants to produce a Republican-leaning district?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, suppose you don't know anything -- you don't know anything about race, which is what they claim, not that they know -- they didn't take race into account at all. All you had before you were those statistics: 900 to 800 for Trump, 700 to 600 for Biden. You want to make it a Republican district. Which one do you want to keep in?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: But what I just said is his methodology, is it not? He looked at the absolute number of votes for President Biden, not the percentage, not the net votes.\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Yeah, I -- I'm concerned about what has been said here earlier about Mr. Roberts. And as I -- I asked Mr. Gore about that. Is it not true that he has a long record working for the legislature and he's drawn maps for both Republicans and Democrats?\n",

      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: He's complimentary of his -- of his honesty, right?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Okay. So then the district court turns around in its opinion and says that his testimony rings hollow. So that's a nice way of saying that he lied, right?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: It -- it gave three reasons for it, and I want you to tell me which one of these is defensible. The third one is what you just mentioned, his in-depth knowledge of the racial demographics of South Carolina. Is that damning?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: All right. That's one. The second one is Roberts failed to provide the court with any plausible explanation for the abandonment of his least change approach in drawing the Charleston County portions of Congressional District Numbers 1 and 6 or the subordination of traditional districting principles, including maintenance of constituencies, minimizing divisions of counties, and avoidance of racial gerrymandering. So they say he gave no plausible explanation for that?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Didn't -- didn't he say that his -- he was aiming to produce a Republican district?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Yeah. But -- but isn't that a plausible explanation for all of those things?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: -- is it a -- is it a plausible reason? I mean, did they say, we don't believe Mr. Roberts because, you know, he had a shifty look on the stand and this is a guy with a partisan background? Did they say anything like that? They gave three reasons.\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: All right. So, in -- and the last one is he admitted that his movement of nearly 17,000 African Americans was inconsistent with the Clyburn staff plan for Charleston County that he claimed to be faithfully following, right? Did he ever say, we followed exactly what -- what Congressman Clyburn asked us to do? Did he ever say that?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Let me come back to the question I asked about why your experts did not produce an alternative map. Dr. Imai produced 10,000 maps, right?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Yeah, he ran a simulation with 10,000 maps. He never considered politics?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, in a -- in a case that's all about disentangling race and politics, how can we possibly give any weight to an expert report that did not take politics into account at all purportedly?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: The defense expert, Sean Trende or Trende, evaluated Dr. Ragusa's maps and found that Democrats would win District 1 in over 90 percent of the maps that Dr. Ragusa produced. Did Dr. Imai run a simulation using the political data as well but then decide to shelve it when the results were not favorable to your client?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: It just never occurred to him that politics might have something to do with this?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: All right. Dr. Imai did not control for politics. Did the district court rely on Dr. Liu?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Okay. Last question. I'm sorry to go on for so long. Did Dr. Liu and Dr. Ragusa use the county envelope method?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Under that method, if there are two people who live in the same apartment building, under the county envelope method, could one -- does the analysis take into -- presume that one can be moved and the other can't?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: One could stay in -- in -- in a district and the other could move?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Does it assume that a -- that all precincts could be moved, regardless of their location?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: I understood the record the way you did, but I understood that Dr. Liu was asked to produce maps that were consistent with the traditional criteria that the state indicated it had used, correct?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: So he never looked at partisanship because that wasn't one of the criteria that it at first said it had used, correct?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: So I know it seems strange, but as I understood the record -- and I know Justice Alito thinks that it should have been assumed that partisanship would be the defense -- do you know if the answer in this case raised partisanship as a defense?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: So you were relying on what they said during the process?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: So what your experts showed was that everything they said during the legislative process had to be race-based in some way because that's what the evidence showed. They couldn't explain the large movement of Blacks as opposed to whites, Blacks as opposed to -- or Democrat -- Democratic whites and Black. So they had to come up with a different reason for why they did what they did, correct?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: On the least change point that you mentioned, my understanding, but I want to get your understanding of the record, was that Senator Campsen wanted Beaufort and Berkeley Counties to be kept whole, he wanted a stronger Republican tilt, and he wanted Representative Clyburn to represent some of Charleston County because of Representative Clyburn's clout in the -- in the Congress and with the administration. So, if you -- if those things are accurate -- and I just want your understanding of the record -- then doesn't that mean you couldn't draw the first district without some significant changes?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: Right. I understand that principle, of course. But West Ashley was predominantly white and predominantly Democratic and then was moved out, right?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: Your point is there's a higher percentage then of Blacks than whites moved out?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: So I guess I'm still struggling with this clear error standard and the application in this context. Justice Alito asked a number of questions about the reasons that the district court highlighted for why it did not credit Mr. Roberts' testimony. And I guess, consistent with what I understood the clear error standard to require of us, I didn't know that we were to evaluate whether we agreed or disagreed with each of their findings, whether we would have found -- you know, had a different takeaway from the fact that, you know, his testimony, the district court said it -- it rang hollow. If we thought it didn't rang -- ring hollow, would that be a basis for clear error? Do I not understand what the clear error standard is?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: -- as well so that if the district court said we don't believe he gave a plausible explanation and we look at it and we think the explanation is plausible, that distinction, the fact that we disagree with that particular subsidiary finding, is not the basis for clear error, is that right?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: So it -- so maybe -- maybe you would have clear error if, for example, the district court didn't have any subsidiary findings, if they didn't say anything about Dr. Roberts; they just say, you know, nothing maybe. But, in this case, they did have three reasons, right, why they didn't agree with him? So I guess I just want to be clear as to what we're looking at from -- from the standpoint of clear error.\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: All right. Let me ask about the hypothetical that Justice Alito put forward with respect to moving in 900 Trump voters versus -- you know, a district with 900 Trump voters and 600 Biden voters versus a district with 700 Biden voters and 600 Trump voters. I may have gotten that wrong, but I think if -- I think his point was that if politics is at play, then, clearly, you'd want to bring in the district with more Trump voters if you are trying to get a Republican tilt. And I think that's -- I think that's right, but I guess what I am trying to understand is how the BVAP stays the same unless you're looking at race so that if you bring in the district with more Trump voters, the assumption, I think, that everybody seems to be operating under is that you would -- that district would likely have more white voters in it because race is correlating with -- with -- with politics. And if that's the case, then I would expect bringing that district in, the BVAP would drop. And yet, here, it stayed the same, and I understood your argument to be, because Black voters elsewhere were moved out, that race was used to move out Black voters in a -- when you brought in the 900 Trump voter district. Is that the point that you're making?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: And you're saying that that is the unlawful application of racial gerrymandering. So even though, as Justice Kavanaugh pointed out, the sort of overall BVAP remains the same, in a situation in which you're bringing in more white voters and moving out Black voters, in -- in this kind of circumstance, you're still relying on race in a way that is, you say, improper?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: And as Justice Kagan said, we -- we kind of think that racial -- your argument is that racial data was really kind of driving this because they didn't have a robust set of political data that they were drawing from in order to do this?\n",

      "Clarence Thomas: And that is -- it's the -- again, the vote dilution claim. It seems as though those were collapsed into one another, the redistribute -- the redistricting and the vote dilution, and dealt with on -- on the same standard. So I'm wondering, if the standard is intent with respect to the dilution claim, if you don't see that intent here, why should we remand it?\n",

Can you think of one where your office has done that before?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Yeah, that's one of the things I brought up. I also brought up the absence of direct discrimination, the absence of oddly shaped districts, the lack of -- I mean the great volume of political evidence, and throw in another one, anything that all of that has been done, it is alleged on racial basis, to change the population in the district of the desired voters by 1.3 percent?

      "Neil Gorsuch: I -- I get that, and I'm wondering why. I mean, normally, if a plaintiff bears a burden of proof, you have to show that it would have happened but for, you know, this change in the world. And I think the -- here, the analogy would be -- and I'm just exploring this. I don't know. All right? I could be wrong. Probably am. But, in a but-for world, the legislature could have achieved its partisan purposes, nefarious, happy, whatever you think they are, in some other way without -- without doing what it did that you're objecting to. And, here, there's no -- no evidence that the legislature could have achieved its partisan tilt, which everyone says is permissible, in any other way.\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch: What do we do with that when -- when -- with the presumption of good faith?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch: No, I'm not even asking about -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm really not interested in whether it's a requirement or not. I'm just -- just as a factual matter, wouldn't it have been the simplest thing to do? If I'm plaintiff and I want to show the defendant can achieve its permissible ends in some other way, I think, in most other scenarios, in a tort case or an antitrust case, is what I'm thinking about, I would show that there were 15 other ways to achieve that which you said you wanted to achieve. And that would -- that would be really strong probative evidence -- whether it's required or not, put -- put that aside -- that, hey, you're not telling the truth about what you were up to here.\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: That's the point, isn't it? There were maps that remained Republican-leaning that were rejected, and, instead, there was this unusual movement in and out based on race. That's what the experts showed, that you can't explain the movements based on partisanship, that they can only be explained on the basis of race. That's the burden the plaintiff meets, correct?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: I had this question as I was going through: If you can't get to where you want to go without using race, do you think our law permits that?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: That's the whole point, isn't it? If you can't reach a goal, no matter how laudatory it is, if the only way that you can satisfy yourself for whatever your political reasons are is by using race, that's illegal.\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: So the bottom line is they had maps that were created that reached -- that kept them Republican-leaning and they chose not to use them. For whatever other political reasons, what they went back to was race to make the map they made, correct?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas: This is just a matter of curiosity. If you can't -- your answer was you couldn't use race to draw the districts, right?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas: But you used -- you can use race to draw a majority/minority district?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas: Outside of this context, do we use the predominant standard in -- in our Fourteenth Amendment analysis?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Alito? No? Justice -- anything further? Justice Kagan?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: Ms. Flynn, so it's a funny case because it's our first post-Rucho case of this kind. So, before Rucho, right, you could understand completely why it was that map-makers started doing race in order to achieve partisan gerrymanders, because they couldn't do partisan gerrymanders directly. They were afraid that that was going to be found unlawful. But now that Rucho has come about and -- and all these partisan gerrymandering claims have been held to be non-justiciable, you know, some people might sort of say, well, I don't get it. Like, why do people keep using race when they can just do it directly? Just do -- use the election data, do the partisan gerrymandering. You know, doesn't the fact that they can do it directly suggest that they're not -- why would you need race as a proxy? So that's my question to you. Why would map-makers in general and in this case use race as a proxy to do partisan gerrymandering now that you could just, like, do partisan gerrymandering?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch: Your brief also makes the point that it would have been plausible for the district court to have come to the exact opposite conclusion it came to here and that it would have been just as plausible for them to find, as Justice Kagan alluded to, that the simplest explanation was they wanted to do politics and they did politics. How does that -- how should we think about that under our clear error standard?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch: And how does that fit with the presumption of good faith that we -- because we're reviewing state legislative actions here, that we ask people, lower courts, to make sure that they're -- they're not overstepping their bounds and -- and getting too involved in state and local politics?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: Just to follow up on Justice Gorsuch's question, how would a district court look at this exact same evidentiary record and come to the opposite conclusion in your view?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: But you've looked at this record and you obviously concluded that the district court could have said no, that expert evidence is not sufficiently reliable or probative in light of the overall record to support the plaintiffs' case?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: To -- to pick up on Justice Kagan's question and I think a big theme of the other side's briefing is, why would we do this when we have the political data? Justice Kagan mentioned that. And that's all over the briefs and the amicus briefs on their side. And then I think the main response is the political data is not good enough to achieve the end they want to achieve of a greater Republican tilt. Do you agree with that?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: Right. What if we disagree on that point about the strength of the political data? I think an earlier question Justice Kagan mentioned that that asked about the reliability of that data or how probative that data is. Suppose we think that data is fairly probative. Does the whole case that -- that plaintiffs had, the district court's conclusion then all fall because that's really the linchpin of the response to the main argument that the state's giving, which is we relied on this political data, the response is that political data is no good, so you couldn't have been. If that data is good, should we reverse?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: Why do you think 2020 presidential election data is not reliable, probative, or whatever term you want to use there, or sufficiently reliable or probative that it would have made sense to rely on that?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: Would you think looking at 2020 and figuring out were you a Trump voter or were you a Biden voter is not probative to whether you're going to vote for Nancy Mace or not in the next election?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: So I think the difficult thing about this case is that clear error review, we owe a lot of deference to the district court's findings. But we're also reviewing it in light of the legal standards, and I'm not -- I'm talking about factual, I'm not talking about the arguments that there was legal error here, but we're reviewing it in light of the fact that the plaintiffs bear an exceedingly heavy burden when they're trying to disentangle race and politics and that we give the legislature a presumption of good faith. So we're asking whether the district court made a clear error in light of the fact that it was judging the factual record with those things into account. And the Chief Justice has outlined, you know, kind of the sum I think in a -- in a pretty concise way of the evidence which was all circumstantial here. I think there's a reason why Dr. Ragusa's report keeps coming up, is because it was the best of the expert reports that actually did try to disentangle race and politics, which was the key question here. And you pointed out, and -- and so did -- so did the Respondent, that they didn't point out an alternative map, but they had expert evidence that was just as good because it made similar points. But this is my question about Dr. Ragusa's evidence. Did it control for factors like contiguousness and compactness? Because Respondent pointed out in trying to address this problem, which I think is why, you know, that we've all been asking about and struggling with, that, you know, Respondents said, well, some of the experts testified about traditional districting criteria and some testified about attempts to disentangle race and politics, and they were all showing different things, but did anybody consider all of them? Because it seems to me like that would be really relevant evidence. And I want to be sure that I'm understanding Dr. Ragusa's testimony and its assumptions accurately. So what's -- what's your view on that?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: And last question: How do you think we should think about clear error review in the kind of situation that I outlined where the plaintiffs' burden was so heavy below because of the good-faith standard and because of the heavy burden that a plaintiff bears in trying to disentangle race and politics? How do you think that should affect our review of the facts?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: Yeah, I just wanted to ask about the question that Justice Kavanaugh asked with respect to our own assessment of the presidential election data and whether or not it's reliable. Is that a finding of fact or that we would owe sort of clear error review deference to the district court's determination, or is that something we are apt to or allowed to take into account ourselves?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: So, in other words, are we looking at a de novo? So what -- what result from the fact that we might disagree about the fact that the district -- about the reliability of the presidential election? Do we owe the district court deference with respect to their determination that having that data, you know, was -- was not enough and that race was actually at issue here? Do we owe them any deference with respect to that?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: Okay. And -- and with respect to this question about maps and alternative map, I'm just wondering whether or not an alternative map is helpful with respect to the contention that the district was being oddly manufactured with respect to who was being moved in or out. This is similar to the question that I asked plaintiffs' counsel. My understanding is that politics is driving it at a sort of meta level, and the map-maker identifies a Republican-leaning district that he would like to include. That Republican-leaning district has both white and Black voters in it. And so one would assume that just by that move, the BVAP goes up. I don't know if that's right, but I'm just -- I'm walk -- I'm walking it through. But, in this situation, the BVAP stays the same at the end of the day and we have evidence that the map-maker went into the rest of the district and moved out a certain number of Democratic-leaning voters who happened to be Black or plaintiffs say because they were Black, but that's what makes the BVAP remain the same. It's that we've now moved out Black Democrats to account for, I guess, the Republican-leaning district that we have included. Is the use of race in that way, you know, I have now got a higher BVAP than I want, and I'm moving out Black voters, not white Democrats, Black Democrats, in order to bring the BVAP down, is that a violation in -- in this world?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: And what would a map do? If that's the kind of violation that I am trying to establish as the plaintiff, I guess what I don't understand is why having an alternative map is going to illuminate that in any way.\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson: So the government's position is that you don't necessarily have to have a map and you don't necessarily have to have direct evidence. We've been hearing a lot about the lack of direct evidence in this case. Is there a world in which you can put together a case that demonstrates that race is actually operative in this environment without direct evidence and without a map?\n",

      "Anthony M. Kennedy: But you're willing to make your case here rise or fall on the... whether or not triple damages can be granted to a government after a criminal prosecution?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Mr. Roberts, isn't there another difference too on the triple damages setting? The triple damages are paid to a private third party, but when the United States recovers damages after a conviction, they only get single damages, don't they?\n",
      "Sandra Day O'Connor: Doesn't this statute permit private suits for recovery?\n",
      "Sandra Day O'Connor: And so what happens if a private person were here instead of the government seeking triple the penalty?\n",
      "Sandra Day O'Connor: It's rather odd to apply a double jeopardy analysis if... if the suit is brought by a private person, isn't it?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: That's the... the argument I think in the... in the Browning-Ferris case, yes, which depending on how it comes out, would make... could lead to a curious result here. If the... the Eighth Amendment doesn't apply at all to civil proceedings, then there's not even that limit on the extent of the civil punishment the government can impose. And if it does apply in the civil proceeding, then the government presumably would say that this isn't punishment until it becomes excessive punishment, which would be an odd result. There is no natural cutoff. My brother today mentioned that there will come a point at which the recovery may be so excessive, but there's no logical way to draw that point other than the... the line that was drawn in Hess and in Rex Trailer when the amount exceeds the remedial purpose. When it's no longer compensatory, then it is a second punishment. And the fact that it's imposed in a civil forum makes no difference for the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause. It makes no difference to the defendant whether this $130,000 penalty, the second punishment, is called criminal or civil because he has already been criminally convicted of the underlying offense. The government refers to the greater stigma, the moral condemnation, that attaches to a criminal punishment. But that argument simply doesn't work in this case. The issue is not whether Halper is going to be stigmatized or morally condemned. We know the answer to that. He is for precisely these same false claims. The issue is how many different times the government can punish him as a result of that moral condemnation, and the answer in the Double Jeopardy Clause is once. The government's focus on the distinction between criminal and civil is... is misdirected. Under the Double Jeopardy Clause, as this Court has frequently noted, there are three distinct protections: protects against a second prosecution after an acquittal, protects against a second prosecution after a conviction, and it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense. Now, when the first two of those protections are at issue, you need to know if it's a prosecution. Is this an inherently criminal proceeding? But when the third protection is at issue, you simply need to know if it's a multiple punishment, if he's being punished a second time. Finally, the government argues for reversal with a parade of... of horribles, all these routine civil sanctions after a conviction that will supposedly go out the door if the judgment is affirmed. For example, it cites in its reply brief debarment from further government contracting, loss of a professional license, disbarment. The decision below will not at all threaten those routine sanctions. In each case, those sanctions can be justified with reference to a remedial objective: in the case of debarment, maintaining the integrity of the government contracting programs; in the case of disbarment, maintaining public confidence in the integrity of the bar. Here there is no remedial justification for the $130,000 penalty. It is punishment pure and simple. Finally, the decision below will not upset the government's efforts to stamp out false claims. It can bring a criminal action and get what are now very high fines, up to $250,000 per count, and then later bring a civil proceeding in which the defendant is collaterally estopped to collect all its damages, all its costs. Or it can bring the civil proceeding separately. I don't think anything in the holding below means that the government cannot collect this penalty in a civil proceeding. It just means if he has already been punished, this is punishment and can't be brought--\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: It would also mean that the civil proceeding wouldn't be a civil proceeding, wouldn't it, that you have to have a reasonable doubt standard and all the safeguards that apply in a criminal trial?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: --But... but only because he has been convicted criminally already, it's bad here. Had he not been... had there not been any criminal offense involved, the government could have... could have assessed this civil penalty without any problem. Is that right?\n",
      "Byron R. White: I didn't... I didn't want to... what would be your answer? Would they... would there--\n",

      "William H. Rehnquist: In other words, any civil plaintiff who obtains punitive damages from a court is perhaps violating the Double Jeopardy Clause?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Isn't there another factor in the... in the qui tam action and in the treble damage antitrust actions that the extra recovery is partially justified as an incentive for the third private party to bring the action? So, it's not strictly compensatory, but yet it... it pays for getting something done by getting the third party activated in the matter.\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: But what is the maximum criminal fine you could recover?\n",

      "Antonin Scalia: General Starr, what if Congress decided to apportion it roughly, for the most part according to population, but put an upper limit? Congress says, you know, California is getting awfully big, and we think just as there's a minimum limit there ought to be a maximum limit too. What if it did that? Could we review that?\n",

      "John Paul Stevens: Mr. Starr, can I ask you a question about the methods as a group? Is it true that for all of them, focusing on the fractional remainder point that you say, like California has, what is it, 52 and 1/8 is--\n",

      "William H. Rehnquist: But don't you agree that the situation of the intrastate redistricting even for Congress is quite dramatically different than the situation of assigning representatives to 50 different states?\n",

      "John Paul Stevens: May I ask just at this point, is it part of your submission that the Hill method is always distorted against a smaller state?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: But the bias under that method will not necessarily be against a smaller state, or do you contend it is?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: It could have been against Massachusetts or New York or any one of the other states?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: The larger the state... you cannot have the proportion of swing with a state that is very numerous in population, has a lot of districts. One more or less district is not going to make the difference between 500 and 800 per representative. Isn't the swing going to be a lot more with a small state?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: May I ask you one other question when you're talking about these big percentages? Supposing we took in a new state, like Guam, which is very much smaller than all the other states. Inevitably the percentage distortion would be much greater. Say there were only 100,000 people in the state, so they would get one representative when the ideal is 572,000. So isn't there always a potential for even more dramatic distortion than you describe?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: How can you possibly ascribe that overriding objective? You're saying this pushes aside everything else, all other considerations which some of these other methods take into account. You say this is a categorical consideration. How can you attribute that to a system which says no matter what, if we figure it all out and you don't even get one representative, we're still going to give you one? I mean, isn't this a system that has not adopted that principle? It has not adopted the one man, one vote principle as an overriding consideration.\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: No, but I'm asking you how do you explain, how you reconcile with your position the fact that the Constitution itself provides for one representative even if you're not entitled to one on the basis of one person, one vote?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: I presume that under this Constitution the House could provide for only 50 members. I mean, suppose the House says we want to become more prestigious than the Senate. [Laughter] We will have only 50 members. Each state would have one representative, wouldn't it?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: May I be sure I understand your submission? Are you contending the Dean method is constitutionally compelled?\n",

If another one should be, someone should think up one that's even more equitable according to your submission, would that then become constitutionally compelled?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Okay. And what about your reference to a system that's easily understood? Is there any virtue in the most easily understood method?\n",

And you can say, well, burglary... burglary and arson, if you're apprehended, you're the career criminal; you commit these kinds of crimes. Congress doesn't want you to have a gun, or if you do, you're going to get the book thrown at you. But there doesn't seem to be much of a connection. I mean how... how is it going to make the dangerous... the drunk driver more or less dangerous if he happens to have a gun in the glove compartment?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Then they could have turned it just on dangerousness. I'm back to Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg's question, and I'm simply sort of repeating those in a sense that make it quite specific. Imagine a universe of crimes. Every member of that universe we concede has precisely the same degree of danger as arson, explosives, burglary. So there's no argument about the risk to human life. It is identical. And now we write a statute, and the statute's object is to take people who are felons in possession of a gun and those persons whom it is particularly bad that they have a gun are going to go away for 15 years minimum. So what we're looking are people who are particularly bad that they have a gun. Now go back to our universe, and in that universe we have some things on the one hand like arson, but on the other hand... I have to name a few, environmental crimes committed by negligence or recklessness, where somebody flushed a toxic substance down the drain or... here's a good one I found... if you are a steamboat captain or an executive of a steamboat company and you fail through negligence or simple inadvertence to stop somebody from not inspecting a lifeboat, well, felony or worse. And there are quite a few dozens of these things: Failing to stop at an inspection station if you are a trucker. You know? There are quite a few, where what's at issue is negligence, thoughtlessness, and maybe even recklessness, but it seems to have nothing... and it's dangerous... but has nothing to do with whether, when later on you want a gun, you are a greater risk for having a gun, you're more likely to pull the trigger, you're more likely to aim it at somebody and shoot him. Now, that's I think what we are trying to drive at.\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: How much of a limitation is the point Justice Breyer was making? I mean, let's say you've got a habitual drunk driver. Everybody in town says he always drives drunk.

      "John Paul Stevens: Isn't the significance of Justice Breyer's point that each of the listed crimes is more dangerous when a criminal is carrying a gun, but driving drunk isn't made any more dangerous whether or not there's a gun in the car?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Is a person who deliberately burns down buildings, is a person who if he had a gun might pull the trigger? And I will suggest that's a reasonable inference. I also will give you this: That a person who's so careless as to go drunk driving is a person whose gun might go off carelessly or he might leave it around the house. So I'll give you that one. But my instinct is that Congress, in this Act, is not worried about guns going off carelessly around the house. They are worried about a person being the kind of person who will point a gun at somebody and pull the trigger. Now, is there something you can say that disabuses me of that instinct?\n",

      "John M. Harlan II: Yeah, but the Court, the Florida Court as I read its opinion said, you cannot raise your Constitutional objections to this because you have no standing in light of your allegation with your complaint?\n",

This Court has said again and again that if a particular individual himself, a particular individual himself could not be affected by a statute, he can claim injury on behalf of others who might be in the same class, but were not excluded by the record filed. I think of the case in 204 U.S. I think of a lot of cases to which this Court has said (Inaudible) if somebody who is hurt by this. I think the ground as you -- as you put it that he represents the class. He doesn't represent a class if he is in a class by himself. Why does he put that into his pleading?

Would you see a difference between that and the oath you would take that would be required if it said that I will not discriminate on account of race, color or religion, one being a statement of what he believed and one being a statement of what he would do, is that the line you're drawing?\n",

That's a very different thing from saying that a man who is charged with a duty shouldn't be expected while legislation is written. We have a number of enactments of Congress, the PVA I believe is one, Justice Black will correct me, but I think that's one if the person to be appointed by the President should be a man who has faith and conviction in the particular enterprise and therefore as an extra energetic impulse to carry out that enterprise, isn't that true?

That is, Congress wanted these trades to be reported and to have this form filed, Form 4 filed. So it's a -- it's a disclosure-forcing provision, 16(a) is.

Maybe 50 years later, all right. If you take the opposite position, then you will prevent plaintiffs in borderline cases from bringing suits because they aren't going to find out if somebody thinks it's a borderline case.

And you want to say no, it doesn't begin to run from that point, it begins to run from the point when some other completely different external event occurs, if it ever does occur, which is the filing of the 16a report. Texturally, how do you get to that?\n",

Right?\n",
      "Sandra Day O'Connor: Now, at the so-called end of the plaintiff's case, even if this other evidence may emerge that, well, there was some animosity here, even though it isn't a mandatory presumption at that stage, there still are inferences to be drawn, are there not, from the plaintiff's evidence that he was fired, that he was qualified, that someone of another race was hired instead?\n",
      "Sandra Day O'Connor: So, I mean, how would he ever be entitled to summary judgment even though some other evidence had emerged? I mean, it still is a fact question to be determined by the trier of fact.\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Mr. Gardner, what is the effect of the prima facie case? I mean, maybe we could avoid the dilemma that the other side says exists if the effect of the prima facie case is not to entitle the employee to judgment if there's no response from the employer, no other reason given, but rather just to entitle the employee to get to the factfinder. In other words, it survives your motion to dismiss, but the fact... which means the factfinder may find in favor of the employee, but perhaps the prima facie case does not mean that the factfinder must find in favor of the employee.\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Well, I understand that, but we wouldn't be faced with this dilemma, would we?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: It seems to me there's an undercurrent in this case that the employer is not bound by what it says. It's really a rather unremarkable principle to say that a party is bound by his own proof, isn't it? Aren't we departing from that somewhat in this case?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: How can you call it a failure of proof if what you're really saying is that there was a third reason, not the racial reason, not the defendant's reason, but this antagonism? Is that a failure of proof, or is that a finding of an affirmative explanation?\n",

      "David H. Souter: Is the alternative then necessarily that what you're asking us to do is to hold that the reasons given by the employer, once the burden of going forward shifts, need not be ultimately the exclusive reasons that he relies upon to defend the case? In other words, you're... it seems to me you're necessarily saying that there should not be a requirement for the employer to raise all possible defenses that he intends to rely on at that time. Is that a fair statement of your position?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Well, why do you split them up? I mean, you're not simply saying that the employer ought to have the possibility of a wild card in the form of a factfinder who says, well, I think in this instance I'll go beyond the reasons given. You're saying that's a legitimate thing to do, and if it's a legitimate thing to do, then I can't think of any reason why the employer shouldn't be able to argue it. He says, look, I gave you two reasons, purely pretextual, but I've got some more evidence, and if you're going to find against me on these two stated reasons as pretextual, let me throw in the rest of the evidence and you may find that I've got a third good reason that I haven't mentioned yet. You're saying that that's legitimate.\n",
      "David H. Souter: Yes, but if that's the case, then why don't we go right back to the point that I guess Justice Scalia made and say the real error in this case is that there was never a prima facie case made?\n",
      "David H. Souter: And if we look at it that way, what have we got here in this case? Just a matter of error correction I guess. The district court's error was in failing to see the plaintiff's failure in the first instance.\n",

      "Byron R. White: You... what do you object in the court... to in the court of appeals judgment? Namely, that the district court was... it was improper for him, for the district court judge, to rule for the plaintiff just because there was a finding of pretext.\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: How is it if there's a third explanation that was so obvious to the judge that the defendant never mentioned it? It's kind of counter-intuitive.\n",
      "David H. Souter: And what's your... what's-- --Of course. The plaintiff thought it was racial. I'm sorry. I was going to say and what's the justification. Coming back to kind of the other alternative analysis, what's the justification for allowing the defendant to profit by this if he never raises it as a defense? It's sitting right there in front of him. He never mentions it. Why... as a matter of just sensible procedure, why allow him to take advantage of that?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Well, that may very well be. I'm just raising simply a procedural point. Let's get our issues defined, and the way to define our issues is to require the defendant, when it's... when the burden shifts to the defendant, to give all the reasons that he may rely on. And if he chooses to omit one, particularly one which you claim here was disclosed by the plaintiff's case, why in effect should he be allowed to do that? Why not simply adopt a rule that says we want to know what the defenses are going to be, defining the issues before us at least at the point at which the burden shifts to the defendant. If he does not give that reason, too bad. He can't rely on it.\n",
      "David H. Souter: Look, the factfinder is not an independent party here. If a defendant... a factfinder is straitjacketed when somebody doesn't raise a defense, let's not cry for the factfinder. Why as a matter of just sensible procedure do we not require that the defenses be raised and that the person who raises them be limited to them?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: The thing that concerns me, Mr. Gardner, is what does the plaintiff do on rebuttal. He looks at the two defenses or three defenses. Well, I've blown those out of the water. I better search the record for any possible other reason that might occur to the judge, and I better cover the waterfront with all sorts of testimony. Won't you get a lot of collateral issues developed in the rebuttal stage of the case if you have to cover every conceivable reason for discharge even if not relied on by the defendant?\n",

      "Byron R. White: And do you think that... don't judges sometimes rule on the motion although they think we really are going to... we really don't think it's much of a prima facie case, and we may ultimately decide the case because the plaintiff's case was deficient?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: Well, isn't there something to what Mr. Gardner was saying about the way a trial proceeds, that you don't say now we're going to call three witnesses to make out our prima facie case? You put on a witness. You find out as much as you can from him on both sides. Then you go on to the next witness, and sometimes you can't be sure at what point the prima racie case has been made out. You know at the end of all the witnesses the plaintiff has called it has.\n",

      "William H. Rehnquist: Well, why should this be different than a negligence case? You know, the plaintiff gets up and testified, you know, I slipped and fell, and there was... it was icy and there was... the employer failed to shovel the walks. Well, again, the plaintiff in that sort of a case can testify in a way that would entitle a jury to find there was no negligence, and we don't say that because it came out of the plaintiff's mouth, it's somehow... the defendant didn't have a fair opportunity to rebut it or the plaintiff didn't have a fair opportunity to rebut it.\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: Yes, but do you think Congress intended that the factfinding process in these cases should be different than the factfinding process in all other sort of civil litigation was?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Well, what if in the course of cross-examining the defendant's witnesses, in order to prove pretext, the... it turns out that there was personal animosity? Do you think just because the defendant... the plaintiff proves pretext by that evidence, that it's entitled to judgment and that the court is disentitled to say, well, it may be pretext, but there really is a neutral reason, a race-neutral reason, for the discharge? Is a court forbidden to do that?\n",

The reporting requirements in 16 (a) apply without difference to an officer, director, and 10% stockholder. That reporting is required the moment one becomes a 10% stockholder or rather within 10 days thereafter.\n",

      "Felix Frankfurter: Well what I'm saying, the one might be more economical to turn the use of oil into coal?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: Exactly. Yes sir. And the terms of this contract are clear, they're definite, they covered every ounce of coal that this Company utilized or could buy at -- to use in its facilities at this time and this is - in short, a full requirements contract. Now let me hasten along if I may here. There wasn't any coal delivered under this contract. This is not a case of partial performance. The seller terminated the contract before the delivery. The action here that has been brought by the petitioner, it is an action for a declaratory judgment as it appears in the record on page 6. The complaint asked for this relief, the complaint asked that this Court declares the contract to be a valid, lawful, and enforceable contract and binding upon the plaintiff and defendants according to its terms. Of course, if the contract is unlawful, I should think it would follow that the Court cannot enter a judgment to the effect that it is valid, lawful, and enforceable, and is binding upon the plaintiff and defendants according to its terms. Actually, what petitioner is seeking here is an order from this Court to the defendants to compel the defendants for 20 years to perform a contract which in our contention is unlawful and if I may anticipate myself a little bit here, the interest the -- Mr. Chanler made a very interesting statement at the conclusion of his argument. He said that the buyer, namely, petitioner could compel the seller to perform, but that the seller could not compel the buyer to perform. I know of no such contract and no such decree that can be entered into our system of law. Now I'll come to that in more detail in a moment I hope. Now, let me get to, quickly get to the amounts covered by this contract. The amounts are set forth, the actual amount is set forth in the replacement contract, the Levin Ames contract to which I refer a moment ago and they're set out on page 27. They begin with 350,000 tons in 1958. They rise from one million tons in 1961 and then to increase as required to about 2,250,000 tons per year. Now, what -- in dollar terms what does that mean? In dollar terms, let's take the one million tons figure from 1961. Under the minimum specified in this contract that means $6,400,000 a year and a $128,000,000 over the 20 years of the contract. Of course it's greatly more to use as your base not the one million tons but the 2,250,000 tons. Now, as the court below found and as petitioner admits just taking the 700,000 thousand tons, if you please, embraced by this contract for the year 1960 that is equal to the total amount of coal used and sold in all of Peninsula, Florida in the year 1959 which was also 700,000 tons. Petitioner concedes and the courts below so found that within a few years, the Gannon Station covered by this contract will consume more coal than it is presently consuming in the entire State of Florida. Let's take another measure here. In terms of fuel equivalent, the coal requirements for the Gannon Station exceed all of the oil burned in petitioners other plants. Now, I'm just taking this in terms of energy equivalence. Now, so that our point which I hope I'll have time to elaborate in a moment, if Your Honors please, with respect to the amounts engrossed by this contract is that this contract engrosses so much coal that its competitive effect is so great that whether you take the minority of the majority opinions of this Court or take any standards that anybody has ever referred to, this contract meets the qualifying clause of Section 3 of the Clayton Act. In the first place, if you take the amounts standing by themselves they are certainly substantial. They are huge. This contract engrosses a huge amount of coal. If you take the amount and compare it on any reasonable market basis, this contract is huge and embraces a large share of the market. I am sorry to -- but perhaps I'd rather take time to comment upon Mr. Chanler's suggestion about what the market ought to be. Mr. Chanler says that you ought to take us some market, the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic coast. Why? Because he says that Florida might draw upon producers, 700 of them according to this record who supply -- who supply in the area from the Rocky Mountain to the Atlantic Coast. As a matter of fact, those producers also sell coal in foreign countries but obviously, that is not the market. The market is the consumer market. Let us take this kind of a situation quickly to illustrate the point. Let's suppose that general motors came into the District of Columbia or in the New York City and made a contract in restrain of trade or a price fixing agreement in one of those areas. Now, what is the market? First thing we are lawyers doing antitrust basis and say, what is the market in the section of one case. What's a market? Oh, the market is the District of Columbia or the market's New York City. The market certainly is -- is not every place in the world where General Motor sells cars. If that was so General Motors could pick out the District of Columbia and monopolize that and Ford could monopolize some other place and so on. The market is the consuming market. Let me put it more precisely as --\n",
      "Earl Warren: Mr. Fortas, I've been wondering if that proportion of the coal under this contract to the total amount in use in part is of any great value to us because the situation in my own state we use practically no coal out there. And they -- if one small utility was to set up a unit, a coal unit out there it would probably -- it could be more than the whole State of California uses of coal and would that -- would that make any difference?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: It would mean -- I don't believe so Mr. Chief Justice. Let me approach the problem this way. The standard as establish by the cases in this Court is whether if -- under Section 3 of the Clayton Act is whether the quantity engross by the coun -- contract is not in substantial or not insignificant. Here, it is very substantial. The law under Section 3 as announced by this Court is confined to that standard. Is it a not insignificant or not insubstantial amount? I merely wanted to go a little further in an attempt to impress upon the Court the fact that even if you measure this by a market standard, even if you measure it by Sherman Act standard which you shouldn't do, of course, under your decisions, this is an enormous contract that satisfies the qualifying clause. Now, your question to me is whether the competitor -- whether a contract would still meet the qualifying clause if it were for a new commodity introduced into a particular community. I believe I state that forever. That is precisely one of the considerations considered in the Standard Oil case. Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinion for the Court there and rejected in that case as something that Congress did not have in mind in terms of Section 3, and I think properly so and let me, if I may, elaborate that. Mr. Chief Justice, the easiest thing in the world to do in many commercial situations as every lawyer knows is entered into requirements contracts. The requirements contracts makes everybody feel nice and secured, but what it does is to remove a whole area of our economy from competition pro tanto with the requirements contracts. Now let's take this case. Here, we had not only a requirements contract, we got a requirements contract for 20 years, if you please. Now, the coal industry is a depressed industry. The -- there are 700, according to petitioner's admission, producers of coal who are able and eager to supply this company with coal. There's a very vivid statement by the president of this company that is in the record saying that sellers of coal were in and out of his office so fast, if you please and so many of them, if you please, that his secretary couldn't find any place to let them sit. It's on page 62 of the record. Now, what does this contract mean? This contract means that for 20 years these people have no look in. I suppose every utility company did that, if Your Honors please. About a quarter, one quarter of the bituminous coal in this country is consumed by electric utilities companies. They are large buyers. They are principal buyers. If this Court ever gave its sanction to that kind of a deal, this kind of a preclusive contract, I need not to elaborate on what it would mean to the bituminous coal industry. It would mean instead of having a lot of little coal producers who live by reason of orders from time to time from utility companies, you would necessary have a few big companies. And those few big companies, if you please, would in effect be kept to the consumers. There are many ways of skinning a cat in economic relationships. A utility company does not have to buy a coal mine for example, to get it captive. It can make a long term requirements contract and it is just this sort of thing that the Clayton Act as this Court has pointed out and has so eloquently pointed out in my opinion in the Standard Oil of California is just this sort of thing, that Section 3 of the Clayton Act was intended to reach in its incipiency. Now, Mr. Chanler --\n",
      "Felix Frankfurter: Does that mean when you certainly reach that no requirements contract would be valid?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: I say didn't reach what I'm about to come to, I beg your pardon sir. I was about to say that the 20-year provision coupled with the other provisions in this contract in my opinion, making it also violative of Sherman Act. I don't believe the Court need to reach Sherman Act provision here. There is absolutely when we get to the Sherman Act, of course, we have to look at it in terms of reasonableness in some cases and the tying cases, you'll look at the question of dominance under the Sherman Act but not under the Clayton Act. But you also look at – you may also look at other things bearing upon reasonableness. 20-year contract here was totally -- is totally indefensible as a matter of law. Now, Your Honor, we recall that in the Standard Oil Case, you pointed out that we may assume that the contracts here involved in Standard Oil are not excessive in duration. You remember that great many of them were six-month contracts and with the -- even without that, she went on to the coaling and that leading case, but here, we have a requirements contract, we have it for 20 years. Now what they do when they made a replacement contract? As the record shows a contract with Levin Ames on pages 26 and 27 of the record was cancelled upon 12 months notice. In other words, it was a year-to-year contract. Now, did that take care of its needs? Well, I think the best evidence of that is a statement that Mr. Chanler has in his reply brief and I don't know this goes outside of the record. It's in his reply brief. This sports public utilities fortnightly as saying that as of September 1960 -- as of September 1960, after the lower court opinions in this case that Tampa Electric is thinking about building a new coal station which will begin operations at the end of the 1960, that is to say as around 1970 that would be after this contract has operated along for 13 years. Now what I'm saying, Mr. Justice, with respect to the time factor here, is that if we take this case, the time factor, in this case standing alone makes it clear and beyond dispute that the qualifying clause of Section 3 is satisfied. That is to say, this -- since this ties up commerce for 20 years in most certainly has a tendency to restrain trade or to create monopoly. So we have here two rather staggering facts in my opinion. First is a tremendous volume of the commerce that's tied up, and second, is a practically extraordinary length of time, a 20-year contract.\n",
      "Felix Frankfurter: What we have to (Inaudible) on behalf of page 2, questions, what were the -- any kind of certain requirements under (Inaudible) is the Levin Ames and to living in, what the relevance or the ratio of relevance of the duration of the contract during which assured that there was a requiremnt?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: I've noticed that myself, Mr. Justice, but Mr. Justice, I want to make my position perfectly clear on this. Let's -- in terms of the law as it exists today, established by the cases of this Court, a full requirements contract is unlawful if and only if it made attempts substantially to restrain, create or tend to create a monopoly. To satisfy that so called qualifying clause, the cases in this Court say, in a Section 3 Clayton Act case, you look only to whether the contract involves a substantial or not insubstantial amount of commerce. Now, that is the law of this Court as I understand it and I don't want to be misunderstood if I may say so. I am not -- I -- I believe that's the law I believe in that as the law. I'm saying merely that this contract in the circums in -- that this contract, this record goes far beyond that. Now, I want to quickly to get to some other points from Mr. Chanler's statement. Mr. Chanler's state of four criteria here and I'm always surprise when I hear him say them because they're directly contrary to the rulings of this Court. First, he says that -- first he talked about coal and oil. Coal is a separate line of commerce for purposes of the Clayton Act, for the purposes of Section 3. I've already covered this. It's covered by the decisions of this Court. You cannot measure the extent of the engrossment of this contract by going to oil. Indeed you couldn't -- couldn't even do it for purposes of the Sherman Act case much less to a particular kind of agreement that's here involved. Mr. Chanler likes to refer to cello -- to Cellophane whether -- it's DuPont case the Cellophane case, but it's very significant that even in Cellophane in which was a monopoly case if you please and in -- in which you market concept has to be search very carefully this Court said that you would not take -- you must not take into account for it. You must not assume for its example that wood, coal -- that wood, cement and steal although they're all building materials, all constitute of market said that each one of them has sufficient distinctive characteristics so that you must define the market for each separately. And in the General Motors case, the DuPont-General Motors case, this Court said that automobile paints and fabrics constitute separate and distinct lines of commerce, that was Section 7 of the Clayton Act and that you look to the peculiar characteristics and uses of each. In Van Camp the -- where we have got that brief, what the point is, that certainly oil and coal here are not interchangeable in any sense, not even for Sherman Act purposes. And when you come to the very point prohibitions of Section 3, they are certainly distinct of lines of commerce, but I want to get Mr. Chanler's second point. Mr. Chanler wants this Court to rule that this -- a contract does not violate Section 3 unless the seller has economic leverage sufficient to impose the condition. Now I thought that was all settled. It's very interesting, Mr. Chanler in his principal brief here for the petitioner didn't mention Times-Picayune although we have briefed it below, it came rather toward only in his reply brief. But in Times-picayune, this Court very, which was a Sherman Act case, this Court very carefully delineated the distinction in this respect between the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, and I want to quote Mr. Justice Black's opinion for the Court. From the tying cases, perceptible pattern emerges. Under the Clayton Act if the seller enjoys a monopolistic position in the market for the tying product, or, and that is underlined in the opinion, or a substantial volume of commerce in the tied product is restrained, the arrangement violates the narrower standards of Section 3. But under the Sherman Act, both conditions must exist. That is the statement of the law as it's been established and as it's been followed. Under the Sherman Act, dominance or monopoly power by the seller is quite unnecessary. The reason for that as pointed out in the Standard Oil is that Section 3 of the Sherman Act is -- of the Clayton Act, Section 3 of the Clayton Act is a highly particularized, specific prohibition against contracts that exclude a competitor or competitors of the seller from any line of commerce. Under the Sherman Act, all we look to is a general statement, general condemnation of contracts in restrain of trade and a general condemnation of contracts in restrain of trade must be viewed from the point-of-view of the rule of reason. It maybe under the Sherman Act that the mere fact that the seller's dominance and the mere fact that a tying contract was entered into is enough per se to show that the contract was unreasonable, but you must show the purposes of the Sherman Act that contract was unreasonable. For the Clayton Act, that is not so as was exhaustibly analyzed in Standard Oil. For purposes of Section 3 of the Clayton Act, you must show only two things. One, that what is involved is a contract on the condition understanding or with the effect of foreclosing a competitor or competitors of the oil, and number two, you must show only that the effect of the arrangement may be, may be substantial to restrain commerce or to tend to create a monopoly. So Mr. Chanler's point in affect that the seller must have economic dominance or economic leverage or no matter what choice of words he may select is completely in opposition to the holdings of this Court. Now let's get to the next one. Mr. Chanler says that this is the first case under Section 3 of the Clayton Act involving a single contract between a single consumer, a single buyer and a single seller. That is true. This Court has never had such case before it but it reminds me a bill of the distinction on the basis of the red-haired man with the squint on his left eye. All the principles announced by this Court cover this case and as a matter of fact, all we need to do is to look at the statute. If the Court will kindly turn to page two of our brief, this grey brief, we have set forth the statute and I'm sure the Court is familiar with it but I want to call the attention of a few particulars in the statute. It should be unlawful for any person to lease or make a sale or contract for sale or use consumption or a resale on the condition agreement or understanding that the lessee or purchaser, note the single bearer shall not use or deal in the goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, commodities etcetera of a competitor or competitors. In this, there's no question. But that that language includes a single contract was intended to include a single contract and if anyone chooses to enter the maze of legislative history here despite the Court's -- this Court's admonition of the contrary in the Standard Fashions case, I am sure he must conclude that the Congress intended to reach a contract in a town as Mr. Justice Frankfurter has pointed out in the Standard Oil and as is shown in the legislative history. In the good year of 1914, good in some respects, the Congress was very much concerned about antitrust. It was very much concerned about monopoly. It was very much dissatisfied with what had happened under the Sherman Act and Section 3 along with the other particular Sections of the Clayton Act were written for the purpose of catching up these situations in their incipiency. I, myself don't see how anybody can read the legislative history of the Clayton Act without being bewildered in particular by being -- being certain in general that the Congress intended to leave no loopholes not to write. Congress did not write Section 3 for the purpose of providing an escape on the basis of a single contract with a -- between a single buyer and a seller, but that it intended to cover all such contracts. Let me take this for as an illustration. Let's suppose Mr. Chanler in his remarks I believe before lunch referred to Sears Roebuck and A&P. Now let's take that. Let us suppose, if you please, that Sears Roebuck, one enterprise, a largest retailer by far in this country, let us suppose that Sears Roebuck entered into a contract with a single textile company for all of the white goods as they call in that business, cover sheets and so on, all that Sears Roebuck needed and entered into that contract for a 20-year period. Now the textile industry is in a bad way too and there'd be thousands of textile producers, hundreds of them I should say, who would be excluded for any chance at Sears Roebucks business for 20 years but that's a contract, a single contract if you please, a -- between a single seller and a single buyer. Can there be any doubt that that would be prohibited by Section 3 or let's take Du Point General Motors and if I may, let -- if I'll ask you to assume for me the absence of any stab (ph) connection between them from any ownership or start between the two. And let us suppose that general -- that Du Point and General Motors entered into a contract for automobile fabrics and paint for 20 years which would preclude all competitors who might want to sell automobile fabrics and paint. Can there be any doubt that that would be caught by the provisions of Section 3? So I say that number one, this Court has precluded the argument that any dominance by the seller is needed. Number two, that this -- that the statute in all reason show that a sing -- that it makes no difference whether we're dealing with a single contract or many contracts, a single buyer or many buyers. The important -- two important questions are - first, is this a requirements contract in the sense that it excludes a competitor, a competitor or competitors of the seller and second, does it have a prescribed effect on competition. Now finally and I will quit --\n",
      "John M. Harlan II: Could I ask you what wrong does your argument lead for requirement contracts under Section 3? Aren't they all caught in a substantial way?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: I would not think so Mr. Justice. In actual practice, of course we try to avoid the requirements contracts in the sense that the -- we -- the law as I have understood it has always meant that you've got to leave room for competition to come in. And for example, even if we have -- even if we want to get somebody to build a new plant to supply something for us, we take care of the financial requirements there by an agreement to amortize the cost to the plant but we will not enter into a requirements contract because the requirements contract is unlawful. Now I don't believe that that -- that the lack of necessity of the requirements contract means that they should all be outlawed. It is possible that there are requirements contracts which do not run afoul of the qualifying clause that is to say that in the sense that they are not so large in the particular circumstances as to meet the standards of the qualifying clause. On the whole, I would say that requirements contracts are an instrument and by their nature are suspect under the antitrust law. May I suggest this, Mr. Justice? I know that this Court has said -- has said some harsh things about tying agreements in which a patented product is tied in with an unpatented and so on. A requirements contract actually may have and generally does have a much more serious effect on competition than the typical tying contracts. Let's take for example, International Salt or let's take the Signaled Steel which is Court of Appeals case. It's always possible in a tying situation for a -- for the dealer, the licensee to get another machine from somebody else or I don't say it's always possible but sometimes possible, get a machine from somebody else and get out of the tying contract that way and then use a competitor's supplies for -- for the competitor's machine. But a requirements contract is total complete and absolute that no -- there's no way of getting out of that. You can't turn through a competitor but -- so I wanted -- want just one sum up on this. Number one, I think the requirements contracts as a generality are -- have to be highly restrictive on the trade. They have to lead to captive situations which I -- I don't believe that our --\n",

And 15 years later, Congress has done nothing.

They say that happens all the time... all the time.

It's not an absolute rule. It just says, you know, ordinarily.

I assume that most drug cases do have a suppression hearing. It may be a simple one. It may not take very long, but usually there's a suppression motion. Number 2, on the very premises of your argument, if you have to justify the failure to knock and announce, you're going to be able to do it, I would assume, without too much trouble. In fact, I assume you could do it with virtually no trouble in most cases. There will occasionally be a rare case in which, for example, the informant has told you there are no guns, the marijuana is stored in bales out in the barn so that there's no risk of destruction, and in those rare cases you wouldn't be able to justify the failure to knock and announce, but in most of them you could. So are we talking really about the need for anything more than dispensing with what is probably in most cases almost a formality in the proof that you will adduce, the evidence that you will adduce at the suppression hearing?\n",
      "David H. Souter: --Well, let's assume this Court says, look, we are perfectly willing to recognize that in most cases involving drug dealers the State will in fact have valid grounds for dispensing with knock-and-announce, because the marijuana won't be in the barn and the informant will not have said, these people are unarmed. So that we said, we recognize that in most cases they'll be able to make their proof without great difficulty, but we're not going to adopt a blanket rule for the simple reason that if we do we're going to be starting down the road to more blanket exceptions, and more blanket exceptions after that. So that in order to preserve the particularized inquiry value, which is a real value in the long run, we're still going to require the State in effect to make its proof knowing perfectly well that the State can do it in most cases. Now, that, I take it, would be a fairly benign atmosphere for you to present your proof in individual cases. Assuming we said something like that, are we then in this case arguing about anything much more than a formality?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: Well, wouldn't part of it be who had the burden of proof in those hearings? I mean, if the State had the burden of proof at the suppression that it didn't know anything more, it's very hard to prove a negative.\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: General Doyle, there are two questions that I have with respect to your argument about how complicated this will be. One is, what do we do about Wilson, where it was a drug case, and where the police knew in advance that she was armed? Was that just an idle exercise? And the second question is, in this very case there was one justice on the Wisconsin supreme court who said, I think that no-knock is generally required, but it's obvious that in this case it could be dispensed with, so it didn't seem like it's a very complicated exercise if you apply the rule, and if you don't apply the rule, aren't we just gutting what we said a couple of years ago?\n",

It was the kind of a crime that attracted the mob, and there were machine guns and a lot of violence. I expect you wouldn't say the same thing about it today. Now, if we're going to adopt a constitutional rule, does this constitutional rule change as the... you know, as the proclivities of criminals change? Why not just leave it the general rule that where you have cause to believe that you'll be endangered, or that drugs... or what you're searching for will be destroyed, you can enter without knocking, and as things now are that would work out that in 99 percent of the drug cases you'll be able to do it.

Kennedy: I'm curious to know, if the magistrate makes the determination that you must knock, directs the officer to knock as part of the warrant, and the officers see something that they think overrides the judgment, and they don't knock, that does not necessarily invalidate the search, does it?\n",

In the first case, after the jury returns a guilty verdict they also return -- or together with that they answer a special interrogatory and they say the loss exceeded $10,000. In the second case, the defendant pleads guilty and admits during the plea colloquy that the amount is more than $10,000. Would there be a problem in those cases?\n",

So it seems to me that you've got to go the whole hog or you get nothing, and the whole hog is that it's got to be an element of the offense that the loss exceed $10,000. Am I wrong?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Well, yeah, you would prevail, but you would prevail, it seems to me, at the expense of this objection, and the government makes it. There are very, very few fraud and deceit statutes that define the offense by reference to a loss in excess of $10,000. My recollection from the government's brief is that they come up with three. The fact is also that this provision, the $10,000 figure, was placed into the statute at a time when Congress was trying to expand the category of deportable, removable offenses, and it would be passing strange in that context to define the offense by reference to a $10,000 figure as an element of the offense which would cut it down, which would cut the compass of the statute down to three offenses. What is your response to that?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But the problem is that there's no pattern to it, The point that Justice Souter made. If we take your position that there are a number of statutes that mention amount, some as an element, some by this, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to when the amount is there and when it isn't, and then you have these unequal results within the Federal system and in the States, so when you think -- would it make any sense for Congress to have drawn the line that way if the State happens to make -- to have the \"in which\" or if it just has fraud and deceit with no amount?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But what you're saying is you're not denying that people who commit the identical theft or deceit or fraud will be treated differently depending on whether the statute under which they're convicted has this \"in which\" clause?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Mr. Moseley, can I get your help on a question I really have difficulty with. It seems to me as I read the text, it is easy to read it in one of two ways: It involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim in fact exceeded $10,000. In that case you would lose. Or it could be read to say involves fraud or deceit in which an element of the crime is that the victim or victims exceeded a loss of $10,000. You would lose under that also because it is not an element of the crime. So you are relying on a modified approach, and under your modified approach what does the statute say?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: --I don't -- I don't understand how you squeeze your -- your modified categorical approach, which seems to be a deus ex machina which is intended to blunt the government's argument that very few statutes would be covered by this. I don't see how you get that out of the word \"convicted\". Are you convicted of an offense involving more than $10,000 if in a separate interrogatory the jury, though it has no obligation in order to find you guilty to say how much you stole, in an interrogatory the jury says, oh, yes, the amount was more than $10,000? Does that cause you to have been convicted of that? You are convicted of what you are charged with. You are convicted of the elements of the offense, not -- not of whatever, whatever the judge chooses to allow the jury to be questioned about.\n",

For any tax -- a person who is charged with tax evasion who goes to trial and is convicted, that person would not be deportable, as I understand it under your reading, because the jury is not asked to determine the amount of the deficiency.\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Did you have any authority for the -- the idea that a trial judge in a criminal case should ask the jury to answer a special interrogatory regarding a question that has no bearing on the conviction, but may have a bearing on the future immigration status of the defendant, which is what you're suggesting should be done in these tax cases?\n",

      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Could I ask you this, does this -- which is not exactly on point to the issue here, but does the government have a theory about how the loss is measured for purposes of this statute? Under the sentencing guidelines, the loss was a very complicated calculation, lots of rules about relevant conduct and lots of cases and different ways of proving loss, and here we just have the statute.\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: What if you have somebody who participates in a -- in a scheme involving $100 million, the total loss is $10,000, but this person had no way of reasonably anticipating that this would be the -- the total amount of the loss, this was a minor participant, and -- where would the -- how would that come out?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Does the judge, when he arrives at the restitution amount, have discretion to say, as to this particular defendant, he was just an accountant with the company that was committing the fraud, he didn't put anything into his own pocket except the salary they paid him, so I'm going to exclude him from the restitution order?\n",

They allege a scheme and say it's a broad -- a broad scheme, but they don't describe the amount. They merely prove two mailings that involved $25 apiece. But the scheme itself, because you proved it in other cases, you have the facts, actually was a big scheme like we have here. Could they rely on that for -- for immigration purposes in a proceeding like this?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: But it didn't describe the dimensions of the scheme. As far as the record shows, it only affected -- it was one scheme that was as large as this one, but the evidence to prove the scheme only required you to prove two or three mailings involving small amounts of money. But then later on you proved before the immigration judge there really was a big scheme, and that's the one he was convicted of. Isn't that enough?\n",

      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Well, that's just -- I think that's kind of begging the question. You assume that those elements, those provisions also don't have to be proved as elements.

Now, suppose you had a prosecution under the obscenity and there were conviction and it was within the scope of the principle as this Court has stated that are permissible to a state but your Supreme Court would to say, “I don't agree within majority of the Supreme Court. We agree with Mr. Justice Douglas that no obscenity law is constitutional” under the federal constitution and with the reverse the conviction on that ground. Are you suggesting that that would be conclusive on the State of Oregon because that was a holding of your Supreme Court it interpreted the federal constitution. Has it thought, it ought to be rather than the way this Court had?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: I noticed that neither you nor your friends have cited the Krivda case, are you familiar with that?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: That's I think perhaps the most recent case which we sent back that was California was it? The California Supreme Court and said please in fact -- we said, please tell us whether you're deciding this case under the federal constitution or under your own? There have been several of those if they decided and under their own constitution that's the end of the case. That’s their responsibility of authority. If they’re deciding it under the federal constitution, it's ours. That's the burden of this Krivda case and others.\n",
      "Byron R. White: Excuse me counsel, would you have the same view if the police officer were sued for invading someone's constitutional rights and a word of damages has made against him based on the Supreme Court of Oregon’s holding and he said, “Well, that maybe the opinion of Supreme Court of Oregon but Supreme Court of United States says, that “I didn’t violate somebody’s constitutional right. Do you think you have to pay the damages based on the Oregon?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: Certainly, you have a wrong long line of cases that this Court has taken where there have been appeals by the state from a judgment of the State Supreme Court saying that the state couldn't impose a tax on a potential taxpayer either for Due Process or for Commerce Clause reasons? I would think that would cut against your reasoning here.\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: But does the state have property interest under the Constitution?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: Does it have any greater interest in collecting revenues that in enforcing the criminal law?\n",
      "Byron R. White: What you're suggesting as I gather and the one the extensions do not have to be based upon the state constitution. They can be based on the Oregon Supreme Court's reading of a federal constitution, is that it?\n",
      "Byron R. White: The other side of the argument is that (Inaudible)?\n",
      "Byron R. White: I know, I know. Does it then make a difference? What if you lose all on that? What if you are sitting here as authority, reviewing the Oregon Supreme Court decision, what about that?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: Are you referring to any state cases since Harris and which they sought to review here the state sought to review here or did the state just acquiesce?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: But there's no indication in a citation that the certiorari was sought and denied?\n",
      "Byron R. White: I know but (Voice Overlap) is rested on state law and federal law or which?\n",
      "\n",
      "Potter Stewart: Which would lead to the inference that they felt themselves not free to interpret the federal constitution in a different way from its interpretation by this Court? Do you see what I mean? Or else they wouldn’t have felt any obligation to distinguish Harris but you just said we --\n",

      "Byron R. White: Was the agreement, Bargaining Agreement with the Clerk's Union in the record?\n",
      "Tom C. Clark: Well, Mr. Kraemer, what is the procedure before the Board? I am intrigued. I know the composition of the Board so far, he said that no hearing what they do, they just assemble or --\n",
      "Tom C. Clark: Do they have affidavits or about an affidavit of--?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: In ordinary labor arbitration, and you have got lot of experience in this, is that valid point?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: Well, if the carrier argued that it was covered by clerk's agreement you would think the carrier would have something in the record?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: You say you don't know whether it was there or not?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: But you say clerk's vice-president was a member of the tribunal?\n",
      "Hugo L. Black: Did they have an oral argument or they just submit it on the papers?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: Was there any objection taken and whether the forum by the Railroad be arrested?\n",
      "Byron R. White: And that then there is no dispute between the unions?\n",
      "Hugo L. Black: Of course, they won't negotiate/mediate, is that it?\n",
      "Hugo L. Black: Well, if they won't negotiate with each other and settle and divide the job, how can it be done?\n",
      "Byron R. White: What if they come in with an agreement in their hand and said, “Now look, we didn't expect the employer to assign -- , to agree to pay people for the same work and I'm sure they selected people either didn't like to (Inaudible)either. But one of the -- (Inauidlbe) since we have got a dispute with the employer and one of the either of it hasn't and the Board said “Well, we think the (Inaudible) got disputed and just trying to get the employer, and you don't. Are the clerks bound?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: Well then, I don't understand, Mr. Kraemer. You say they can't force the clerks in because they wouldn't have jurisdiction to do that. How do they have jurisdiction if they are invited in and they come in? I don't follow that.\n",
      "Hugo L. Black: What's so good in giving them notice that you can't bind them?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: And it's like the clerks would be paid if you won -- while the clerks did the work, is that it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Byron R. White: What expiration date is your agreement with the telegraphers?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: Mr. Wilcox, did you ask the Board to bring the clerks claim?\n",
      "Byron R. White: The question is whether the Clerks should submit notice to them?\n",
      "Byron R. White: You would have to disavow that statement in White House?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Mr. Wilcox, what -- if you would prevail, what would prevent the carrier from sitting down with two groups rather than to reason that out at the bargaining table would make the two agreements ambiguous enough so that it might be interpreted either way And then, when there was a disagreement between the unions to have it and one of them brought a proceeding before the Adjustment Board and the railroad said, “well, we have just emphasized and I only let you two unions find that out and which ever one prevails and it's alright with us”. Now, what would prevent you from doing that?\n",
      "Earl Warren: We don't -- we are not dealing with how you do business but how you could do business under an opinion that this Court writes?\n",
      "Earl Warren: What would the penalty be if you did that under Section 2 that you just mentioned?\n",
      "Earl Warren: Here you have got that situation, except for the matter of intent that I put in -- you've got two situations where these people claim, at least, that the ambiguities in the two contacts raise an issue as to which one of the unions is entitled to the work. And the railroad just steps aside and says, “Alright now, that's no problem of ours; you just find it out before the Board here and what every one gets, it's alright with us”. Doesn't that be tracked from a collective bargaining -- the integrity of bargaining?\n",
      "Earl Warren: Well, I suppose that bargaining agreements would and probably should determine the extent of signal work and the intended clerical work, didn't they?\n",
      "Byron R. White: No, but I suppose that there will come a point of time when this new contract/negotiation between the telegraphers and the Railroad, correct?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Well, they just tell you that change your clerk's agreement, was that?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: Tell me this, Mr. Wilcox, if the clerks were in this case and could be forced into it, what would be the composition of the tribunal? We've been told that ordinarily you get five of the union and five, is that right? A division is five union representatives and five --\n",
      "Hugo L. Black: Now, if you had both unions then what would the composition of the union be?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: I thought I heard Mr. Kraemer say that if they were forced inevitably, the railroad would decide which would win because the union at the Railroad picked out, would vote for the Railroad and thus -- it would be to one. How would that come about?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: Well, what I want to get cleared is that the union members always include a representative of the union staff?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: Now, let me get that. In other words, what you're telling me if you had them both in, what ultimately would happen when you said the impartial referee is a single individual would be more or less the arbiter finally, is that it?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: But suppose they didn't? Well I can't -- I don't quite understand – how can the telegraphers or the clerks be the victim of the choice of the railroad that has to be because you don't bring in impartial referee in it.\n",
      "Byron R. White: Why they don't set up a board for taking as a dispute, we already have a board law?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Well, how do you suggest that the -- you think that this award should be enforced? And your idea is that both unions should be before the Board. How does the Board get them to court when the clerks say, “sorry we have notice by we don't want to come in, in the first place you do not have jurisdiction. We want -- we have no dispute with the carrier at all”. We're doing our work, he is paying our people. And if we did have one, the negotiations should have to start on the profit, like the Act said”.\n",
      "Byron R. White: And then if the clerks wanted to stay out while their contracts were being interpreted, let them stay, but they would be bound?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: They had an opportunity -- give a notice to them and they stayed out?\n",
      "Earl Warren: Mr. Wilcox, I'm just going to ask you this. Would you tell me specifically how many members would be on the Board if you prevailed and the clerks must be brought in and how these people are selected?\n",
      "Earl Warren: Now, let me ask you this. Who will approve of those five members, that carrier, the telegraphers union or the clerks union in this case?\n",
      "Earl Warren: Well, suppose that they don't operate, suppose they can't operate together?\n",
      "Earl Warren: And that Railway Labor Executives has membership of whom? Just the brotherhood or –\n",
      "Earl Warren: Now, in this case for instance, you assigned this work to the clerks. Isn't it entirely natural that your five people in voting for the railroad would join with those who were friendly to the clerks and therefore you would win in every situation?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: What you're saying really -- they really act not as a tribunal of ten but of a tribunal of two because they blocked vote, is that it?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: And what happened on that case, does that decision sticks?\n",

      "John Paul Stevens: Is... when you say everything else, do you include anything other than compactness in the concept of everything else?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Well, but this district is entirely contiguous, isn't it?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: Well, that brings us back to the point Justice Stevens was beginning to discuss with you. Isn't a State free to reject the idea of compactness if it chooses?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: Well, isn't that your basic point, Mr. Everett, that that sort of intent or motivation on the part of the legislature is subject to strict scrutiny?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Well, how much of North Carolina is the kind of State that the Voting Rights Act applies to?\n",
      "Byron R. White: But if the Attorney General... don't we have to decide here whether the Attorney General was... construction of the Voting Rights Act was correct or not?\n",
      "Byron R. White: --and pointed out that it might... one might be created in, what, the southeast corner?\n",
      "Byron R. White: The southeast corner of the State? Then he didn't... but anyway, he did... before you could get preclearance, he thought you had to have another district.\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: Mr. Everett, what's the effect of the Voting Rights Act by its terms where 40 out of 100 counties are covered?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: Supposing you were to draw a district that was entirely in areas that were not subject to preclearance. Would the Voting Rights Act have anything to do with that?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: But are all of the counties which are the subject of this district which you're complaining about... are they all subject to preclearance?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: So, many of the counties in this district are not subject to preclearance?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Well, was this... this was a three-judge court, wasn't it?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Was this issue brought before it about whether or not that 12th district was subject to preclearance at all?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Well, Mr. Everett, do I understand your argument here to be that the problem is not race consciousness as such in drawing lines, it's the specificity of the race consciousness in saying, in effect, that there must be a quota of two districts?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Well, how then do... how do you draw the line on your theory between what is a permissible use of race consciousness in this kind of districting or redistricting and what is impermissible? How is the... what is the principle on which that line is drawn?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Well, what about a case like this in which you're not so much breaking apart a district in which a violation has occurred, you've simply got to come up with another district and, as a consequence, essentially a whole new configuration? How do you... would one way to do it, on your theory, simply be to avoid a Gingles violation? Would that sort of be your... or a violation of the Gingles principles. Would that be your objective to determine what is permissible and what isn't?\n",
      "David H. Souter: What if the Attorney General had suggested in this case not that there should be a second district, minority-majority district, but that it would be permissible to have two, and he would like to know why two had not been proposed? Given the fact that you accept that some race consciousness is permissible, would that have been impermissible?\n",
      "David H. Souter: But there again we're getting back to, it seems to me, to criteria which you conceded a while ago did not themselves have any independent constitutional significance. And I think you're now coming back to the argument that race... when race is taken into account, although that may be permissible per se, it cannot be taken into account, in effect, without serving a series of other principles like compactness, community identification, and so on. And yet, you've conceded that these don't have independent constitutional significance. So, how do we derive your rule?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Well, Mr. Everett, I mean, you say community of... communities of interest can be taken into account, but doesn't that necessarily mean that racial groups can be taken into account as well? I mean, if in fact there's a community that's a religious community, a racial community or whatever, why can't that be taken into account by intelligent legislators in districting? I thought you were making that concession before.\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Well, is that any different from an assumption that an Irish Catholic will vote like another Irish Catholic and they're more apt to vote Democratic than Republican, say?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: And what is the difference between the two situations?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Well, how about religious stereotypes? So you assume that all the Jewish people will vote in one particular way. Is that different from the same assumption about black people?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Remember the U.J.O. case, United Jewish Organization case?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Well, what about drawing lines based on registered Republicans as opposed to registered Democrats, making an assumption they'll vote with the party? Can you do that?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: No, but you make a stereotypical assumption that they won't change for the next election when you draw your lines. Is that really different from any other kind of group interest?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: And, in fact, we know they don't always vote that way, just as we know that Republicans don't always vote for Republican candidates. What's the difference?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: It deals with racial-- --Yes, but of course, we're dealing with the Equal Protection Clause. Did we fight a civil war about Republicans? Does the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment apply to Republicans? I didn't think so. You don't think the Fourteenth Amendment applies to Republicans? You think it's okay for the sovereign to discriminate against Republicans? It's very interesting. [Laughter]\n",
      "David H. Souter: --Mr. Everett, just one last point to make sure I understand your principle. You're not resting on the principle of the color-blind Constitution, are you? I mean, you accept, for example, the Gingles analysis, and whatever that is, it isn't color-blind. I mean, you accept that.\n",
      "David H. Souter: Do you want us to... do we overrule... do we say that the possibility applying a Gingles analysis cannot be anticipated in redistricting?\n",
      "David H. Souter: But you... but is it fair to say that you accept the principle that redistricting can be done on the basis of trying to anticipate the possibility of a Gingles violation and to avoid it by drawing lines in such a way as to avoid voter dilution? You accept that principle, don't you?\n",

      "William H. Rehnquist: But what's the authority for that in the Voting Rights Act if only 40 counties are covered?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: So, there isn't any authority in the act itself for that? It's just an administrative authority?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: I'm not sure I understand your... I guess your good faith defense. If the intent is a constitutionally invalid intent, can it be possible that simply because the Justice Department told you you could do it, it is rendered okay? I mean, suppose the Justice Department says it's okay to discriminate in appointments on the basis of race. That happens to be wrong, but if in good faith you follow that, that makes it okay?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: It may well be, but is it your position that even if it was wrong, so long as you were relying upon that, you are immunized?\n",

      "Byron R. White: Well, yes, but don't you... suppose you had turned... decided that you didn't want a second district and the legislature... well, I'll put it this way. What does a plaintiff have to prove to show that the State has violated the Voting Rights Act in redistricting? Do they have to prove a discriminatory intent?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Well, didn't you say earlier in your remarks that your defense is the Voting Rights Act?\n",
      "Byron R. White: What did the Voting Rights Act require that led you to think that you should have a second minority district?\n",
      "Byron R. White: And did the Voting Rights Act, therefore, sort of incorporate the constitutional test?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: So, if this were a State that were not covered by the Voting Act... Voting Rights Act, would a State legislature be free, as a matter of policy, to draw a district such as this one?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: No, but take Justice Kennedy's question just one step further. Supposing just as a matter of policy, forgetting the Voting Rights Act... assume no Voting Rights Act... could the State constitutionally decide that when... if 20 percent of the population is of a particular race, that it would be good policy to have two districts in which that race represented the majority of the voters in the district?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Why? Why would... what would make it unconstitutional?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: Well, just sticking for a moment with the hypothetical of the State where the Voting Rights Act is inapplicable, section 5, the only justification for a district of this kind then is that there was racially polarized voting?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: So, if a district would either perpetuate or increase the possibilities of racially polarized voting, then the district cannot be drawn consistently with the Constitution based on race?\n",
      "Sandra Day O'Connor: In places only as wide as a highway and stretching virtually the length of the State. Do you think that a district such as that could be in and of itself some evidence of an invidious intent?\n",

      "Byron R. White: Well, the proper basis is we think there ought to be proportional representation. What's the name of the case that I think I wrote the opinion in?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Well, you've taken two different positions really. Well, it doesn't... the Constitution doesn't require you to do it, but does it permit you to do it? That's what I'm asking. Does it permit you to do it?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: But your position is that proportional representation could be... by race could be adopted by a State as a matter of policy quite consistently with the commands of the Constitution?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: You know, I'm still not entirely clear what your position would be if you did everything exactly the same and there were no Voting Rights Act. Would it be constitutional or unconstitutional?\n",

      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, it would be a different case, but are you able to say whether that would be reviewable under the EPA?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, let me just ask about how far removed it is. There is no such statute, that certainly is true, but there is a Memorandum of Understanding between the Army and the EPA, and it says, quote, \"case-specific determinations\" -- and I think that includes jurisdictional determinations -- \"made pursuant to the terms of this Memorandum of Understanding will be binding on the government and represent the government's position and any subsequent Federal action or litigation regarding the case.\" So is your -- would your argument be that because this is in a Memorandum of Understanding as opposed to a statute or a regulation, the situation is different, and that is insufficient to make the jurisdictional determination reviewable?\n",

Roberts, Jr.: Well, just to pause there, how can you do that when it says all final determinations signed either by the D -- the district engineer, who does not have authority over special cases, or the regional administration -- administrator?

      "Sonia Sotomayor: The fact that you're reserving your power is enough, even though by this memo and practice you've never done it? You think that that's not within Bennett's second prong.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Sometimes it doesn't. But I joined Bennett, and the reason I joined it is it says in the second prong, \"Or from which legal consequences flow.\" So I would assume that nothing in Bennett -- or I would have dissented -- is intended to overrule what I think is the great case on the matter, which is Abbott Labs. And Harlan, in Abbott Labs, explains completely and thoroughly what this Court has done in Frozen Food Express, what the Court did in Storer. And on the point you're now making, what he says specifically is the ICC order is right for review, even though it would have no effect until later. Someone decided to bring a particular action. He says that in Storer, the Commission, policy determination is ripe, even though it would not issue a television license -- that's what the policy said -- even though no specific application was before the court. So it wouldn't take effect until later. And the same thing is true precisely of the order in Abbott Labs itself. It was a statement of interpreting what the Commission would do, and nothing was going to happen. Nothing happened, unless later on somebody decided to violate it. Much like this. And even if they violated it, nothing would happen, unless the Commission decided to prosecute. So what Justice Ginsburg said was, once this is in effect, okay, now what happens? The person who is subject to it has to take certain steps because of the law. One, spend $150,000 to try to get an exception and fail, or two, do nothing, violate it, and possibly go to prison. Those sound like important legal consequences that flow from an order that, in respect to the Agency, is final, for it has nothing left to do about that interpretation. And B, is perfectly suited for review in the courts. So we have harm flowing from a change in legal relations, we have an agency that has nothing left to do on this particular matter, and we have a court that is perfectly suited to review it. I would say it flows from Abbott Labs, almost QED. So what is your -- what is your response to that?\n",

      "Elena Kagan: Well, on the same lines, could I ask more generally? I mean, one of the reasons I find this case very difficult is because all over the Federal government there are compliance offices of various kinds whose function is to give advice to people. And often that advice comes with very specific recommendations. It says we will not take enforcement action if, or, we do not consider it a violation of law on the following facts. And I guess what I want to know is your view of how this program compares to various other kinds of programs like this, whether it's the -- whether it's tax opinion letters, or SEC opinion letters, or FCC or whatever, how this program compares to those and where you could draw sensible lines, because mostly we want government agencies to do these things. We think that this helps people, to actually know what the government thinks about particular factual situations. So how do we draw lines in this area, in your view?\n",

Kennedy: Well, I think -- I think underlying Justice Kagan's question is that the Clean Water Act is unique in both being quite vague in its reach, arguably unconstitutionally vague, and certainly harsh in the civil and criminal sanctions it puts into practice.

      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Okay. And at the end of that, can the landowner get judicial review if the determination is that it -- it is subject to the Clean Water Act; or does the landowner have to go forward, in your view, with the entire -- all the rest of the permitting process before there is a possibility of an administrative appeal and judicial review?\n",

      "Stephen G. Breyer: Then he goes to jail. I mean, you put in your brief he risks it. In your brief -- and I think the point raised, of course, you -- it's a good idea to give people advice. Abbott Labs takes care of that. One of the three important features of Abbott Labs is you look at it from the point of view of the Agency. And you say, how formal is it? What was there left to be done? And in this case, we have a whole set, a whole part of the CFR which is devoted this, which goes to varied -- it's called \"Jurisdictional Determination from Instructional Guidebook.\" The Army Corps of Engineers is brought in. Once they make a determination, it's called the Agency's official view. It's stated it remains in effect for five years, unless conditions change. And you, in your brief, say that the issuance of an approved jurisdictional determination marks the culmination of the distinct process by which the Corps informs a landowner whether the Corps believes that covered waters are present. So that doesn't sound like someone giving informal advice, and there's an appeal process. It sounds like a formal system of answering a question, which question is: Are these lands wetlands, Federal or not? Now, if you give some kind of informal advice, fine. You'd come to a different result. But I've just listed the things here that suggest it isn't at all formal. It's a five -- informal. It's a five-year formal, definite procedurally guided CFR determination.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: It's both. And the concern on the other side, beyond the EPA, is this is a vast Federal government. And this vast Federal government can operate -- can issue many, many formal determinations on aspects of the statute. And if people are -- people are required to follow those, without court review, on penalty of going to jail if they don't just follow it, or are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars, what happens to judicial review?

You may have to go through a lengthy trial, and that's just too bad. It is a complete adjudication of the jurisdictional question. The Court's not going to return to it. Even so, you don't get any kind of appellate review until there's a final judgment in the whole case. Why should this be any different?\n",

Do you think there might be an argument that it is tolerable to wait until the end of the case when a neutral Article III judge makes an adverse judicial -- an adverse jurisdictional determination, but perhaps less appealing to wait till the end of the adjudication when the jurisdictional determination is made by an enforcement Agency?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: It isn't just -- that isn't -- the issue, I think, is this -- what I thought your answer would be is that informal advice is not final Agency action normally. There is a statute. It was passed in 1946. It's called the Administrative Procedures Act. It tries to divide such things with that word, \"final,\" as rulemaking by the Agency, from accomplishing roughly the same result by never having a rule but just telling everybody informally what the Agency will do in such circumstances. It might be that the formal is, other things being equal, final Agency action in respect to that matter. It might be that the latter is not. So I think what you're telling me is what I should do next is go read those Federal rules and regulations and see, is this more like informal advice, or is it more like formal rulemaking? And you have the latter, and they have the former, I guess. I don't know. And I go and make up my mind. I guess that's my job in this instance.\n",

Your client is exposed to the very same things under the statute, right? So because the Agency has provided something that at least is some benefit to the public it served, it becomes subject to immediate review, where, if it -- if it had done nothing, all we had was the statute, then your client is still left with the same choices, right?\n",

One response that I give to your floodgates, oh, this is going to be deceptive, you're predicating rather dumb district judges. I mean, if subject matter jurisdiction is phony, the district judge is going to say, get rid of it. Send it back. I mean, diversity, is there diversity, is there a Federal question on the face of the complaint? Every... I thought everybody agreed that in most cases the lack of subject matter jurisdiction is clear, so you don't get this floodgate. On the other hand, there is what Justice O'Connor referred to as a rare case, which I looked at this case and said, well, maybe this is it, in that this party, Norge, that's alleged to be fraudulently joined as a plaintiff, that's all bound up with the merits of this case, so you may not be able to sort out whether there was a sham party there inserted simply to block diversity until you get to the merits and to see whether this Norge has any real substance.\n",

If it was all that easy, then the majority of the court of appeals surely would have said, yeah, the panel got it right, there's no subject matter jurisdiction. But they took the extraordinary step of saying, we're not going to go back to that panel decision. We want the district judge to explore all these questions, so if you were right about it was easy, then why didn't the panel decision stand?\n",

In other words, take this example. Supposing you have attack on the line item veto case, and you want to challenge the standing of the plaintiff, and the motion to dismiss has two grounds, one he doesn't have standing, all sorts of... secondly, they didn't leave the summons at the right person at the... wherever it should have been left.

      "Stephen G. Breyer: Why, just... I've always wondered this, and I'm not saying there's no answer to it, but if all these cases, indeed, where it's Article III power versus the merits, they all are cases in which it's arguable both ways whether there is or there isn't the Article III power. We're only talking about cases in which a district judge could be reasonably uncertain. So if this is so holy that you have to decide the question of power first, why don't you have to have an immediate appeal? I mean, suppose the district judge were to get it wrong? Suppose, horror of horrors, he were to think there is Article III power to hear this case, and he's wrong, there isn't; why is he permitted to go ahead with the merits before all that's finally resolved on appeal, perhaps by certiorari?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Why? In other words, why is it that it's absolutely incumbent upon the district judge to decide every difficult, no matter how difficult question of Article III power first, including yours here, before going on to another easy question, that it isn't incumbent upon the system to decide that question definitively first?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Exactly. So why don't we have to have appeals and certiorari, and really get it solved before we can go ahead to the merits? It's a constitutional matter, after all. Why don't you have to have a full range of appeals first?\n",

Sometimes the jurisdictional issue, like the standing question, will raise a serious constitutional question, whereas the personal jurisdiction may merely be a matter of fact, or interpreting the provision of State law. What about commenting on our policy of trying to avoid constitutional, difficult constitutional questions when there's another principal basis for decision available?\n",

Remand. Don't decide it. So you said I think twice in your brief that subject matter jurisdiction doesn't have to be decided by the Federal court. If they find it a tough question, they should just send the whole thing back to the State court. I think you're... are you modifying that, because here you seem to say they must decide it?\n",

Do you base your Federalism argument simply on the dignitary interest of the State in being able to take, in effect, first crack at subject matter jurisdiction if that's possible, or does your argument rest on a further suggestion that there is likely to be a different... difference in result depending on where the State courts or Federal courts decide the personal jurisdiction? Do you suggest that the State courts are more likely to find the personal jurisdictional prerequisites present?\n",

Here, the assertion is there is no power over me compatible with due process, and since the Texas statute goes the length of due process, we don't have to worry about it, we stop short of that. It's a question of due process, and yet you're suggesting that the State court could have a burden of proof that makes it easier for a plaintiff to assert jurisdiction over a defendant than in the Federal court. I would think that that, since it's a Federal constitutional question, would have to come out the same way with the same burdens in both courts, and if the Texas courts have said something different, the defendant has to negate jurisdiction, that's--\n",

      "Earl Warren: Well may I ask this? Assuming that we do not agree with you that the figures are -- that the differential is de minimis. What justification is there for having a district of this shape and size, rather than to have a contiguous district that would equalize it? I'm looking at that map now, number six, and it looks to me like that's a most unusual kind of district in one that would normally be called a gerrymandered district?\n",
      "Earl Warren: Well, why do you have to go from one border of your state way over to the middle of the state in that circuitous way in order to carve out a district?\n",
      "Earl Warren: Now for what reason? For what reasons you say they're dealing with the legislature? What reason does the legislature have for making that district in that irregular and noncontiguous shape?\n",
      "Earl Warren: Just a question I'm trying to get at. Why isn't this one? They must have some reason for making this -- the shape it is and having it cover such a great part of your state?\n",
      "Earl Warren: Well isn't that what -- isn't that what Reynolds versus Sims tried to avoid? Trading of territory in order to bring about unreasonable distribution of the districts?\n",
      "Earl Warren: Could you have maintained the integrity of counties here by a change of this district that would've brought them more into conformity with equality?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: Well suppose you would take one of those two counties along the line between the fourth and the eighth, as I look back here. Are those two counties in the eighth along the line of the fourth? No, no that's right, right there.\n",
      "Earl Warren: Do you have any other military installations in Missouri and other parts of the state than this eighth?\n",
      "Earl Warren: Have you taken consideration, in the consideration those installations in this reapportionment?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: Well, Mr. Attorney General, the lower court was disturbed and I confess that I'm somewhat disturbed by the current fact that both the legislative committee and the legislature itself proceeded to draft, consider and enact a bill based upon, what shall I say, incorrect. I don't want to use a harsher word. Think of census figures, figures that did not truly represent the census figures for varies of these districts. And the variations between the actual census figures of 1960 and the figures that were used by the committee and represented to the legislature to be the population figures and those census figures, that difference appears to be quite material. What is the explanation of that if you can tell us briefly, because offhand it appears that the result might have been quite different in theory in a way? The result that the legislature reached might have been quite different if they had been working on the actual census figures.\n",
      "Abe Fortas: And the overage over the smallest district is in the neighborhood of 6%, is that right?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: And if you -- and I don't have -- now that's 1.85 over the ideal, isn't it?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: And the difference between the largest which is district eight and the smallest would've been what?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: So that what you're doing is comparing a 6% in approximate which is just under 6% variation in terms of the true facts as against a somewhat around of 3 to 4% variation?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: Now, taking into account the fact which I am for one accept that we should give a great deal of weight to what the legislature does, you have the curiosity here which seemed to have impressed the lower court and I must say it bothers me that the legislature proceeded on the basis of, what shall I say again using a colorless word, incorrect figures. And those figures would come out only after the court proceedings were under way, isn't that right?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: Is it a matter of calculation or don't you get from the census county by county figures?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: So it's not a matter of having to make a recalculation in which errors of allocation or what not might occur, because they get their figures from the census county by county and then it's a matter of putting them together, is that right?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: The lower court seems to have been so impressed by it and you would be really asked to do is to give the legislature the usual presumption of the correctness of its result. Despite the fact here that legislature was proceeding on obviously now admittedly incorrect data. It's a strange situation. I think you'd go that far with me, wouldn't you?\n",
      "Hugo L. Black: Is there any furious argument made here supported by strong areas part of those either who support or reject the reapportionment that there's really difference in order to change the results of the district of having a Republican congressman instead of a Democratic congressman, or a Democratic congressman instead of a Republican congressman?\n",
      "Hugo L. Black: Is that the argument it's made. Do they make an argument either side?\n",

That is to say the selected counties at various parts of the state maybe not contiguous, that that would be constitutionally unobjectionable provided that the figures worked out alright?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: -- is not -- doesn't appear to be compact does raise problem. I note that Jefferson County and Texas County were both put in to the district with the majority of the other counties to form district eight, isn't that right?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: No, I don't -- has Texas County been in the -- and has Jefferson County been in the same congressional district as Osage and Cole and Miller and so on there?\n",
      "Abe Fortas: But in any event, you would agree then and I think this may be a modification.

      "Earl Warren: Well Mr. -- counsel I noticed that district eight is 13,542 above the normal. And that four is 12,260 below. That's almost equal one above and the other one below. Now, how could they without disturbing county lines take 12,000 thereabouts from eight and give it to four?\n",

      "Hugo L. Black: Now if that's true, unless you can show something, it just shocks you someway. Just so outrageous that nobody can take it. Or you can show that it aids the Republicans or helps the Democrats or does vice versa. Why should we not take into consideration?\n",

      "Abe Fortas: May I ask you, sorry, may I ask you this question? You may want to answer it after lunch, it works to be all right for me. Your argument seems to me in one respect in a way depends upon burden of proof. And your brief I guess that the burden of proof to burden of justifying deviations from the ideal is on the state. Now I wonder if it is impossible that the question of burden of proof may be a little more complex than that. And where you have what appears to be a gross for non-permissible variation, whatever figure you may target figure one may have in mind. If I have 10% in particular. Whatever target figure in the particular circumstances one may have in mind, where there is a mathematically large or a gross deviation from the one man, one vote mathematics. But then the burden is on the state to justify it. But may it not be that where and perhaps this is such a case, and this perhaps this is such a case that where the variation is relatively modest that the burden may then be on those attacking the plan. That is to say that you're trying now to bear that burden in one respect by saying that the state could do better and could come to a closer approximation of the mathematically ideal. So my brother have asked you whether you have other complaints about the plans, such as political gerrymandering or other attempts to keep incumbents in office or whatever it may be? And as I understand it, your answer to that has been no. But what I'm saying to you is that isn't it possible that where the figures of such that the mathematical deviation does not appear gross that the burden is then on the other party, namely the party attacking the plan.\n",
      "Abe Fortas: But if you assume that they have -- the state has before its burden by showing that these figures are within tolerable range, then the only thing you've been talking about thus far is that they could've done better?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: Mr. Achtenberg, fully understanding your position that percentage comparisons per se are not very meaningful. Let me call your attention again to the table on page 55 of the appellant's brief on the merits which indicates as you agreed that Missouri seems to be the 11th best state in the union from the point of view of percentage deviations. And I notice here that in the legend on the bottom it indicates that two asterisks means that the data has been verified by court opinion. And I noticed that that's true of the following states that have larger deviations than Missouri. Mississippi, Montana, Florida, Alabama, Illinois, Kansas, New Jersey, and New Hampshire that the data has been verified by court opinion. Would it be accurate or inaccurate to infer from that with those of had court approval?\n",

      "Warren E. Burger: We'll hear arguments next in National Labor Relations board against City Disposal Systems. Mr. Come, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case, which is here on certiorari to the Sixth Circuit, involves the propriety of the Labor Board's conclusion that an individual employee's honest and reasonable assertion of a right that is provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, whose concerted activity was in the meaning of Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. The underlying facts briefly are as follows: Respondent hauls garbage for the City of Detroit from a drop-off point to a landfill some 37 miles away. The garbage is hauled by tractor trailers and normally a driver is assigned to a certain tractor trailer and when his vehicle is in for repairs he may be assigned to another one. Respondent is a party to a collective bargaining agreement with the local Teamsters Union covering its drivers. Section 1 of Article XXI of the Agreement provides that the employer shall not require employees to take out on the streets or highways any vehicle that is not in safe operating condition or equipped with the safety compliances prescribed by law. It further provides that it shall not be a violation of this Agreement where employees refuse to operate such equipment unless such refusal is unjustified. A further provision of the Agreement provides that the employer shall not ask or require any employee to take out equipment that has been reported by any other employee as being in unsafe operating condition unless the same has been approved as being safe by the mechanical department. James Brown was a driver for the Respondent. He normally drove Truck No. 245. On Saturday, May 12, 1979, he had a near accident with Truck No. 244 driven by another employee, Frank Hamilton, when the brakes on 244 would not stop the truck at a landfill. Hamilton took Truct 244 back to the drop-off point and with Brown present the mechanics told him that the truck would be fixed over the weekend or the first thing Monday morning. Brown returned to work at 4:00 a.m. on Monday, May 14th. He took out his Truck 245 to the landfill and found that the fifth wheel had a problem. He returned to the drop-off point, talked to the mechanics and learned that the truck could not be fixed that day. He then spoke to his supervisor, Jasmund, who told him to punch out and go home after confirming that Brown's truck could not be fixed. Brown punched out, but remained in the driver's room, at which point Jasmund returned and requested Brown to drive Truck 244. Brown said he would not do so since 244 had a brake problem. Jasmund instructed Brown to go home and the two had a heated exchange. Another supervisor, Madary, came on the scene, and when Brown reported that 244 had problems, Madary replied that half the trucks around here have problems and if Respondent tried to deal with all of them it would be unable to do business. During the conversation, Brown asked, Bob, what are you going to do, put the garbage ahead of the safety of the men? Madary did not reply nor did he or Jasmund make any attempt to show Brown that Truck 244 had, in fact, been repaired and was safe. Brown went home and later that day he was discharged. The Union's Recording Secretary received notice of the discharge that day and he and Brown returned to the plant and sought to get Jasmund and Madary to put Brown back to work, but they refused to do so. The next day Brown filed a written grievance under the collective bargaining agreement alleging that he had been discharged in violation of the contract. The Union declined to pursue Brown's grievance beyond the first step of the grievance procedure.\n",
      "Byron R. White: Mr. Come, if then the employee had filed a 301 suit against the employer for an illegal discharge, in order to win that, he would have had to prove a breach of the fiduciary duty that the Union owed him, wouldn't he? If he didn't allege that, it would be dismissed.\n",
      "Byron R. White: So that... But, instead of doing that, he now files with the Board, is that it?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: I read the Administrative Law Judge's findings fairly carefully and I am interested to know what is the Board's position as to the reason that the Administrative Law Judge assigned that the company used to discharge Brown? Why did the Administrative Law Judge think that Brown had been discharged? I don't want exact quotes, but--\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: --What if the company contend that Brown was discharged for failing to obey an order, an order to get back and drive 244? Now, would the Board's response still be the same?\n",
      "Byron R. White: You are saying Brown is purported to exercise the rights given him by a promise in the contract?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Now, suppose there weren't any specific promises about equipment, but the employer promised never to discharge anyone without proper cause. I think that is a normal promise, isn't it? You don't discharge people without proper cause. So, the same facts happened and Brown... and he was fired and he claimed that that wasn't good enough cause. All I did was... I didn't want to drive a truck without brakes and he took it to a grievance and the Union refused to press it and then he filed an unfair labor practice proceeding. Don't you, in effect, say that any breach of the employer of the collective bargaining contract is an unfair labor practice if it results in a discharge and regardless of whether or not the Union could or would ever be held guilty of a refusal to fairly represent employees?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: Okay. I would like to ask you a hypothetical question about the Interboro Doctrine. Supposing that a collective bargaining agreement provided that in the event of a dispute over an obligation to work overtime the employee had to work overtime as requested and file a grievance later. And suppose an employee operating under that contract refused to do the overtime and simply walked off the job. Now, would the Interboro Doctrine protect him even though he had not complied with the contract?\n",
      "Thurgood Marshall: Well, is it slightly reasonable to protect the people in Detroit from hugh sludge trucks running around without brakes?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: Would he have had to have protested at all to invoke the Interboro Doctrine?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: Well, suppose he does exactly what he is told up to a point, then just refuses, walks off, gets fired, just the way it happened here, except he doesn't make any statement at all at the time and the next day he files a grievance, as I believe he did here. Is the mere filing of that grievance a sufficient protest to invoke the Interboro Doctrine?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: Would the Board recognize any distinction between firing this person... firing him because he filed a grievance as opposed to firing him because he refused to carry out a lawful order?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: But, the Interboro Doctrine isn't limited to safety at all, is it?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Suppose the employee had never asked the Union to... anything and suppose no grievance had been filed. Why couldn't the employee, if this is an unfair labor practice, why can't the employee go right to the Board and forget the whole grievance machine? All he has to do is say I have a right, it is a joint right, I am expressing a collective right under the contract, and it was violated by the employer.\n",
      "Byron R. White: So, the employee never needs to exercise the machinery. That would just make mincemeat of the contract, wouldn't it?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: Well, Mr. Come, does the Board make it a practice, when the employee, in fact, initiates a grievance procedure, does the Board make it a practice to pursue a complaint in cases like this? Interboro says you may, but what is the Board's practice? Does it do it as a matter of practice?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: And tell the employee go that route even if he hadn't started?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: You mean if initiated when the complaint is filed, but not completed, that is the arbitration proceeding, the Board then proceeds?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Even if a grievance has been filed, it has been rejected by the employer, and then the Union refuses to carry it any further, the Board regularly does not defer. Whereas, if it goes to... If the Union agrees to take it to arbitration and that proceeding is not completed, then it will defer. But now if there is an arbitrator's decision there against the employee, what then?\n",
      "\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: --Are you on firm ground so far as the findings by the Administrative Law Judge and the Board are concerned? Did the Administrative Law Judge find the facts as you say they are?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Wasn't he... Isn't it clear though that he refused to work... He refused to work because of his concern about the brakes and that the Board and the Administrative Law Judge found that he was exercising a contract right in refusing to do so?\n",
      "Byron R. White: --You are defending the decision below that this was not an exercise of a collective right?\n",
      "Thurgood Marshall: Let me get back to the facts again. Is it admitted that this very truck almost had an accident which his truck the day before?\n",
      "Thurgood Marshall: The question is is that the same truck that almost had an accident with him two days before?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: May I ask you a question while we have got you interrupted? Just on the issue of concerted activity, putting aside all the protected questions, and you made reference to the plain language of the statute, you would agree, as I understand it, that if he had been discharged for filing a grievance without regard to its merits that that would be covered by the Act and that would be a concerted activity?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: How is that... Why is that any more concerted than what was involved here just looking at the requirement of joint action?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: But, you are prepared to assume for purposes of your argument that that individual action is \"concerted\" within the meaning of the Act?\n",
      "Byron R. White: So, again, why would his assertion be any less concerted than an actual grievance?\n",
      "Byron R. White: In these facts, when he was fired, there was no grievance?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: When he refused in the evening, why didn't that give rise to a grievance right then and there even without waiting until the following morning when he could contact the business agent or the shop steward?\n",
      "Thurgood Marshall: If he knows the truck has no brakes, he has to drive it?\n",
      "Thurgood Marshall: I take it the company is lucky. What is the fact with respect to what repairs had been made over the... in that interval?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: Then what should the Administrative Law Judge do, treat that as a presumption that the condition had remained unchanged from Friday night until Monday morning?\n",
      "Warren E. Burger: Then the case comes down to whether or not this was a contumacious refusal even to determine the facts. Is that the position of the employer, this employee was guilty of that kind of conduct?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Suppose you are wrong on that. Suppose we disagreed with you on that narrow ground which is the ground of Court of Appeals relied on. Shouldn't we send it back?\n",
      "William H. Rehnquist: Do you cite that in your brief, Mr. Ufer, American Freight?\n",
      "Byron R. White: Well, why... He doesn't mention another employee or anything else. He wants his job back, he wants back pay. Why is that concerted?\n",
      "Sandra Day O'Connor: But then why did you concede at the beginning that a grievance filed by a single employee is concerted?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Let me interrupt you for a minute. Let me be sure I get your position on this. Supposing your client fired a man for filing a grievance. There is no contract that says he has a right to, just say they set up a grievance procedure. He files a grievance. He gets discharged for that. Unfair labor practice or not?

      "Felix Frankfurter: And therefore I ask you whether you claim that in fact there was no legally significant proceeding before the Board and therefore you emphasize Moore's position. Is that your position?\n",
      "William J. Brennan, Jr.: Well, don't you really go this far Mr. Lionel, I thought I understood this from your answer to me earlier. You're in effect saying that he was privileged to litigate before the Board the merits of this discharge based upon his insistence that he was improperly discharged and was still an employee and he could have the fullest hearing on the facts in that regard and if decided adversely to him, he then was free to maintain the action that is now brought for wages, putting again an issue in this independent floor action, the legitimacy of this discharge. Is that right?\n",
      "Felix Frankfurter: But I'd like to know why -- the why of your answer to Justice Brennan. Is it -- does that mean -- he couldn't get the relief he asked and he can then go to court and get the relief he want, is that it?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: Now, Mr. Lionel, you say, the search for an administrative remedy does not preclude an action of law. What if -- what if he had been awarded reinstatement and back pay by the Board, could he then have brought this action of law for damages for a wrongful discharge?\n",
      "Felix Frankfurter: Is there no difference in your mind between starting a proceeding and having action by the Board -- and not starting a proceeding and having action before the Board -- was it a saying, can you take or block out a sentence like that in a situation in which you didn't have in which there was a vital difference and if there is between your case in that field?\n",
      "Felix Frankfurter: -- doctrine of the election of remedies doesn't require that a statute should provide for it, does it?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: Now, that -- that opinion and very frankly, I've never read it. It certainly hasn't been -- United States against Interstate Commerce Commission. Am I right in thinking that that opinion involves reviewability of a negative award?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: And as you stated at the very outset, that is not this case, is that right?\n",
      "Potter Stewart: Well, the question of reviewability of a negative money award by the Adjustment Board is -- is an interesting issue but one certainly is not -- not present in this case, is that true?\n",

Black: What would it be for the suit for the wrongful discharge with the right to trial and with the added right on your part to have the benefit of a prima facie proof like a man would have if he's charged -- he's been killed and he said it was an accident and he has a presumption in his favor. What's the difference except eventually between the kind of law suits you've filed here and the one you've filed, you've got a -- an award? What would you have to allege?\n",
      "Hugo L. Black: Would -- wouldn't you have to allege if you've been wrongfully discharged?\n",

Is there anything in the Constitution of the United States prevents the scheme from being formulated, legalized by Congress?\n",

      "David H. Souter: Isn't there a further problem here, though, that the order of the district court gave no explanation? We have no way of knowing exactly why the court ruled the way it did, and for that reason the appeal, the review, was that the original appeal was taken properly to the court of appeals, so that we are here not on appellate jurisdiction, but cert jurisdiction, if at all.\n",

      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Well, why wasn't the ruling of the district court a ruling upon the constitutionality of the statute as applied? As I understand it, you moved to dismiss the case on the ground that an individual performing the duties that Mr. Dayton performed cannot sue a member of Congress for employment discrimination and the district court denied that. Why isn't that a ruling on the constitutionality of the, of the statute as applied?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Was there a dispute about the nature of his duties?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Not how you characterize his duties, but what his duties actually were. Was there a dispute about that?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: But didn't the district court rule that somebody performing those duties can constitutionally be tried... bring suit, and it doesn't, and it doesn't violate the Speech or Debate Clause? So I don't see how that's not a ruling on the constitutionality of the statute as applied.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Don't you agree with Justice Scalia... Justice Alito? Don't you agree with Justice Alito? I thought he's saying it's a ruling on constitutionality.\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: My problem is, it's extraordinary. We have very few direct appeal cases any more and I, I am loathe to read Section 412 as embracing a decision by a court that a particular use of this statute was unconstitutional. You say it was, the statute was unconstitutional as applied. That's sloppy language. It really means that this application of the statute or the use of the statute for this purpose was unconstitutional. I think that's something different from saying that it was an order of the court upon the constitutionality of any provision. Which provision of this Act has been held to be unconstitutional?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: What is that citation? I was looking for that. Is that cited in your brief?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: But in the flag case the whole statute was either valid or not. There weren't different applications, were there?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: You mean we held that the statute was constitutional on its face?\n",

      "David H. Souter: I realize, before you leave that I realize that on a jurisdictional issue like that we have an obligation to raise it ourselves. But I'm... I'm... I'm curious, was... was jurisdiction contested in that case?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: What does he do? I mean I looked at what he does in 74, 75, 76a. He seems to spend a lot of time moving furniture. He lists that twice. He runs the office. And he represents, he is out in the local office somewhere and he talks to constituents. I mean, he doesn't even appear in the Senate office except very rarely in which case he is doing casework. So I guess if he is included in that, I mean so is a full-time furniture mover.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Oh. Where does it say that? He drafted legislation that was then introduced?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Well, he didn't do exclusively that stuff anyway. We can certainly all agree on that. And why isn't it sufficient that when any of those issues are, his activities in any of those capacities are sought to be introduced into evidence, anyone tries to contradict them, then you can bring in your Speech or Debate Clause objection?\n",

      "Stephen G. Breyer: What's wrong with this? I found what you're talking about here. It says in paragraph 13, contrary to what he says in his own evaluation, that Senator Dayton's staff, including Mr. Hanson... that's a little uncertain, what they mean by that... introduced a bill and drafted it. Okay? And then on paragraph 14 they say on November 15th, 2001, Mr. Hanson... just as you said... planned a Senate Government Affairs Committee meeting, selected hearing witnesses and prepared questions. Now suppose that we did as the court, lower court wanted to do, say let's just see if that becomes relevant. Because it's possible, given his other tasks that those two incidents, one on November 15th and the other, whenever help he gave to the drafting, had nothing to do with his being fired and nobody claims that. So what they said is let's wait and see if that becomes relevant. Now what's wrong with that solution?\n",

      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: In what sense would the member be called to answer under those circumstances, if the member isn't a defendant and has no financial liability and is able to invoke the clause as an evidentiary privilege? In what sense would the Speech or Debate Clause be applicable?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Well why doesn't it matter who the defendant is? Because I don't, this so-called office of Senator Mark Dayton is a construct that I understand, and there is no immunity problem there. But if, if that office is gone now and getting to your hypothesis, if the, if... if the true party is the Senate of the United States, has there been any unequivocal waiver of immunity with respect to the entire Senator or the Senate of the United States as an institution?\n",
      "David H. Souter: And how do we do it? I mean, you've said... I don't want to go too far with a metaphor, but you spoke a moment ago of there being sort of a, what did you say, a hole or a space in the legislative sphere when somebody is fired. In the sphere at the moment is totally empty. The Senator's gone. Everybody knows that this, this office of Senator Mark Dayton is a totally fictional construct. And in reality, as you point out, the money is going to come out of the Senate or some Senate fund. If we allow this to go forward, we've got to face the reality that it's the Senate which is the defendant and there hasn't been a waiver of immunity.\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Why isn't it a waiver of sovereign immunity when you set up a system that envisions a suit which will be paid off by the Senate? Why isn't that a waiver of sovereign immunity?\n",
      "David H. Souter: I mean, when it's done on the basis of this fiction, is that what we should accept as an unequivocal waiver?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Right. The Senate puts a limit on how much money it will spend for a particular Senator. That's all that amounts to. It doesn't hand him the money. It's still the Senate's money, isn't it? And what the Senate says is each office will have so much of a call upon our fund and no more.\n",

      "Anthony M. Kennedy: What's the test for intruding? If it would chill his exercise of the function in future cases, or if it requires him to talk about legislative decisions, or what?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: What if it required him to say how he allocated his resources, that he allocate his resources 10 percent to foreign affairs issues, 50 percent to health care issues? Would that involve is... is that a Speech or Debate Clause problem?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Yes, but what if the Senator doesn't want to put it in? I mean, what if he does not want to waive the privilege? Is his only choice in effect to sit moot and lose the case?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Well, why don't, why doesn't that... why doesn't being placed in that dilemma in effect implicate the clause, and why can't he invoke the clause as a basis for dismissal?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: That would go for a stenographer in a committee hearing?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Well, it could or couldn't be. I mean, I mean if the legislator, the Senator, says, I think relevant to my dismissal of this individual is the individual's performance that revealed itself in a speech or debate that I gave in the House, and if that's relevant, then why isn't that the end of the case, they can't bring it?\n",

      "Anthony M. Kennedy: I have one question. The Appellants here were the ones that appealed to the court of appeals? Did they appeal from the district court?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: But under 1291, the United States Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction where direct review may be had in the Supreme Court. So it seems to me that their position contradicts their own basis for jurisdiction here. Do you agree with that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Can we go back a step. I just... you said this is appealable and your reason for it being appealable was because the statute itself... you said it was not appealable and the reason not is because the statute itself said that this has to be applied consistent with the Speech or Debate Clause?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: That's your reason. So I take it, what about the reason that's been given, that this is an as-applied challenge instead of on its face? What about that as a reason for it not being appealable?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: No, no, no, I'm not asking about the argument you are making. I want to ask about an argument you aren't making, that the reason... I'll ask about the one you are making in a second. The reason I want to know about... I want to know about the other possible reason for not being appealed, namely that this is as applied and not on its face. They don't strike down any provision. What's your view about that one?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: That is correct. And what you do about this case, what is it, Eichman?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: We were told that 75 percent of the employees who were covered by the Act do not work for an individual member. So how could, how could a provision held to be facially unconstitutional under the Speech or Debate Clause?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: What could it possibly be? And if it couldn't possibly be then what did Congress have in mind when it provided it for an interlocutory appeal from a ruling on the constitutionality of the statute.\n",

      "Sonia Sotomayor: Do -- do you see a conflict between the language of our decisions where we often say that Miranda rights have to be clear and those decisions that say that whatever is said has to reasonably convey the essence of the Miranda warnings? Is there a difference between those two statements, and which of our cases or statements would control?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: So you would suggest that if something is not clear and it's ambiguous, that that's enough? Or -- or is there a difference between reasonable and clarity? That has to be read in a certain way; otherwise an ambiguous warning--\n",

Well, didn't they cite the then-FBI warning? It has been improved considerably, but there was an FBI warning cited in Miranda itself, was there not?\n",

Where does it say that? Interpret it any way you want. You know, we are used to grand juries. In a grand jury, he can go consult with a lawyer, but he doesn't have the lawyer with him. So, where does it tell him that?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Don't have you a right to talk to a lawyer at a grand jury?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Yes, correct. And so aren't you supposed to tell this person, that unlike a grand jury, you have a right to have the lawyer with you during interrogation? I mean, it isn't as if that was said in passing in Miranda. They wrote eight paragraphs about it. And I just wonder, where does it say in this warning you have the right to have the lawyer with you during the interrogation?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: It doesn't use the word \"present\", Miranda? It says right here: \"We hold\" -- it says -- \"not just prior to questioning, but also to have counsel present during any questioning. \" That's what Miranda says. And then Miranda, after discussing it for five pages, goes on to use the words I just said. You have to tell him he has the right to have counsel with him. So it does use the word \"present\".\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Well, what FBI are we talking about? Because the FBI advice of rights says: \"You have the right to have a lawyer with you during questioning. \" Were they -- and -- and I was taken by the fact, \"We hold that an individual must be clearly informed. \" And so, is there some other case that says -- or some other FBI statement that they give people that doesn't use the words \"with you\", that says you don't have to say \"with you during\", or doesn't have to say \"present during\"? Was there some other case that said that?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: --I have a difficulty in terms of this argument about burdening law enforcement. This is a preprinted form that the police made up, correct?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: So what's the added burden by making the form absolutely and abundantly clear or conforming the form to the statements in Miranda? What's the cost to the State? They're going to print the form anyway. They are telling their officers to read from the form anyway. What's the added cost?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: Well, there is a question about how much the subjective intent of the questioner should be involved in this process or not. There are cases where it appears the plurality of our Court has said it should always be an objective standard, and others where certain members have expressed a question about subjective. But if we are dealing with a printed form, why wouldn't the intent of the entity at issue be placed in question? Meaning, you could have -- the police here could have chosen to be explicit, but instead they chose to be -- to obfuscate a little bit and be less explicit. Shouldn't we assume that that's an intent to deceive or perhaps to confuse?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: But why? The -- the easy solution is to do what 90 percent of the jurisdictions are doing: Copy Miranda.\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: What about the danger that Tampa, if you should prevail, will go back to the old way? Now, it has a clearer form -- whether this form was adequate is one thing. But now, it has the form that the -- like the one the FBI currently uses. If you prevail, then Tampa can go back to what it had before?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Well, once we say this is properly given, my goodness, here's -- here's an instruction approved specifically by this Court. I mean, I think they should use that, don't you? I mean, the other one they are going to have to guess about, but this one is approved in a case involving Florida by this Court. So you -- it's pretty attractive to use that one.\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Well, you have to say it's okay. You are arguing that it's perfectly okay, so why do you hesitate when you are asked, you know, could the State go back to doing it? You should say, yes, of course, they -- they might; we don't think it's likely, but they might, and if they did, it's perfectly okay. Isn't that your position?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Let me -- let me ask you one question. Isn't it the case that this particular warning is used in one judicial district, and the warning that was approved in Traylor was used in the rest of the State? And so there is an interest -- the Florida Supreme Court has, in effect, required the same warning throughout the State. And if you prevail, there may be one standard warning in one judicial district, and the other districts may continue to use the one they have used in the past. Isn't that right?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: That's true, but if you -- if they all followed the Florida Supreme Court in this case, then they all would use the same warning?\n",

      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Where -- where is that? Is that set forth in the -- in the briefs? The FBI form? Where -- where is that set forth?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: --What -- how do we deal with the fact that, if the purpose of Miranda is to give clear warnings, and your adversary says -- not your adversary -- your co-counsel -- Petitioner's counsel says that means -- \"clear\" means does it reasonably convey? We've got a split of circuit courts and State courts on whether this reasonably conveys or not. Shouldn't that be enough of an ambiguity for us to conclude it can't reasonably convey, if there's this many courts holding that it doesn't?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: Are you calling the Florida State Supreme Court majority unreasonable jurists?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: What happens now is that we are dealing with the exception rather than the rule, and -- but this was the rule, meaning this was the form that they were reading. And if it has some significant ambiguity in it, sufficient for at least one court to say it wasn't sufficiently clear, it wasn't explicit enough, should we worry about the exception as an exception?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Mr. O'Neil, isn't one of the problems here that Florida had two different printed forms before this case arose, and that Florida Supreme Court has said they'll all have the same one hereafter?\n",

Some parcels are the ones the Indians choose to buy and are able to buy are called Indian territory and everything else is governed by New York state, isn't it? It's just a terrible situation as far as governance is concerned and part of the blame for the situation we're in is that the Oneidas did not claim about this for 170 years.\n",

I'm still thinking that a trespass action for trespasses that occurred in 1850 or 1700 is worth millions today, even if it's tiny, because of the interest, passage of time, et cetera. When you add that to the value of the land, I'm thinking of numbers that are astronomical. And yet that hasn't happened.

      "John Paul Stevens: Can I have one other question, then I'll be covered everything I had at the back of my mind. What if the agreement were totally ambiguous, and I think I read the court of appeals opinion the way you do, too, saying that even if some of the property might not be forfeitable, nevertheless we construe the agreement as an undertaking to forfeit everything. Assume it's clear that that's what the agreement was in exchange for a somewhat lesser sentence, would that agreement be enforceable, in your view?\n",

      "David H. Souter: Let me-- --Then-- --Go on. No, you. I'm sorry. That's all right. Maybe I misunderstood you before. If that is so, why does it matter... why is it crucial to characterize it?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Let me make this suggestion to you. Let's assume for the sake of argument there is in fact a Sixth Amendment right to the determination with respect to the forfeiture. I don't know whether there is or not, but I mean, there's an argument for it. And let's assume also, for the sake of argument, that the Boykin requirements are in fact constitutionally mandated and not merely our choices of the best way to get from here to there. If you make those two assumptions, then I suppose you would argue that the statement of factual basis was constitutionally mandated, wouldn't you?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Then why don't you make some such argument here? Why don't you say, for example, in order to avoid having to grapple with these constitutional issues about the Sixth Amendment requirement of jury verdict on forfeiture and the exactly mandatory character of Boykin, the way to avoid those issues is to read Rule 11(f) to require the statement of factual basis, and why don't you make that argument, which would not require a characterization one way or the other? We could leave that issue in limbo.\n",
      "David H. Souter: But if you're making that argument, you don't have to make the characterization on an either-or basis, do you?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Ms. Beale, do you get that from Rule 11(f)? I mean, if you're making a constitutional argument, I suppose we can discuss Boykin, but how do you find that in Rule 11(f), which speaks of notwithstanding the acceptance of a plea of guilty, a guilty plea, doesn't it?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Why do you want to rely on 6(f)? I mean, it seems to me you have your finger on a problem that bothered the Sentencing Commission for several years which we couldn't resolve, and why you want to rely on (f) I don't know, because the language doesn't fit it, nor does the fact that forfeiture appears in the U.S. Code under the term \"sentencing\", nor to about five other things, including I never heard this one made, but that doesn't destroy your point. What I want to know is, is what I think you're actually trying to argue, and you don't have to jump to the Constitution, you're trying to argue that the sentencing statutes require, before a judge accepts a sentence... and that would apply to forfeiture and five other things, but you don't argue it... before he does that, that he establish that there is some basis for the statutory requirements or guideline requirements for that sentencing existing, that that's what you want to say. And I can tell you exactly why the Sentencing Commission danced around it, which I'm... first of all, if you say that's part of the Constitution, if it is, the sentencing practices of 50 States are really in trouble, including... and moreover, if you say it's part of the code, what normally happens in many sentences will no longer exist in the entire Federal system. All right, so I want to know what to do here. That is, the argument isn't made squarely. It's made in a context where the language and five other things are against it, but the argument's a serious one, and as you well know, in the guidelines, Chapter 6, the Commission dances around it by saying that the judge may, after deciding that the facts are not such, decide to impose the true sentence irrespective of what the parties agree, but it doesn't say must. Now, that's what I would like you to address, because I quite honestly don't know exactly what to do about this.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: And if not, if I don't think the language or anything else really fits, then what? We just say, we'll decide this another time, or what?\n",

      "John Paul Stevens: Well, supposing we find a factual basis for the offense, but no factual basis for the forfeiture. Then what do you do?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: But does that require... I'm still trying to find out, do you go back to status quo ante and set aside the guilty plea, or do you merely modify the judgment insofar as it affects forfeiture. Which do you think is correct?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: I still don't know which is the right... which are you saying they must do, set aside the entire plea, or just the part that relates to forfeiture?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: --I'm trying to find out from you what you think the district court must do. If he finds that there is a factual basis for the plea of guilty of the offense but not for any forfeiture, what must he do?\n",

      "John Paul Stevens: Can I ask you a preliminary question to kind of narrow the issue? Supposing... the reason for it is so that the court should not enter judgment upon the plea unless there's a factual basis. Supposing the maximum sentence authorized by statute is 10 years, and there's a plea agreement that will accept 12 years, could he enter a 12-year judgment?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: And secondly, supposing there is clear... that there's no factual basis for a forfeiture, but there's an agreement by the defendant, I'll forfeit $10 million because I'm going to get a 5-year sentence, but there's no statutory legal basis for a forfeiture, could that agreement be enforced?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: And what if that is shown after the judgment is entered, then what happens?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Is it sufficient satisfaction to say that I've got an agreement in front of me in which the defendant says, I agree to forfeit X dollars?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: If one doesn't read the agreement that way, one merely reads it as an agreement to forfeit everything I own, which one could read it, would the judge be permitted to enter this judgment?\n",
      "David H. Souter: All right. Now, what about the claim of the right to forfeiture. Can a stipulation that he will but he agrees to forfeit be a sufficient factual basis?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Now, why the difference? Why is it enough on forfeiture, but it's not enough on guilt or innocence?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Is it the fact that the rule applies on guilt or innocence and the rule doesn't apply on forfeiture?\n",

      "Antonin Scalia: Where in this plea agreement did the defendant acknowledge the factual basis for his giving up his title to all his property?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: I think your case would be a lot stronger if you said the defendant agrees that all of these assets are properly forfeitable at law, and he agrees to transfer them all to the Government. All it says, however, is he agrees to transfer them to the Government. Now, how do you find what you say is the necessary factual concession in that?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: Well, is it irrelevant... what if the agreement made it perfectly clear that half of his assets were forfeitable properly, but the agreement nevertheless provided for forfeiture of all of his assets, so there was a clear, factual basis for saying that everything covered by the agreement is not authorized to be forfeited. What would happen then?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: --And what if the plea agreement says nothing at all-- --Yes. --about whether it is properly forfeitable or improperly, it just says, he agrees to forfeit all his assets?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: I'm not talking about-- --What about his obligation? --I'm talking about what he has to do. Wouldn't he do exactly what the judge is trying to do in this case?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Never mind that. Answer my question, would you. What does the judge have to do when he gets a plea agreement that says nothing more than he agrees to forfeit all his assets, period, and there's no colloquy with counsel which you contend suggests that there's an acknowledgement that they are all forfeitable? There's no acknowledgement at all that they are forfeitable, just he agrees to forfeit all of them. Is that an adequate plea agreement?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: Well, suppose that's not a reasonable way to construe the agreement, but that after the plea is accepted, he then holds a complete forfeiture hearing, is the plea still invalid? It seems to me that you're conceding more than you should. It seems to me that you're saying that he has to make either a finding that there's a factual basis, or at least construe a concession or an agreement that way, for the plea to be valid.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: What is the right form of words in your opinion? Where we are, as I take it, is, forget about 11(f). That has to do with guilty pleas. We're now talking about Justice Stevens' question, which is that a judge is never free to impose an illegal sentence, and here we have a forfeiture statute, we also have a statute that governs in very great detail sentences of all sorts and shapes, and one of the major questions is the extent to which parties can stipulate to facts relevant to sentencing which aren't true. So this governs quite a lot, and the issue, I take it, is what's the right form of words for this Court to write as to the duty imposed on a Federal district judge to determine independently what the facts are in respect to a fact relevant to sentencing to which the parties have agreed? Now, there are two guideline sections written on this, and neither answers that question, so what is the Government's view, because I don't see how to write this case without taking a view on that, though it isn't fully argued.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Yes, right. If they had said right here, as your directive, I guess, of November 1994 now tells everybody to say, the defendant should stipulate as to what the facts are, that if that were clear, there wouldn't be a problem. You could just say, yes, there's enough here. Or alternatively, if there were nothing, I guess it wouldn't be a problem. We could say there's nothing here. What is... but we might have to be in that ambiguous area where it would be useful to have a standard as to what there has to be, and that's why I'm asking what in your opinion... and I think it's quite difficult to answer, but we may have to answer it. What, in your opinion, is the correct form of words to describe... I'd be repeating myself. You've taken it in, right?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: --given that there is a stipulation. Maybe there is no independent duty, but maybe there is some. Maybe you have to look at the presentence report. Was there a presentence report here?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: But is it correct that that issue has to be reached by this Court when we write the case? The issue is the validity of the plea and whether a jury was waived as to the forfeiture determination, that's all.\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: Can you or do you take the position that if the judge takes appropriate action to determine forfeitability after the entry of the plea, that the plea is valid?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: All right, and that's the first question. Now, what about the waiver of the right of a jury to determine forfeitability? Does the entry of a guilty plea waive the right of a jury to determine forfeitability at the sentencing stage?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: I'm not asking you anything abstract. I'm asking you about, this is a peculiar kind of a jury trial right. Does defendant waive that even though he has no notion that it exists because nobody told him about it?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: How can you waive something that you don't know you have a right to?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Well, yes, but here, if we make the assumption for the sake of argument that this particular right, the jury determination with respect to forfeiture, is of constitutional dimension, then it would be very odd to say that the same guilty plea which waives the right to a trial on guilt and innocence should be treated differently from the guilty plea insofar as it waives the jury determination with respect to the forfeiture. I mean, why would you draw that distinction? There's no pragmatic reason to do so. It's not that you would be interfering with the relationship between counsel and client, or what-not. Why would you ever draw that distinction if you assume that in fact it is of constitutional... that the determination on forfeiture is of constitutional significance?\n",
      "David H. Souter: No, but just why... just... my question is, why would you want to draw that distinction? What would make that a rational and sensible distinction to draw?\n",
      "David H. Souter: That does sound as though you're rejecting my premise. [Laughter] And if you don't reject my premise, what's your answer? Why would you draw that distinction?\n",
      "David H. Souter: So if you were standing there listening, wouldn't you draw the conclusion that you had a jury trial right on guilt and innocence, and likewise conclude that you didn't have a jury trial right on anything else?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: --Mr. Stewart, can I ask you... your time is about to expire... two questions about this particular case? Am I correct that the only issue before the court of appeals was the order of forfeiture, not the plea of guilt or innocence?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: And secondly, is it your reading of the court of appeals opinion that the post plea proceedings on forfeiture that the district judge was conducting cannot be conducted under the holding of the court of appeals?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: And did the presentence report go into any of these facts?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: My point is, is there anything in that that would add to the quantum of information that the sentencing judge had if the obligation is on the sentencing judge to determine whether there is a basis for the forfeiture that he ordered?\n",

      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: Well, what -- what about Clemons? Because Clemons is a precedent of this Court that says that the appellate court can do reweighing. Is that still good law?\n",

      "Sonia Sotomayor: -- the -- the court below only reached your first issue, whether this was a new proceeding or not. It didn't reach the second. If it had, what does it have to do? Shouldn't we be remanding for that second question?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: You -- you have presumed that it would have to do Ring, but my colleague, Justice Kavanaugh, has raised a question of why not. Shouldn't we be letting that be aired below? Shouldn't we just reach the first question and leave the second open and let it be completely aired? I mean, there is at least one Arizona case, Styles, where the court, following Clemons, basically said it's only the appellate process that was at issue in the decision below; we can redo the appellate process without applying Ring and Hurst. I don't know if it would choose to do that again with new argument, but shouldn't we give it an opportunity to do that?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: Well, that's your argument. I'm just saying, shouldn't we let the appellate court make that decision?\n",

      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: All right. Well, I mean, put -- put aside these preservation issues, which we can sort out for -- for ourselves. If the Arizona Supreme Court in the decision on direct appeal had made it clear, if it did not already, but assuming that the Ninth Circuit majority was right, if they -- if they had made it clear that they were taking into account the mitigation evidence, irrespective of whether there was a causal connection with the commission of the offense, would there have been an error?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: You're wrong about the causal, says the Ninth Circuit. Back to the Supreme Court. Supreme Court says we will redo our reweighing. We will now not use causal. Why does it have to go back to the -- if their law really is -- if it really is the Supreme Court can do this way, why does it have to go back to the trial court?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: All right. Okay. But we don't have to send it back because of Ring. Is that true? I mean, Ring, if it's now current law that applies, can they do this. Can they say, yes, it applies, correct, correct, but not to the aggravating part because the aggravating part was done correctly under old law --\n",
      "Elena Kagan: So, on question 1, why would Ring apply? I mean, I guess the -- the issue is, is the defendant getting a kind of windfall if Ring applies? The error here has nothing to do with Ring. And Ring only comes into the picture because the -- the court is trying to create -- is trying to correct a different error. Why is it that, you know, a -- a non-retroactive rule should all of a sudden pop up and the defendant get the benefit of that rule?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: -- you're requiring a new jury sentencing 28 years after the murders and after the victims' families have been through this for three decades. And that's not required by Clemons, I take your point on that, but the whole point of Clemons -- and I -- I understand your argument -- was the appellate court can do this. And there was a passionate dissent, you've read it, by Justice Blackmun saying this was really quite wrong to allow the appellate court to do this. But the Arizona Supreme Court, presumably aware of that law, did it itself. And why -- why go back to a jury resentencing 28 years later?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Why are you really -- why are you not asking for a windfall? Indeed, maybe a double windfall. You are effectively getting retroactive application of Ring, which is not retroactively applicable to anybody else. And not only that, what you really want, I gather, is a jury -- is -- is not the correction of a Ring error. It is the -- it is another shot at convincing a jury to hold that somebody who is going to be found death-eligible in all likelihood should, nevertheless, not get the death penalty.\n",

I think that one of the -- was it Justice Hurwitz who said it was a do over? It was a do over of direct review. There was nothing collateral about it. It was -- there was an error on direct review, so we sent it back for a new direct review.\n",

They don't have authority over state collateral proceedings. They were reviewing a state direct appeal, and they said the sentencing was not done right. You have to do the sentencing again. So which sentencing are we talking about? We're talking about the sentencing in the state direct appeal.

      "Elena Kagan: When -- when you say that the proceedings were collateral, and putting aside the question of whether that gets you out of the obligation to apply new rules of constitutional law, is the labeling collateral, does that make a difference in terms of what the State Supreme Court actually does?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: That may be -- I think you're answering a question I didn't ask. Assume that this had gone back to the state appeals court on direct review. In other words, it had gone up, the Ninth Circuit said that there was a mistake, the appeals court says: Okay, we have to correct our mistake. Would it look any different if you labeled it \"direct\" as opposed to \"collateral\"?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: But I guess I'm -- I'm asking you to do it the second time around both ways. In other words, it's gone up. The Ninth Circuit has said: It's in error. One way the Ninth Circuit has said you have to reopen the direct proceedings. On that reopening, the direct proceedings, after the finding of error, would you go through the entire analysis all over again, or would you just make the correction in the exact same way that you made it in the collateral proceedings?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: The question is what happens after the Ninth Circuit says go correct the error. Okay? And if all you're doing in this supposedly collateral review is correcting the error as any other state supreme court would do when they're told to go correct their mistake on -- in -- in -- in the direct appeal, then the fact that you label it collateral does not seem to make all that much of a difference.\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: -- could I ask, I think, maybe the same question? But if this had come up on -- to this -- this Court on direct, we'd said what the Ninth Circuit said, Eddings error, and sent it back to the Arizona Supreme Court, would that remand proceeding at the Arizona Supreme Court have looked different, I think, from the collateral proceeding that occurred here?\n",

And over here in the A pan are a whole bunch of aggravators, and over here in the B pan are a whole bunch of mitigators. And now it is the law in Arizona, imagine, that this weighing can take place in the Supreme Court of Arizona, period. Okay? Suppose that's the law. It's all fine. But they make a mistake about the B pan. There's some mistake which is found out later. So it's sent back to them. And you say, well, they can do the weighing anyway under -- under Arizona law. That's it. They just have to redo it. But wait, in the meantime, a new constitutional principle has been announced. And the new one is, when you see what's in the A pan, that has to be found with a lawyer present. You see what's in the B pan? A lawyer has to be present. And, lo and behold, this person had no lawyer at sentencing. Wouldn't it be obvious in that case that you can't do the weighing in the Supreme Court of Arizona without sending it back for a hearing where there's a lawyer?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Yeah. The new rule that is announced is that the A pan factors and the B pan factors have to be found with a lawyer present. All right? I mean, a lawyer has to -- you understand what I'm saying. Gideon v. Wainwright, step 2 or something. I don't know.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: -- but why in heavens name wouldn't they? I mean, of course, that's going to be the next thing I'd ask. But -- but, if I take your view that they don't apply, it sounds as if we'll -- I'm trying to make it as basic as I can. Hey, you have to have a lawyer. And, by the way, when you do that reweighing, you're going to reweigh factors that were found without a lawyer. And I think it's obvious you couldn't do that. And if it's obvious you couldn't do that, Ring says about the same thing. And Hurst. It doesn't say you have to have a lawyer present, but it does say a jury has to find those bits that are there in the A pan, and -- and -- you see that's -- that -- and I -- and I want you to -- you don't want me to reason that way, and so I want you to tell me why not.\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: And that's still true if it's Gideon v. Wainwright?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: Well, possible, but maybe the reason that you're going to the harmless error case instead of your own case is that, in your own case, the error had to do with the fundamental question of sentencing, which is weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and coming up with the right sentence. And that you're having to do again because the initial inquiry had a constitutional defect. And whether you say that you're doing it in a collateral proceeding or you say that you're doing it in a direct proceeding, I mean, essentially, you're -- you're having a new proceeding to correct the constitutional error, and you're having it in the year 2019, when Ring would apply to any other new proceeding. And the question is, why does your new proceeding not also have to comply with Ring?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: On -- on the harmless error point, to pick up on Justice Kagan's question, I think you were saying that harmless error could have been done by the Ninth Circuit on habeas, and so, too, a state habeas court could do the harmless error analysis. Is that correct so far?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: Okay. And then I think Justice Kagan's point gets at the question of what's -- is this different in essence on some fundamental way from harmless error analysis. I think your answer is no. And can you -- if that's true, can you explain that?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: Could -- you resisted Justice Kavanaugh a little bit when he was trying to equate the harmless error to this. And I think you started to say this was something more than harmless error review. Is that correct?\n",

And there's also -- maybe not applicable to this case, but in many of the cases covered by this -- also the opportunity for the -- the pre-assessment determination as well.

But we normally think of equitable tolling, I -- I thought, as a traditional common law rule that we don't assume Congress displaces lightly. It legislates against the backdrop of the common law. But, here, we don't have a court of law. The Tax Court, you can call it an Article I court, one might call it an Article II agency, but, whatever it is, it's not an Article III court.

I mean, you make some strong arguments, but, you know, Ms. Sherry points out that the nature of these CDP proceedings might reflect, as Justice Alito said, what is Congress's intent or might -- might be more consistent with a plan to permit equity.\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: On the statutory language, the fact that, as you say, there's a narrow dispute and there's reasonable arguments both ways about how to read the parenthetical, doesn't that, under our precedents going back 20 years or so now, kind of end the case? Because there has to be a clear statement, we have said, and we've been increasingly strict about that, and the fact that there's a reasonable debate about how to read the parenthetical, you can read it one way, you can read it the other, doesn't that just end it?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: But it's in the same sentence, and that helps you no doubt, but it's still, I think, debatable which part of the sentence preceding the parenthetical it applies to, right?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: So does that mean it's well established -- look, the obvious thing in English -- I don't know about the last antecedent rule and so forth, but -- but just in ordinary English, it says here \"such matter.\" Okay? Now that could refer to the appeal of such determination, or it could refer to the appeal of such determination filed within 30 days. Okay? Now I think that was Justice Kavanaugh's point. And it got me why it couldn't refer to either. And -- and then, if you go back to (e), it does say timely, but, I mean, you go back to laws -- Black's Law Dictionary, I don't know, maybe you go back to Justinian, and it says what tolling does is it stops the clock. Okay? It stops the clock. So, if you do have tolling and you stop the clock for three days because the person involved was very ill or his family was or something, and the best reason in the world he couldn't get to the post office, there was black ice everywhere, I don't know, but then it stopped three days later. Okay? Then it was timely when he got around to filing it, and they excused it. I mean, can't it be read that way? I mean, I guess everybody's asking the same question, just emphasizing \"can't.\"\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Okay. My only other question is, what terrible thing will happen if, in fact, we say, okay, yeah, you can have equitable tolling? I mean, there are other provisions that say you can't file a petition that's going to interfere with the levying. There's another provision that says it can't be frivolous. So we have those two in operation. So what awful thing will happen?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Suppose that (d)(1) were worded just slightly differently, and this is not the kind of language you usually see in a statute, but indulge the hypothetical. So suppose it said the person may within 30 days of a determination under this section petition the Tax Court for review of such determination and, by the way, the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter. What would you say then?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Really? Because, when -- when you say \"and, by the way,\" that signals you're switching to a different subject.\n",

      "Neil Gorsuch: Mr. Bond, on -- on that score, just to follow up on Justice Alito, \"such matter\" could, it seems to me, refer to -- talking about last antecedents -- at least three things here. One, it could refer to a determination under this section, in which case, as -- as -- as Justice Sotomayor suggested, you might face difficulty because there's been a determination under this section. So that -- that -- that -- that confronts the government with problems, number one. Number two, it could be a petition, as -- as your colleague on the other side argues, Ms. Sherry, without respect to time, in which case that would also present the government with problems. Or, number three, it could be the petition taking cognizance of the time, which is the government's position. So acknowledging that there are at least three possibilities here and only one of which obviously helps the government, what am I supposed to do?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch: But do you agree with me those are the three possibilities and two of them are rather difficult for the government?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch: That's the universe, and two of them are -- are challenging for the government?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: Mr. Bond, can I ask you -- so Justice Gorsuch has just identified the universe of possible interpretations. Let's say that I think the government's interpretation is maybe a little bit more plausible but not a slam dunk. In light of the backdrop of the clear statement rule, what am I supposed to do with that? I mean, how clear does it have to be?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: But that sounds like you're saying what we do in ordinary interpretation, which is just conclude what the most plausible interpretation of the ordinary language would be. But a clear statement rule requires a little bit more than that, doesn't it?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: So you think that the rule kicks in only in a case of ambiguity?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: Mr. Bond, my law clerk tried to explain my simple thinking when I was reading this provision, and I'm not sure I fully understand her response, and perhaps you can explain it to me. If your reading is that the (d) provision provides the court with -- is a jurisdictional time limit, that means in my mind that the Tax Court has no jurisdiction to do anything unless the petition is filed on time, correct?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: -- under normal circumstances, you would say we don't really need (e)(1)?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: So why doesn't that add to your adversary's position that there is enough ambiguity given that it is, even by your definition, a belt-and-suspenders provision?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: Mr. Bond, this may be an out-of-left-field question, but how should I think about this clear statement rule, how should I think about applying it in this case or more generally, if I'm -- if I have more than a suspicion that Congress has no idea what we're talking about in this area, that we keep on saying these words and presuming that Congress understands them, and I don't see any evidence that Congress really does. And if I think that's so, I mean, I guess you can argue with me, because you can -- you've talked a lot about Congress signaling this and Congress saying that. But, I mean, my gut is that Congress has never read any of our cases in this area. What should I do then?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: But I think Justice Kagan's question is more general. You know there have been efforts from time to time in the lower federal courts to send opinions to Congress. There is a drafting section in both houses. Does the Solicitor General's Office ever get together with them and say: Look, here -- here are some general statements in these opinions, we're just calling them to your attention?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: Well, to pick up on Justice Kagan's question some more, because I think it is an important point, and the separation of powers point, Treasury is constantly going to Congress and saying we have a problem with this, that, and the other thing, right, in the legislative -- in the -- in the statutes, right, and to fix this and fix that. And one of the things presumably Treasury could emphasize is we need to be clear about the importance of these deadlines. We need to be clear about the word \"jurisdiction.\" That's very -- it wouldn't be the SG's office, but Treasury, legislative affairs, would be up there all the time, right?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas: One small question. Mr. Bond, you mentioned several times that this would have significant effect, a spillover effect to other provisions if we rule against you. But, with that aside, how many appeals are we talking about, these collection due process appeals are we talking about?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas: Okay. And -- and how much -- if -- if we rule against you, how will that number change? Not the universe, but those numbers -- the 1100?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: I got that point. But you're not worried -- or correct me if I'm wrong, because I'd like to know this -- if we rule against you here, you still have a good argument that 6213(a) is jurisdictional?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh: Okay. And then the second argument, picking up on Justice Barrett's question, I -- I struggle with the question she asked too: How -- how clear is clear? I thought you were saying, to satisfy the clear statement rule, so long as the word \"jurisdiction's\" been used, then you go to the best -- the best reading. Is that not what you're saying? Maybe that's not what you're saying.\n",

And the argument was made that this person was not the normal inhabitant of the... what was he? A houseguest or something of the sort. And the only issue that Olson addressed was his right to raise a Fourth Amendment claim. It did not respond to the issue that you are raising, which is the reasonable extent of search.\n",

I'm imagining that. And you might have thought, if factor one turns out to be invalid, the reason that that's a big mistake, because the jury would have weighed something against all that mitigating evidence that it shouldn't have. And what's something? There would be a lot of evidence on it, so it took it... evidence into account it shouldn't have. So, I might have thought that was so. But when I read the cases, that isn't so, because I think it's... in Clemons the evidence would have come in anyway. So, if that isn't so, what could be wrong with this problem in the \"weighing\" State? And the answer, I guess, has to be that the prosecutor or the State said, \"Jury, you look to these three things. \" with a tone of voice that really made them important. And the jury then weighed one and two and three. It didn't have anything to do with the evidence. Well, if that's the problem, California seems to have that problem, because one of the things it says to weigh is, \"Weigh circumstances of the crime\". And that means that's not everything. That's not the history of this defendant. And so, the problem that existed in Clemons and in Stringer and in Zant that led to constitutional error seems to be there in California's case, too. Now, I probably have made five mistakes in my little recitation here, and I'd ask you to point them out. [Laughter]\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: It is, indeed, very complicated, Ms. Kirkland. And, I forget, which provision of the Constitution is it that contains this complexity? [Laughter]\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: And may I ask you a question about the California statute, if I may, please? In subsection (a) of 190.3, it says that the trier of fact \"shall\" take into account any of the following factors, if relevant. And one of those is the existence of any special circumstance found to be true, pursuant to 190.1. And under 190.1, one of the special circumstances is number 14, \"heinous, atrocious, or cruel. \" Does that mean the statute required in the weighing process... that the jury take into account that factor? And is it not true that factor was held invalid?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: --Would you agree, though, that, if you had a separate sentencing jury, one that did not have all the evidence, and that jury was instructed that at the guilt phase a determination has been... that has... it has been found that the crime was especially heinous, atrocious, and so forth, that that finding might tip the scales in favor of imposing the death penalty?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: --cases in which we have held a fact of... a finding of the fact of this kind was irrelevant, was harmless? I think the cases are all the other--\n",
      "Sandra Day O'Connor: Ms. Kirkland, assume for a moment... I know you don't agree, but assume that the court, or a majority of it, were to hold that California appears to be a \"weighing\" State. This case arose before the enactment of the Federal law that we call AEDPA. So, I guess pre AEDPA law governs. And we would then have to consider... what +/? whether this is harmless error? But the third question that you raised was... apparently did not incorporate any consideration of the Brecht standard. Is that what would be applied if we had to address the consequence here, of holding it to be a \"weighing\" State?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: --I have one background question. And maybe I missed something. Number 14, \"where it was especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel. \" --taken alone, that would be vague. But I thought that in Profitt we said that if it were... if there were a gloss given by the courts in interpreting that standard so that it was made more specific, evidenced in a pitiless attitude, pitiless crime, that then it was valid. Has a Federal court, or have we said, that this provision is unconstitutional? Or do we just assume that in this case?\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: What did... what did the California Supreme Court hold? Did it hold that considering the \"heinous, atrocious, or cruel. \" nature of the crime as part of the totality of the balancing was improper, or did it hold that that language is insufficient to form one of the narrowing functions that the aggravating circumstances--\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: Counsel, I was confused by your answer to Justice O'Connor's question. Do you think the... we should review the California Supreme Court's harmless error analysis, or should we undertake a Brecht analysis?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: So the... so the second question, once we get past weighing, is whether California, in fact, did do what Chapman said. Is that right?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: --the defendant, instead of on the prosecutor for the harmless error inquiry?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: --so, in this... or, weren't there previous California cases... or, again, correct me if I'm wrong... where California says the reasonable possibility test requires the defendant to establish that the error was prejudicial? I thought that was the California law. Or am I wrong?\n",
      "David H. Souter: --don't we assume that the court follows California law on the... on the burden? And isn't it clear that, under California law, the burden is on the defendant?\n",
      "David H. Souter: I know there is no discussion of burden. But when there is no discussion of burden, isn't the reasonable assumption for us to make, as a reviewing Court, the assumption that the California Supreme Court followed its own law, and its own law is that the burden is on the defendant?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: --May I ask you one quick question, if you can comment... the statute expressly says, \"They shall impose a sentence of death if the trier of fact concludes that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances. \" How do you respond to that? Why is it not a \"weighing\" State when it says that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Antonin Scalia: Ms. Rivkind, I really don't understand what harm is done here. I can understand you're saying that there is harm done when a statute says, \"The jury shall weigh the aggravating circumstances. \" which are... have been specified and which are narrowing circumstances; there are only five named in the statute... \"shall weigh the aggravating circumstances found to be true against the mitigating. \" and it turns out that one of those five aggravating circumstances is unconstitutional. Okay? Then you have the jury weighing something that it shouldn't have weighed, because that aggravating circumstance was bad. I don't see why any harm is done where you have a statute that lists aggravating factors, one of which is \"heinous, atrocious, or cruel. \" and that is later found invalid by the State supreme court. But then, in the weighing process, the jury is told, \"Don't just weigh aggravating factors, weigh all of the circumstances of the crime. \" Now, it seems to me that the same jury that erroneously found, as one of the aggravating factors, \"heinous, atrocious, and cruel. \" would also have found that \"heinousness, atrociousness, and cruelty. \" to be one of the circumstances to be weighed. So, what harm is done?\n",
      "David H. Souter: Okay, but aren't we in, sort of, the converse situation here? There isn't any question about the admissibility of evidence that shouldn't otherwise have come in. I thought your argument here is, the error proceeds from the fact that, by using this label... by referring to the circumstance as a \"special circumstance\", having been found at the eligibility stage... that circumstance, and all the evidence that might support it, is given extra weight, and that's where the thumb on the scale comes. Isn't that your point here?\n",
      "David H. Souter: But that's what I thought I was trying to say. I mean, am I getting it wrong? Because this is the--\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Are you saying... because this can get pretty complex... simply, that because special circumstances are a discreet category, that, in effect, what went... what the court is instructing is double counting that factor? It's a factor in all the circumstances how the... how the crime was committed is a factor of all circumstances; and then, in addition, it is a special circumstance. So it is, in effect, counted twice. Is that the essence of your argument?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.: --decision, where, as I read it, it says juries don't give special circumstances any extra weight in considering all the variety of factors listed in the statute?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: The word \"special circumstances\" is ambiguous, because it might refer to something in the world, in which case it's about evidence, or it might refer to something in the law, in which case it's a statement by a prosecutor to look at some of this evidence and give it some special weight. Now, that what's confusing me throughout. As I understood this area, to go back to what Justice Scalia was saying... no, wait, just... I'll back up to try to get you to correct my misunderstanding... Zant is the key, because Zant says, \"Judge, if you have a \"nonweighing\" State. \" --that is, everything's relevant but the kitchen sink... \"the fact that the prosecutor made a mistake at the eligibility stage by including something he shouldn't is beside the point. \" Is that right?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Fine. Then we look at Stringer and Clemons, and they're making exceptions to Zant. And they're making exceptions for \"weighing\" States. So, even if the evidence in all three cases is identical and it made no difference to the evidence... that is, to what really happened in the world... still, says Clemons and Stringer... still, you're not home free yet, State. Rather, you have to back up and do harmless error analysis. So, the answer, I think, to Justice Scalia, if I understand it, is, Justice Scalia, you may be right, maybe all this is harmless, but we don't have before us the product of harmless error analysis, because you didn't grant cert on it, among other reasons. Now, if I'm right so far, and if we want to straighten all this out, why not go back and say all three cases are wrong? What you really ought to do is say, \"Court, always conduct harmless error analysis. \" \"Conduct it whether you're in \"nonweighing\", conduct it whether you're in \"weighing\", we'll simplify. \" Now, what would be so terrible about that?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But isn't it the California Supreme Court that has to do the harmless error, in the first instance? And here, this is puzzling about this case. Defendant said, at trial, to his lawyer, \"Don't argue any mitigators. \" \"I'd just as soon die as spend my life in prison. \" So, no mitigators were argued. So then, even if you have a wrong aggravator, you have other aggravators that are right, and there's nothing to weigh against those correct aggregators. So, what mitigation is there to weigh against the valid aggravators?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Well, what were those? I see that sentence. The jury--\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: --Yes, but what were the mitigating factors from the evidence presented at the guilt phase?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But now you're getting into what has sometimes been called \"residual doubt\". You point out that a juror asked, \"What if it were not unanimous? \" And you also pointed out that there was an earlier hung jury in this case. But you didn't argue, below, that residual doubt counts. It's one thing to say, \"If defendant argues it, the court should take it into account. \" But there was no such argument made in this case.\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Didn't... wasn't there a statement that he was indifferent between death and life imprisonment?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: Do you... do you defend that the difference in... our distinction between balancing and nonbalancing... or, pardon me, \"weighing\" and \"nonweighing\" States... your answer to Justice Breyer indicates the... that you would not be disconsolate if we jettisoned the whole... the whole distinction. And isn't it true that it's paradoxical that a State which tries to structure the selection phase by giving specific factors as held to a higher standard than a State that doesn't? That seems to me very odd.\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: --analysis, would you use, as one factor, the circumstance that an eligibility determination was made by the jury, was focused on by the prosecutor, and that that was impermissibly vague? Would that be a component of your harmless error analysis?\n",
      "Anthony M. Kennedy: --Well, we have the rule, already, that if there is an invalid eligibility factor and it's a \"weighing\" State, that there's... that the process is defective. Would you carry over that same argument just as one component of the harmless error analysis?\n",
      "John Paul Stevens: But in... would you clarify something? Is it the correct interpretation of the California law that the... the California court held, in effect, that you may not consider the fact that the crime was heinous and atrocious for purposes of deciding whether he's eligible for the death penalty, but you may consider that fact for the purpose of deciding whether to impose the death penalty?\n",
      "David H. Souter: No, but isn't... I want to throw you a suggestion... isn't the answer to that problem that anything may be considered as mitigating evidence, but a mitigating factor is a conclusion that evidence has a certain significance, and not everything may be taken into consideration as a mitigating factor? Isn't... the problem that Justice Scalia raises addressed by distinguishing between evidence... consider it all... and factors, a characterization of evidence which may not necessarily be considered.\n",
      "David H. Souter: Yes. I misspoke. But, I mean, the distinction between \"evidence\" and \"factor\" is the... is the key, isn't it?\n",
      "David H. Souter: All right. That means the answer to my question is yes, right?\n",
      "David H. Souter: And that was correct under the law, wasn't it? In other words, \"special circumstance\" means the same thing when it's referred to... the term means the same thing when it's referred to in the statute on selection as it means in the statute on eligibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Do you agree that such residual doubt factors are appropriately considered if the defendant didn't raise them? I mean, the question of... that, yes, the jury found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but maybe there's something that makes that determination doubtful.\n",

Now, I don't want to go. And it's not against you; it's against him. I didn't agree to that or did I? Now, I thought this is quite narrow or could be. What actually either seller did is I agreed, I signed a party and said I'll go to arbitration. And -- but the -- when you use the word \"seller,\" which I think maybe was me; is that right, your opponent, that includes subcontractors in this contract. And, by the way, you're a subcontractor. And you were listed. So it isn't exactly involuntary. Or you and I agree and I say: Our contract, including arbitration, is for the benefit of Mr. Johnson, who is a third-party beneficiary for everything including arbitration. And then the question is: Can Mr. Johnson bring me in? He didn't sign it. You signed it. Now, can't we decide it on a narrow ground like that by indeed leading up to the lower court all those questions about whether it's really true, whether it really isn't true that a third-party beneficiary can or the person listed in the seller's side can, and just say it doesn't limit it to where you're the one who wants to bring me into arbitration. They're well established legal doctrines. I don't want to make my argument for you. I want you to tell me quite straightforward -- and I'll -- in a few seconds, is that a possible argument in this case? We just send it back.\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Can you -- can we -- can we understand why Respondent should be equitably estopped? This case is going in the brief, and so far in the oral argument on a level once -- once removed from the basic facts on the ground. So what is it in this case that makes the doctrine of equitable estoppel appropriate?\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: And -- and -- even though at the time the contract was made, the subcontractors hadn't been picked, so there were -- GE was on a list of potential subcontractors, but was not, in fact, a subcontractor at the time of the arbitration agreement?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch: -- we're going well down this rabbit hole on whether equitable estoppel applies in this case. But I -- I had -- I had proceeded on maybe on the mistaken assumption that the question whether equitable estoppel is recognized as a viable theory under the Federal Arbitration Act isn't before us. The only question before us is whether anything in the convention precludes an argument like that to be made under the Federal Arbitration Act, whether or not it might succeed. Am I -- but I -- am I mistaken?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: But Mr. Dvoretzky, that -- that is the question. So let's take a look at Article II, and specifically the third sentence because the third sentence says, \"The court of a contracting state\" -- and then I'm going to skip some words -- \"shall, at the request of one of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration.\" And I have to tell you, I think that the best understanding of the term \"parties\" looking at the three sentences of Article II, let's just assume that the best understanding is the parties to the agreement. So this says the parties to the agreement are requesting the arbitration. And that's when the court should refer the arbitration. Now, that raises the question who's the party? I -- I'm with the Chief Justice. If you're talking about an alter ego or something like that, or a successor-in-interest, maybe that person counts as a party, even though it is not the signatory but there is some limit, isn't there, that is imposed by that language of \"the parties\"?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: Well, let me read you a few sentences, Mr. Dvoretzky and you tell me whether you always have to say \"shall only\" if you say \"shall.\" If I say federal courts shall have jurisdiction over federal questions, would this statute also permits those courts to exercise jurisdiction over state questions?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: Shareholders shall appoint two directors to the board. Does that mean shareholders can appoint 20 directors to the board?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: Because \"shall\" means \"shall only\" in many circumstances, right?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: Right. So I guess that brings us back to the question that Justice Alito started us off with, because I think that that's relevant to the context in which we're viewing this Convention, which is the assumption on the part of the United States Congress when it passed the FAA and surely the -- those who entered into the Convention, the Convention was a matter of -- excuse me -- that arbitration was a matter of voluntary consent. I mean, so if it's a matter of voluntary consent, and everybody thinks that that's what arbitration is, shouldn't we read \"the parties\" to be, you know, the parties? Nobody else.\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Is it -- is it necessary to go so far as to say that the Convention says nothing about what the relevant law of a particular jurisdiction says about who can enforce an arbitration agreement or could it say -- could it perhaps go beyond strictly the signatories to the agreement and encompass some other non-parties that have a sufficient -- that have a close connection, as would be the case with somebody who was equitably estopped?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: -- there are two ways to reach your result. One is to read Article II and say what you seem to be saying, which is that it only requires or compels arbitration in one circumstance but a contracting state can compel arbitration in any way that it wants, even without a written agreement. That seems to be the essence of your argument, correct?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: So assuming we're on common ground or I am, that we have some, some basis to say that contracting states can pick who parties are, what's the limiting principle after that? What's the limiting principle of equitable estoppel? It can't be every single type of equitable estoppel is okay.\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: -- back to -- to a question Justice Kagan raised? There are these privity-like people and then there's this doctrine of equitable estoppel, which we're told that many of our treaty partners do not recognize. So what you're suggesting is that we should recognize this equitable estoppel, even though our treaty partners would not, which could yield divergent results and give you a real problem at the enforcement end because a country that doesn't recognize equitable estoppel will hesitate to enforce an award that was based on that theory. So you -- you can distinguish these successors in interest, maybe assignors, privity-like people from this equitable estoppel, which is not universally embraced by our treaty partners.\n",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Before your time runs out, I'd like you to answer specifically, in the Public Citizens' brief, they cite a case called Todd v. Steamship Mutual Underwriting Association. They say a U.S. worker who was injured by his employer in Louisiana sued that insolvent insurer's -- employer's insurer under Louisiana's Direct Action Statute, and was required to arbitrate his personal injury claim before an arbitration panel in London. That sounds like a real horrible -- is -- is that the result of the position that you are pressing?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch: Counsel, I'm -- I understand that different countries may have different views about equitable estoppel or other kinds of non-signatory, non-strict consent arbitrations. Is there any disagreement among countries about how to read the Convention itself with respect to whether it creates a floor or a ceiling?\n",

      "Neil Gorsuch: Okay. So under domestic arbitration rules, there would be a real live question here?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch: But -- but for the Convention, despite the international character of this agreement, we would have a choice of law problem undoubtedly but we'd find some choice of law, look and see whether equitable estoppel is a permissible argument to be made in an arbitration case like this?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: Would this be a question under regular estoppel rules? Forget about equitable estoppel. Would they have a potential claim under estoppel rules?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: They are defined as sellers in the contract. Why wouldn't estoppel rules, not equitable rules, but mere estoppel rules make them a seller?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: You signed a contract. You agreed to arbitrate with the sellers. Sellers were defined as a list of sub -- subcontractors or sub-suppliers. They -- they were among those. Why wouldn't estoppel stop you, normal estoppel rules?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: When seller -- I'm reading the contract. When \"seller\" is mentioned, it shall be understood as subcontractors, and a million or not, included, except if expressly stated otherwise. Where in the arbitration clause are they expressly stated otherwise?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor: Who are the parties -- where does it say that subcontractors are not sellers for purposes of the arbitration clause?\n",
      "\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch: -- these are good arguments, but it -- it seems to me that it's one thing to say we're going to force all these suppliers into arbitration, compel them without their consent. That -- that would be -- that would be one -- one thing. But it's quite another to say that you -- you agree -- you agreed to this contract, where they can -- they can bring arbitration against you. And there's no consent problem there, it seems to me. You've -- you've consented -- this is the scope of your consent, we have to address, but the idea that you consented to something seems hard to dispute, isn't it, as a matter of domestic law?\n",

      "Stephen G. Breyer: So the words that he used are not privity. He would say in a thing like this, it's one of the parties or someone who stands in the shoes of a regular party, of -- of an ordinary party. Now most of what you say is consistent with that. And if you use those vaguer words, you pick up what we said in Andersen because sometimes such a person who is a non-signatory would stand in the shoes because of assumption of a contract, because it went through bankruptcy, because we pierced the corporate veil, because there's theory of alter ego, because there's an incorporation by reference, third-party beneficiary theories, waiver, and, he says, estoppel. So it sounds what we're really arguing about is this the kind of estoppel and are these the circumstances of estoppel that will put your adversary in the shoes of a party? If I am right -- and you're nodding your head, which is a good sign --\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Then you can say -- all right. Then you can say it's not right. But I -- I -- I thought that that's a question which I don't know the answer to and that, really, the Eleventh Circuit didn't use this wonderful expression, \"stand in the shoes of\" and thereby pick up the Arthur Andersen or at least some of them. Since they didn't, we could send it back and say the district court seemed to think they should, but here they're making an excellent argument on both sides. Now, now you've got my question. It's what to do with this case, depends on an assumption. What do you think?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: What do we have to decide? The -- the Eleventh Circuit said a non-signatory can never enforce, right?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: How does this concept of privity, which is, as far as I'm -- as far as I'm aware, is a feature of Anglo-American law, become the -- become the controlling standard under this international agreement?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.: Okay, well, what's the doctrine of privity under German law?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch: So -- so what do you do about -- do about that, Number 1? And Number 2, in a completely different line -- and take them as you choose, okay -- normally when we interpret treaties to bind domestic law, we require a pretty clear statement when -- when we're staying Congress's hand in an area. And if the FAA, hypothetically -- and I'm not passing on it; we don't need to -- were to allow equitable estoppel doctrine and the Convention didn't allow domestic law to do that, wouldn't we require a clearer statement than what we have here?\n",
      "Elena Kagan: So where do you get that understanding from? Because Mr. Dvoretzky, the solicitor general, says the parties to the Convention were just concerned about people not enforcing arbitration agreements. They didn't have it in mind to draw up a whole set of rules about when to and when not to. That's left up to the states. What -- what -- what's your best argument to the contrary?\n",

      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: So you have two cases, which in the best of all possible worlds because they're linked would be heard in the same forum, one going to an arbitration panel in Berlin and the other going to the state court in Alabama, but that's the result of your view of what the Convention requires?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: I'm interested in -- you want to read that sentence 3 as the ceiling. You know what I am talking about?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Yeah, but then the word \"privity\" doesn't appear there, you know, so you say almost a ceiling. No. Almost a party. No. Party plus privity. And I say: Well, now, I'm sitting here, can I think of some cases that are hard to squeeze into the term \"privity\" but it sounds as if they should be able to stand in the shoes of the party? Smith makes a contract with Jones. He says: You know, Jones, this is for the benefit of my daughter when she's 35. This will help her a lot. And I want her to be able to enforce it. And I want her to be able to go to arbitration. I love arbitration. Jones writes back to the letter: I agree with you, of course you can enforce it in arbitration. I love arbitration too. (Laughter.)\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: Don't worry. Go ahead and sign. So he signs. And now the daughter wants to go to arbitration after she's 35. Well, that's a pretty strong case for estoppel. And it's very hard to call the daughter a privity. So I've tried to think of a case where, does that sentence forbid that? No. Because you can't either call the daughter a privity, which sounds like a stretch, or you could say that is not a ceiling but it does pick up domestic law on this matter. And, by and large, when the domestic law allows a non-signatory to enforce an arbitration clause against a signatory, this doesn't forbid it. Now, what about that approach?\n",
      "Stephen G. Breyer: He had a list about a thousand miles long, it seemed to me, of authorities, cases, professors, and others who say all these other people have enforced that particular sentence in a way that it allows at least some, perhaps not all, of those who are hard to call privities to enforce under certain circumstances and this is one.

Why don't we approach this case with a... sort of a section-based contextualism, and the principle address of the section, I suppose, is to Federal sentencing and the relationships of Federal sentences, so if we're going to look at context, why don't we look at it more broadly than you would and find that a reason not to apply the any sentence reference to State sentences?\n",

Souter: --Well, I think your answer is a fair answer, but I guess I have one follow-up question to it, and that is, if there is any question about whether your answer is sort of dispositive, isn't it fair to look to the point that was brought out earlier, and that is that on your theory there's sort of a game of chance going on, because if the... in this case, for example, if the State sentence had not been imposed first, the result would be different here, and rather than allow this statute to be administered in a way that is going to turn it into a game of chance, which sentence... depending on which sentencer gets there first, why isn't it more reasonable to interpret it the way the respondents claim?\n",

So we're limited  by human attention spans. So are they. So our theories are a little hard, but let's look at Etsy. Etsy is a supermarket that wants to sell only vintage clothes, and so it is going to and does limit users' content.

They say, you know, you can't have hate speech on this site. They say you can't have misinformation with respect to particular subject matter areas. And they seem to take those rules -- I mean, you know, somebody can say maybe they  should enforce them even more than they do, but they do seem to take them seriously. They have  thousands and thousands of employees who are devoted to enforcing those rules.

I mean, I guess the hard part for me is really trying to understand how we apply this analysis at the broad level of generality that I think both sides seem to be taking here. I mean, you say what -- what is being regulated here is conduct, not speech. Well, I guess maybe if you're talking about Facebook's news  --news feed feature, but there are lots of other things that Facebook does that -- you know, that might be speech, but then there might be other things that Facebook does that doesn't qualify as speech. So don't we have to, like, drill down more in order to really figure out whether or not things are protected?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson:  No, but that's -- no, no, no. I guess what I'm saying is you mentioned the PruneYard case or the FAIR case, excuse me. I mean, we didn't say that law -- 26 schools, you know, as a categorical matter are, you know, always engaged in unprotected speech. We looked at the particular thing. This was a fair and, you know, the law school was saying,  we don't want these certain entities in it. I hear you suggesting that we can just say, you know, Facebook is a common carrier and, therefore, everything it does qualifies as conduct and not speech. And I don't think  that's really the way we've done this i n our past precedents. So can you speak to that?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson:  Not the law, the entity. What is the entity doing?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson:  -- an intersection of what the law says they can't do and what in particular hey are doing, right?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson:  All right. So what do you do about -- what do you do with LinkedIn has a virtual job fair and it has some rules about who can be involved. That seems to map on, I would think, to the FAIR case. Is that what you're saying?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch:  Mr. Whitaker, on -- on that score, so we have some -- in a facial challenge, we have a bit of a problem because different legal principles apply in different factual circumstances, and there are many different defendants or plaintiffs here, sorry, with different services. So that -- that's a complicating feature on a -- on a facial challenge. But here's another one for you:  What about Section 230, which preempts some of this law?  How much of it?  And how are we to account for that complication in a facial challenge?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further?\n",

      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I'll ask Mr. Clement that argument -- that question too. As to the platforms that are covered, where in the record would I look to find a list of all of the functions that those platforms perform?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Does your law cover any websites that primarily or even exclusively engage in non-expressive conduct?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  What is the right standard for a facial challenge if we think that your law implicates a -- a -- a portion, a percentage of expressive conduct and a portion of non -expressive conduct? How should we analyze that?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So we need a -- we need a numerator and a denominator there, I think. What -- what would they be?\n",
      "Elena Kagan:  I  --I just wanted to sort of understand your position, and I want to narrow this to the paradigmatic social media companies' sort of news feed postings, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter/X. So suppose that -- that I say -- just take this as a given, all right?  You can argue with the facts, but don't. (Laughter.)\n",
      "Elena Kagan:  Suppose that I say, for the most part, all these places say we're open for business. Post whatever you like and we'll host it. But there are exceptions to that and clearly content-based exceptions, which the companies take seriously. So let's say they say there we think that misinformation of particular kinds is extremely damaging to society -- misinformation about voting, misinformation about certain public health issues -- and so too we think that hate speech or bullying is extremely problematic. And so we are going to enforce rules against this. They're only going to apply to a small percentage of the things that people want to post. For the most part, they're open for business. But we are serious about those content-based restrictions. All right? So, in that world, why isn't that a  -- you know, a  --a -- a classic First Amendment violation for the state to come in and say, we're not allowing  -- going to allow you to enforce those sorts of restrictions even though, you know, you're basically -- it's like an editorial judgment, you're excluding particular kinds of speech?\n",
      "Elena Kagan:  So don't say what -- what I take it to be First Amendment activity. I mean, do you take it to be First Amendmen t activity?\n",
      "Elena Kagan:  Even though they're saying, yeah, we're  --we have -- we -- we are a big forum for lots of messages but not for those kinds of messages. We want to exclude those kinds of messages. Why isn't that First Amendment, a First Amendment judgment?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch:  So why wouldn't we analytically want to address that early on in these proceedings, whether in this Court or a lower court?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch:  And then just to follow up on Jus tice Kagan's line of questioning, you've analogized to common carriers and telegraphs in particular. Why is that an apt analogy here, do you think?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh:  In your opening remarks, you said the design of the First Amendment is to prevent \"suppression of speech.\"  And you left out what I understand to be three key words in the First Amendment or to describe  the First Amendment, \"by the government.\"  Do you agree \"by the government\" is what the First Amendment is targeting?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Well, in the Turner case, the intervention was, the Court emphasized, unrelated to the suppression of speech, the antitrust-type intervention there. So I'm not sure when it's related to ensuring relative voices are balanced out or there's  fairness in the speech or balance in the speech, that that is covered by Turner. Do you agree with that?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh:  What did Turner mean by \"unrelated to\" the suppression of speech?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh:  On the editorial control point, you really want to fight the idea -- and I understand -- that editorial control is the same thing as speech itself. And you've emphasized Pruneyard over and over  again. But we have a whole other line of cases, as you're aware, of course, Hurley, PG&E, Tornillo, Turner, which emphasize editorial  control as being fundamentally protected by the First Amendment. And I understood the line between Pruneyard on the one hand and those cases on the other to be whether you were involved in a speech, communications business, as opposed to a shopping center owner, which is the other side of the line. Can you respond to those cases?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh:  On the selective speech host point, I think you've made the point  to Justice Kagan that they don't eliminate much speech. But didn't we deal with that in Hurley as well and say that the mere fact that the parade organizer usually took almost all comers was irrelevant to the First Amendment interests in essentially editorial control over who participated in the parade?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett:  Mr. Whitaker, I have a question about this editorial control because, really, when it comes to platforms that are the traditional social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, you know, TikTok, Twitter/X, it all rides -- it all turns on editorial control. It seems to me that one distinction between this and FAIR is that, here, these companies are speech hosts, right?  I mean, the  law schools in FAIR were hosting job fairs for this purpose, like online recruiting. They  weren't gathering together a whole bunch of people and saying, here, present your ideas, present your posts. I mean, these social media companies are hosting speech. So why isn't that more like a newspaper in Tornillo?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett:  Is it because it's not humanized?  I mean would  --\"humanized,\" not human eyes. Is it because it could be an algorithm that says, you know, we want to have, as Justice Kagan was pointing out, terms of service, we want to have this kind of site. You know, or  -- or --or some say that, for example, TikTok might have boosted pro-Palestinian speech and reduced  -- reduced pro -Israel speech. That's a viewpoint, right?  And if you have an algorithm do it, is that not speech?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett:  Well, that's not what they're saying here. So let's  -- let's assume that what they're saying here, that they're organizing it, you know, in ways that reflect preferences, that are expressive of their terms and conditions. In that event, do you think it would be editorial control in a First Amendment sense?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett:  Well, let me just interrupt you there. I mean, Justice Sotom ayor pointed out that even though there may not be physical space constraints, there are the -- the constraints of attention, right?  They have to present information to a consumer in some sort of organized way and that there's a limited enough amount of information that the  -- the consumer can absorb it. And don't all methods of organization reflect some kind of judgment?  I mean, could you tell  --could Florida enact a law telling bookstores that they have to put everything out by alphabetical order and that they can't organize or put some things closer to the front of the store that they think, you know, their customers will want to buy?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So your argument that it's not expressive entirely depends on the hypothesis that the sorting and feed functions are solely some sort of neutral algorithm that's designed to user preference and  that they reflect no kind of policy judgment based on the platform itself?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. Let me just ask you one last question. It's about the  facial challenge aspect of this. So Florida's law so far as I can understand it is very broad, and we're talking  about the classic social media platforms, but it looks to me like it could cover Uber, it looks to me like it could cover just Google search engines, Amazon web service, and all of those things would look very different. And, you know, Justice Sotomayor brought up Etsy. It seems to me that they're arguing  -- now Etsy has a feed recommended for you, right, but it also just has shops for handmade goods that you can get. It looks a lot more like a brick-and-mortar marketplace or flea market, you know, than, you know, a place for hosting speech. Okay?  So, if this is a facial challenge and Florida's law indeed is broad enough to cover a lot of this conduct which is farther away from expression than these standard social media platforms, why didn't you then in your brief  kind of defend it by pointing out, look, there's all this other stuff that's perfectly fine that Florida covers. We don't want, you know, some person who wants to sell their goods on Etsy to be suppressed because it's, you know,  stuff -- handmarked -- handmade goods that express a political view, for example.\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett:  -- if we agree with you that Etsy, it's fine for it to apply to, or Uber, it's fine, you know, Amazon web services, if we agreed with you with all that, is that enough to just say, well, then this facial challenge can't succeed?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson:  So I feel like there's a lot of indeterminacy in this set of facts and in this circumstance, as Justice Alito tried to, I think, illuminate with his questions. We're not quite sure who it covers. We're not clear exactly how  these -- these platforms work. One of the things I wanted to give you the chance to address is the lack of clarity about what the statute necessarily means. You've given a couple of  --you've talked about the consistency provision, for example, and you've represented what you think it means, but we don't have a state court determination interpreting that provision, do we?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson:  Can I ask you, do you think this statute could be susceptible to multiple interpretations?  I mean, I can imagine  even the consistency provision, you know, well, what does it mean that they have to do this consistently?  They have t o apply the same standards, or it has to substantively result in the same level of preference?  I could imagine there you -- you could interpret that both more  narrowly or broadly.\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson:  All right. Well, let me ask you this about that, all right?  So let's assume we get to the point we disagree with you about whether or not expressive activity is covered and we're actually applying or trying to determine which standard applies, that is, you know, level of scrutiny. What I'm a little confused about is how we evaluate, for example, the 30-day restriction with respect to determining whether it's content-based or content-neutral. I appreciate that on its face it doesn't particularly  --you know, it doesn't point to a particular type of content -- content, but I suppose it's applied in reference to content, right?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson:  I mean, that  -- that restriction is a regulated entity can only change its rules, terms, and engagements once every 30 days. But we would have to look at what it was before and what it is now to determine if there's a change, so is that a content-based restriction or not?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson:  I understand. But, in the application of even the consistency provisions, to determine whether they're not doing it consistently, aren't we also looking at content to some extent?  I mean, I just --\n",
      "\n",
      "Clarence Thomas:  Mr. Clement, if the government did what your clients are doing, would that be government speech?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas:  -- can you give me one example of a case in which we have said the First Amendment protects the right to censor?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas:  And the argument under Section 230 has been that you're merely a conduit, which it  -- exact --that was the case back in the '90s and perhaps the early 2000s. Now you're saying that you are engaged in editorial discretion and expressive conduct. Doesn't that seem to undermine your Section 230 arguments?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson:  Mr. Clement, can I ask you about the facial nature of this? Because my understanding is that, to strike down this statute as facially unconstitutional, we would have to conclude that there's no possible  way for this law to govern these entities and their conduct. So, first, do I have the standard right?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson:  But, I mean, whose burden is that?  I thought it was your burden to say that this statute, in almost all of its applications or in most or a substantial number or something, would be unconstitutional in order to get it facially stricken.\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson:  But  --but wait. I -- I just -- I don't understand. I'm sorry. So no application, but we have so many different applications of the law in this situation precisely because it is so broad. So how  -- how can you say that?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So does Gmail have a Fir st Amendment right to delete, let's say, Tucker Carlson's or Rachel Maddow's Gmail accounts if they don't agree with her -- his or her viewpoints?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, if they don't, then how are we going to judge whether this law satisfies the -- the requirements of either Salerno or overbreadth?\n",
      "Elena Kagan:  How could  --how could that be, Mr. Clement?  It's not unconstitutional to distinguish on the basis of bigness, right?\n",
      "Elena Kagan:  If you -- you're saying, if -- if -- if there were no issue here of  -- that this is really a subterfuge, they were trying to get at a certain kind of media company that  --because of their views, and the only issue was it's not worth it to regulate a lot of small sites, you know, we -- we only want to go after the big sites that actually have  many millions of users, you think that's a First Amendment violation?\n",
      "Elena Kagan:  Right, but I took that out of the -- the question. Let's say that they weren't going after these companies because of bias or because they thought they had a slant. It was just, you know, we're going after the biggest companies because those are the companies with the biggest impact and the most number of users. How  --how could that be a First Amendment violation?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.:  --is there any aspect of the service provided on the social platforms that is not protected under the First Amendment or  that is plainly valid under the First Amendment?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch:  So, Mr. Clement, the government says your brief sometimes errs in suggesting that conduit-type activity is always expressive. And direct messages, Gmail, I take  it your view then is that providers can discriminate on the basis of political views, religious beliefs, maybe even race?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch:  That it has something to do with religion or politics or race, you can editorialize and use that editorial power to suppress that speech, right?\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch:  So the answer is yes, we can  -- we can delete emails, we can delete direct messages that we don't agree with based on politics, religion, or race?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  -- does the -- does the Florida law apply to Uber?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So you've told us that it's okay for your clients to discriminate on the basis of viewpoint in the provision of email  services or in allowing direct messages, messages from one Facebook user to another on -- on a private facility. How about Uber discriminating on the basis of viewpoint with respect to people that its drivers will pick up?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett:  But, Mr. Clement, that's cut -- one of the things that's hard for me about this case is let's posit that I agree with you about Facebook and YouTube and those -- those core social media platforms. Don't we have to consider these questions Justice Alito is raising about DMs and Uber and Etsy because we have to look at the statute as a whole?  And, I mean, we don't have a lot of briefing on this, and this is  a sprawling statute and it makes me a little bit nervous. I'm not sure I agree with you about DMs  and -- and Gmail, just it -- it's not obvious to me anyway that that -- that they would -- that they can't qualify as common carriers.\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, if that's the case, Mr. Clement, to what extent is it the -- is it the result of your own litigation decisions?  You could have brought an as-applied challenge limited to the two platforms that you want to talk about, Facebook and YouTube. But, instead, you brought a facial challenge and you claim that it's also susceptible to analysis under overbreadth. So you had to -- to get a preliminary injunction,  you had to show you had a probability of success on your facial or overbreadth challenge.\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Did you bring an as-applied challenge? MR. CLEMENT. No, we didn't bring an as-applied challenge because we think this --\n",
      "Neil Gorsuch:  And so, again, you think all of the applications are unconstitutional, right?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson:  Can I try it another way?  I mean, I -- I asked you before what was the standard, and now you're saying that you think that all applications are unconstitutional, which I think is your burden to establish. So, if we come up with some scenarios in this context in which we can envision it not being unconstitutional, why don't you lose?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Thank you, counsel. Just so I understand precisely, your position is that the only issue before us is whether or not the speech that is regulated qualifies as  --not to beg the question -- the expression that's before us is not speech?\n",
      "John G. Roberts, Jr.:  If  -- if the appropriate standard is not Salerno, could you articulate what you think is the appropriate standard?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas:  Could you again explain to me why, if you win here, it does not present a Section 230 problem for you?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas:  So what is it that you are editing out that fits under Section 230?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas:  Well, I think you'd make  that, the ejusdem doctrine, do a lot of work. But let's put that aside. Tell me again what the expressive conduct is that, for example, YouTube engages in when it  -- it -- it -- or, I'm sorry, Twitter deplatforms someone. What is the expressive conduct and to whom is it being communicated?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas:  How would you know someone's been deplatformed?  Is there a notice?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas:  Is there any distinction between action or editing that takes place as a result of an algorithm as opposed to an individual?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas:  Well, but what do you do with if it's a deep -learning algorithm which teaches itself and has very little human intervention?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas:  So who's speaking then, the algorithm or the person?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas:  Yeah, and finally  -- I'm sorry to keep going, Mr. Clement -- exactly what are they saying?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas:  What is the algorithm saying?  I don't know. I'm not on any, you know. But what is it saying?\n",
      "Clarence Thomas:  Is it a consistent message?  What  --I mean, usually -- when we had Hurley, the  -- it was their parade and they didn't want certain people in their parade. You understood that. What are they saying here?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  There's a lot of new terminology bouncing around in these cases, and just out of curiosity -- and one of them is content moderation. Could you define that for me?\n",
      "Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Is it  --is it anything more a euphemism for censorship?  Let me just ask you this:  If somebody in 1917 was prosecuted and thrown in jail for opposing U.S. participation in World War I, was that content moderation?\n",
      "Sonia Sotomayor:  Mr. Clement, I'm -- I'm now sort of trying to take all of this in, and I think that I came into this very differently than you have. I came into this thinking there are different functionalities by websites. So some host news, like the news feed in Facebook. Some host  -- like Justice Barrett was talking about and others, Gmail or -- where they're just letting people contact each other, direct messaging. And I was thinking that since I think rightly this law seems to cover all of that, that it's so broad, how  -- but it might have some plainly legitimate sweep, it might be okay to require direct messaging to give you notice, to be consistent, to pay attention to 30-day registration. Some of these provisions might be okay for those functions. But you're saying to me that's not true. Can you articulate very succinctly why  you think, at this stage on a facial challe nge, that we can say there is no plainly legitimate sweep, that this particular law, after we sort it all out below, will still survive?  Now, I think the Court below said -- and you try to take that out from Justice Kagan's answer -- maybe I don't want to, okay, is it because this law was passed with viewpoint discrimination in mind?  That's what the court below said.\n",
      "Elena Kagan:  Let me ask the  -- the same kind of question in a different way. Suppose that, instead of this law, you -- you  -- you had a law that was focused, it excluded the kind of curated news feeds, where your argument about editorial discretion sort of leaps out. So this law didn't touch those. But it said, you know, with respect to Gmail and direct messaging and Venmo and Dropbox and Uber, with respect to all of those things, a site could not discriminate on the basis of  viewpoint, just as maybe a site couldn't discriminate on the basis of race or sex or sexual orientation or what have you. So it just added viewpoint to the list. Wouldn't that be all right?\n",
      "Elena Kagan:  Well, do you think that  --you know, suppose it didn't say viewpoint; it just said you can't discriminate on the basis of, you know, all the usual protected characteristics. Is that all right?\n",
      "Elena Kagan:  And that's  -- and -- and  --and that gives you your plainly legitimate sweep. Because all it's saying is  when you run a service where you're not speaking, unlike in Facebook feed, where you're editorial discretion argument is good because the  -- the -- the platform is engaged in speech activities. Well, when you're running Venmo, you're not engaged in speech activities. And so  when a state says to you, you know what, you have to serve everybody, irrespective of whether you li ke their political opinions or not, then it seems you have a much less good argument, but this statute also says that, doesn't it?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then on the procedural posture, I think this is important to try to understand what's exactly before us, and you've gotten questions on this but I want to nail it down for my benefit, which is, you said that they came in and opposed a PI solely on the ground that what was involved here was not expressive activity or speech but, instead, conduct. Is that accurate?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh:  So if we think that the statute does target expressive activity in some respects, and we affirm in this case, what is left to Justice Gorsuch's question? What's left to happen -- that just means it can't go in place for the next year or two until a final judgment. What -- what will happen in the litigation?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh:  If it came back to us or it goes to the court of appeals. And what will happen  -- I mean, you've alluded to it, but what will happen in that year, do you think? Because I don't think we've heard much about exactly what you're concerned about. In other words, you're very concerned about this. That's obvious. But what -- what  are the specifics of that?\n",
      "Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Could you just say a word about the word \"consistency,\" what you think that entails?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett:  -- without having to canvass whether all of those things would be within the plainly legitimate sweep?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson:  So, Mr. Clement, I just want to push back for a minute on the private versus public distinction. I mean, I -- I think we agree that the government couldn't make editorial judgments about who can speak and what they can say in the public square. But what do you do with the fact that now, today, the Internet is the public square? And I appreciate that these companies are private companies, but if the speech now is occurring in this environment, why wouldn't the same concerns about censorship apply?\n",
      "Ketanji Brown Jackson:  Let me just ask you about the illegitimate sweep point. So what is illegitimate about a government regulation that attempts to require these companies to apply consistently their procedures?  I don't  --I guess I don't understand why the enforcement of sort of antidiscrimination principles is illegitimate.\n",
