Maley<\/speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The prevailing party is the party who wins the lawsuit, obtaining a final judgment in its favor, or at least a party who obtains a ruling that the defendant is liable on the merits of one or more claims, such as a summary judgment or a judgment as a matter of law. A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds. It provid es no enduring relief. By its nature, it is a temporary procedural order that dissolves upon final judgment. A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies. Legal dictionaries at the time Congress enacted Section 1988 defined  \"prevailing party\" based on whether the party had successfully maintained its claim, looking to the end of the suit, not on its degree of success at earlier stages. This Court's precedent similarly provides that liability for fees and liability on the merits go hand in hand. The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party.

But there are situations in which a court does not enter a final judgment, but we would still say that a party has prevailed. For example, in a class action, the court certifies a class, but then the parties settle. We would still say that the plaintiff has prevailed. So I'm not sure that your definition of \"prevailing party\" is the only one.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not sure that that's correct. There are times when we do say that a preliminary injunction is final, not for all purposes, but for some purposes. For example, a preliminary injunction can be immediately appealed. And if it is immediately appealed, we have said that it's final for purposes of appeal. So I don't know that we can say that a preliminary injunction is never final.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not sure that I understand your point. I think that there is a difference between a court saying a preliminary injunction is never final, which is what you're saying, but it is final for some purposes, like an immediate appeal. And I think that that's a different statement than saying that it's not final for purposes of determining whether a party has prevailed.

And, here, we have a judgment on the merits. It's a preliminary judgment, but it's a judgment on the merits. So I'm not sure why you're fighting that. And, secondly, I'm not sure why it matters. I'm not sure what the difference is between a preliminary injunction that's entered, a permanent injunction that's entered, or a judgment of dismissal that's entered. All of them are judgments on the merits. So what's the difference?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  I think, with respect to the first, we're not saying that it's not a judgment on the merits. We're saying that it's not a final judgment on the merits, and that's the critical distinction. And that's what the Court said in Buckhannon. And I think that that's the distinction that this Court has drawn in the other cases, including in the context of a preliminary injunction. And I think that's consistent with the way that the Court has looked at it in other contexts, for example, in the qualified immunity context, where the Court has said that a preliminary determination of a qualified immunity claim is not a final determination that can be appealed. So I think that's the critical distinction. And I think, with respect to the second question, I think that there are different types of judgments. I mean, there's a preliminary determination, a final determination, and there's a determination that's not really a determination on the merits at all, which is what we have here. I mean, the case became moot. And so, when a case becomes moot, there is no determination on the merits. And this Court has said that in cases like DeFunis and Laidlaw, where it has said that a case that becomes moot is not a determination on the merits. And I think that that's the critical point here. And I think that the other point is that the Court has said that a preliminary injunction is not a final determination on the merits. And I think that that's the critical distinction. And I think that that's why the Court in Sole v. Wyner said that a preliminary injunction is not a final judgment and, therefore, it's not a basis for a fee determination. And I think that that's the critical distinction here.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So you're -- you're -- you're -- you're not arguing that a preliminary injunction is never a final judgment on the merits?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  I -- I -- I -- I -- I -- I think it's not a final judgment on the merits in the sense that it's not a final judgment at all. I mean, it's a preliminary determination, and that's not a final judgment. And I think that's what this Court has said in other contexts, that a preliminary determination is not a final judgment. And I think that's why the Court in Sole v. Wyner said that a preliminary injunction is not a final judgment and, therefore, it's not a basis for a fee determination. And I think that that's the critical distinction here.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Mr. Yang, I guess I'm not sure I understand your argument. So, as I understand it, you're saying that a preliminary injunction is never a final judgment on the merits. Is that right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  And -- and -- and you're saying that because it's preliminary, is that right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  I think it's not final because it's preliminary.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I mean, that's what I thought you were saying, that it's preliminary, it's not final, and, therefore, it's not a judgment on the merits. Is that right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Okay. So then why isn't a permanent injunction also not a judgment on the merits?  In other words, there are going to be appeals in that kind of case too, right?  So that's not final either, is it?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  Well, I think that at the end of the day, when there's a final judgment, that is a final judgment on the merits. And, here, there was a final judgment, but it was a judgment of dismissal on the basis of mootness. And this Court has said that a dismissal on the basis of mootness is not a judgment on the merits. And so I think that that's the critical distinction here.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <\/text>\n        <text>Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I guess I don't understand your answer, Mr. Yang, so if I could just give you a -- a hypothetical. Suppose that there's a permanent injunction entered and the case goes up on appeal and the court of appeals says we're going to affirm the permanent injunction, and then by the time the court of appeals issues its opinion, the case has become moot. Now there's a final judgment, but it's a judgment on the merits or not?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  I think, in that case, it would be a final judgment on the merits. And the reason --<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Even though it's not final with respect to anything because the case is moot?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  Well, I think, in that case, it would be final because the court of appeals would have resolved the merits of the case. And I think that's the critical distinction. And that's why I think it's important to recognize that a preliminary injunction is not a final judgment on the merits. It's a preliminary determination that there's a likelihood of success on the merits, but it's not a final determination.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Thank you, Mr. Yang.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I do have a couple of questions. First, on the mootness point, we often have cases that come to us where the case has become moot, but we decide them because they're capable of repetition yet evasive of review. Why -- why shouldn't we do that here?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  I -- I -- I think that the Court can certainly decide the case if it wishes to. I think that the mootness question goes to whether there is any effect of the judgment. And I think that the judgment here has no effect because the Court entered a judgment of dismissal on the basis of mootness.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <\/text>\n        <text>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  But that's -- that's the issue we'd have to decide, and it's an issue of law and one that's -- that's important, as your -- your colleagues point out, to other persons. So that seems a substantial issue that we could decide, and we decide legal issues all the time.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  Well, I think that there's no effect of the judgment. And I think that that's the critical point. And I think that the reason why is because the Court entered a judgment of dismissal on the basis of mootness. And this Court has said that a dismissal on the basis of mootness is not a judgment on the merits.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Fair enough. So that's -- that's an issue of law. We can decide that issue of law, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  I think the Court can decide that issue of law. I think that the Court should exercise its discretion not to because there's no effect of the judgment.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <\/text>\n        <text>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  So we can decide it?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  You can decide it, yes.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And then, on the merits of that, do you -- do you agree that a preliminary injunction is a judgment?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  I think that it is a judgment, but it's not a final judgment. And I think that's the critical point.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <\/text>\n        <text>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Well, let's put that aside. Is it a judgment?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  It is a judgment, but it is not a final judgment.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Is it a judgment?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  It is a judgment.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And is it a judgment on the merits?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  It is a preliminary judgment on the merits, but it's not a final judgment on the merits.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And -- and so a preliminary judgment on the merits is not a judgment on the merits?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  It is not a final judgment on the merits.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I didn't ask that. I did ask whether a preliminary judgment on the merits is a judgment on the merits.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  It is a preliminary judgment on the merits. It is not a final judgment on the merits.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  It is a preliminary judgment on the merits?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  It is a preliminary judgment on the merits, but it's not a final judgment on the merits.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <\/text>\n        <text>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. So it's a preliminary judgment on the merits. And, therefore, it is a judgment on the merits?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  No, it is not a final judgment on the merits. And I think that that's the critical point.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  No, no, no. Is a preliminary judgment on the merits a judgment on the merits?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  It is a preliminary judgment on the merits. It's not a final judgment on the merits.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I got that, counsel. Is a preliminary judgment on the merits a judgment on the merits?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A.

It is not a final judgment on the merits.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I -- I -- I understand, counsel.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A.

All of them are judgments on the merits. So what's the difference?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  I think, with respect to the first, we're not saying that it's not a judgment on the merits. We're saying that it's not a final judgment on the merits, and that's the critical distinction. And that's what the Court said in Buckhannon. And I think that that's the distinction that this Court has drawn in the other cases, including in the context of a preliminary injunction. And I think that's consistent with the way that the Court has looked at it in other contexts, for example, in the qualified immunity context, where the Court has said that a preliminary determination of a qualified immunity claim is not a final determination that can be appealed. So I think that's the critical distinction. And I think, with respect to the second question, I think that there are different types of judgments. I mean, there's a preliminary determination, a final determination, and there's a determination that's not really a determination on the merits at all, which is what we have here. I mean, the case became moot. And so, when a case becomes moot, there is no determination on the merits. And this Court has said that in cases like DeFunis and Laidlaw, where it has said that a case that becomes moot is not a determination on the merits. And I think that that's the critical point here. And I think that the other point is that the Court has said that a preliminary injunction is not a final determination on the merits. And I think that that's the critical distinction. And I think that that's why the Court in Sole v. Wyner said that a preliminary injunction is not a final judgment and, therefore, it's not a basis for a fee determination. And I think that that's the critical distinction here.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So you're -- you're -- you're -- you're not arguing that a preliminary injunction is never a final judgment on the merits?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  I -- I -- I -- I -- I -- I think it's not a final judgment on the merits in the sense that it's not a final judgment at all. I mean, it's a preliminary determination, and that's not a final judgment. And I think that's what this Court has said in other contexts, that a preliminary determination is not a final judgment. And I think that's why the Court in Sole v. Wyner said that a preliminary injunction is not a final judgment and, therefore, it's not a basis for a fee determination. And I think that that's the critical distinction here.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Mr. Yang, I guess I'm not sure I understand your argument. So, as I understand it, you're saying that a preliminary injunction is never a final judgment on the merits. Is that right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  And -- and -- and you're saying that because it's preliminary, is that right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  I think it's not final because it's preliminary.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I mean, that's what I thought you were saying, that it's preliminary, it's not final, and, therefore, it's not a judgment on the merits. Is that right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Okay. So then why isn't a permanent injunction also not a judgment on the merits?  In other words, there are going to be appeals in that kind of case too, right?  So that's not final either, is it?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  Well, I think that at the end of the day, when there's a final judgment, that is a final judgment on the merits. And, here, there was a final judgment, but it was a judgment of dismissal on the basis of mootness. And this Court has said that a dismissal on the basis of mootness is not a judgment on the merits. And so I think that that's the critical distinction here.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <\/text>\n        <text>Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I guess I don't understand your answer, Mr. Yang, so if I could just give you a -- a hypothetical. Suppose that there's a permanent injunction entered and the case goes up on appeal and the court of appeals says we're going to affirm the permanent injunction, and then by the time the court of appeals issues its opinion, the case has become moot. Now there's a final judgment, but it's a judgment on the merits or not?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  I think, in that case, it would be a final judgment on the merits. And the reason --<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Even though it's not final with respect to anything because the case is moot?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  Well, I think, in that case, it would be final because the court of appeals would have resolved the merits of the case. And I think that's the critical distinction. And that's why I think it's important to recognize that a preliminary injunction is not a final judgment on the merits. It's a preliminary determination that there's a likelihood of success on the merits, but it's not a final determination.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Thank you, Mr. Yang.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I do have a couple of questions. First, on the mootness point, we often have cases that come to us where the case has become moot, but we decide them because they're capable of repetition yet evasive of review. Why -- why shouldn't we do that here?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  I -- I -- I think that the Court can certainly decide the case if it wishes to. I think that the mootness question goes to whether there is any effect of the judgment. And I think that the judgment here has no effect because the Court entered a judgment of dismissal on the basis of mootness.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <\/text>\n        <text>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  But that's -- that's the issue we'd have to decide, and it's an issue of law and one that's -- that's important, as your -- your colleagues point out, to other persons. So that seems a substantial issue that we could decide, and we decide legal issues all the time.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  Well, I think that there's no effect of the judgment. And I think that that's the critical point. And I think that the reason why is because the Court entered a judgment of dismissal on the basis of mootness. And this Court has said that a dismissal on the basis of mootness is not a judgment on the merits.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Fair enough. So that's -- that's an issue of law. We can decide that issue of law, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  I think the Court can decide that issue of law. I think that the Court should exercise its discretion not to because there's no effect of the judgment.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <\/text>\n        <text>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  So we can decide it?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  You can decide it, yes.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And then, on the merits of that, do you -- do you agree that a preliminary injunction is a judgment?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  I think that it is a judgment, but it's not a final judgment. And I think that's the critical point.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <\/text>\n        <text>Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Well, let's put that aside. Is it a judgment?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  It is a judgment, but it is not a final judgment.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Is it a judgment?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A.

Yang:  It is a preliminary judgment on the merits, but it's not a final judgment on the merits.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And -- and so a preliminary judgment on the merits is not a judgment on the merits?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  It is not a final judgment on the merits.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I didn't ask that. I did ask whether a preliminary judgment on the merits is a judgment on the merits.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  It is a preliminary judgment on the merits. It is not a final judgment on the merits.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  It is a preliminary judgment on the merits?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A.

So it's a preliminary judgment on the merits. And, therefore, it is a judgment on the merits?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A.

Is a preliminary judgment on the merits a judgment on the merits?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Anthony A. Yang:  It is a preliminary judgment on the merits.

I mean, there's a preliminary determination, a final determination, and there's a determination that's not really a determination on the merits at all, which is what we have here. I mean, the case became moot. And so, when a case becomes moot, there is no determination on the merits.

And I think that the other point is that the Court has said that a preliminary injunction is not a final determination on the merits. And I think that that's the critical distinction.

It says damages that flow from the injury.  And I think you're saying that the only injury is a property injury.  Am I right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right.  So, if it's a property injury, then the damages that flow from it are property damages.

Why can't the damages that flow from it be property damages?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if the injury is a personal injury, you're saying the damages can't be property damages?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Why?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's the whole point of the statute, isn't it, to provide a remedy for people who have been injured by RICO?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I -- I'm not sure I understand what that means.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's the whole point of this statute, isn't it, to give a remedy to people who have been injured by RICO?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if they've been injured by RICO, why can't they recover property damages?  They can't recover pain and suffering and emotional distress, but why can't they recover property damages?  I don't understand why the injury is the only thing that matters.  I thought the injury is what you have to prove to get to the damages.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But why?  I mean, you're saying that the only damages that are recoverable are property damages.  But the statute doesn't say that.  It says damages that flow from the injury.

We know that from the rest of the U.S. Code, the syntax of the sentence, and the plain meaning of the word \"damages.\"  So rest of  the U.S. Code, that locution, \"damages sustained,\" appears some three dozen times in the U.S. Code. It always means compensatory damages. So we point you to the example of 18 U.S.C. 2255, where victims of crime choose between liquidated damages and damages sustained. You can't choose between liquidated damages and harm. Those have to be two measures of compensation. Syntax of the rest of the sentence. The sentence says:  Recover the damages sustained. If it meant harm, you would expect it to say \"recover for the damages sustained.\" You recover for harm. You don't recover the harm. But, if it means compensatory damages, that's a perfectly sensible sentence. And, finally, the plain meaning of \"damages.\"  Every dictionary will tell you  damages is a measure of compensation, including the treatise that Petitioners cite at page 15 of their opening brief. So, absent that textual hook, the other problem with Petitioners' rule is they  still have not told you how to distinguish the human trafficking case from this case.

Prelogar<\/speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Gun Control Act imposes straightforward but essential requirements. Firearms sellers and manufacturers must mark their products with serial numbers, maintain sales records, and conduct background checks. The industry has followed those conditions without difficulty for more than half a century, and those basic requirements are crucial to solving gun crimes and keeping guns out of the hands of minors, felons, and domestic abusers. But, in recent years, companies like the Respondents here have tried to circumvent those requirements. They've begun selling firearms as easy -to-assemble kits and frames and receivers that require minimal work to be made functional. They've advertised the products, in their words, as \"ridiculously easy to assemble and dummy-proof\" and touted that you can go from opening the mail to have a fully functional gun  in as little as 15 minutes, no serial number, background check, or records required. Those untraceable guns are attractive to people who can't lawfully purchase them or  who plan to use them in crimes. As a result, our nation has seen an explosion in crimes committed with ghost guns. In the face of that public safety crisis, ATF promulgated this rule to underscore two points about the Gun Control Act's plain text. First, a weapon parts kit that can readily be converted to function as a gun with common tools, often in under an hour, is a covered firearm. Second, a product is a frame or receiver under the Act even if the buyer must drill a few holes or remove a few superfluous pieces of plastic to make it functional. Both of those points are consistent with how ATF has interpreted and implemented the Act across five decades and 11 different presidential administrations. Respondents now seek a sea change in the Act's scope. They claim that if a firearm isn't a hundred percent functional, if it's  missing just one hole that could be drilled in seconds and immediately assembled into a working gun, that product can be sold to anyone online  with no background check, no records, and no serial number. That contradicts the Act's plain text, and it also contradicts common sense. This Court should make clear that the Act regulates these products as what they are, firearms and frames and receivers of firearms.

I welcome the Court's questions.<\/text>\n\n        ### Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n        A list of questions that Justice Sonia Sotomayor is likely to ask:\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, in 1968, Congress made a very important decision. It decided to limit the regulation of firearms to those that were readily capable of firing. And that's what it said. That's what it wrote. It didn't say \"readily capable of being fired.\"  It said \"readily capable of firing.\"  And, here, you're arguing that the -- the -- the statute permits the regulation of firearms that are not readily capable of firing. That's the essence of your argument. And I think that that's a very big leap. I think the other big leap is that the statute defines \"firearm\" as a weapon from which a shot can be discharged. And, here, you're saying that it's a weapon that can be readily made to fire. That's a big leap. So why don't you tell me why we should take those two big leaps?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm sorry, but I -- I -- I -- I don't want to go back to the language. I know you want to go back to the language. The problem is that the language is not what you say it is. It's not a weapon that's readily capable of firing. It's a weapon that's readily capable of being fired. And it's not a weapon that can be readily made to fire. It's a weapon that can fire. And so I -- I think you're -- you're -- you're making assumptions in the language that's not there. And so you're asking us to go back to the original language and to change it. And I'm not sure that's our job.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's the problem, right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go to the next step. Why do you need to do this?  I mean, you have a lot of other laws that you can prosecute these people under. You have the felon-in-possession law. You have the -- the -- the use of a firearm in the commission of a crime. You have the -- the possession of a firearm by a felon. You have a lot of laws. And so why do we need this one?  And why do we need it so badly that we're going to rewrite the statute?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I understand that, but that's not the question I asked. The question I asked is why do you need this one so badly?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Why?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I -- I understand that. But why do you need this one?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I know that's the problem. I'm asking why you need this one so badly.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's the problem. You're not --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not talking about the lack of a serial number. I'm talking about the fact that you're prosecuting people under this statute for possession of a firearm, not for lack of a serial number. You're prosecuting them for possession of a firearm. And the other laws that I mentioned to you permit you to do that. So I'm asking why you need this one.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I know that. But you're not using this law to prosecute people for not having a serial number. You're using this law to prosecute people for possession of a firearm.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I know that, but you're not using this law for that purpose. You're using it for possession of a firearm. And I'm saying why do you need this law to do that when you have other laws that permit you to do it?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I know that, but you're not using it for that purpose. You're using it for the possession of a firearm, and you have other laws that do that.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not talking about felons. I'm talking about the people who are buying these guns and putting them together and using them in crimes.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why are you prosecuting them for possession of a firearm?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you're not. You're prosecuting them for possession of a firearm.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, I don't know why you're not. But I do know that there's a statute that says that you can prosecute them for possession of a firearm.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I don't disagree with you, but I'm not talking about felons. I'm talking about people who are using these guns in crimes, and they're not felons. They're using them in crimes. And you're prosecuting them for possession of a firearm. And I'm saying why are you prosecuting them for possession of a firearm when you have a statute that says use of a firearm in the commission of a crime, why don't you use that one?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm not saying you can't. I'm saying why don't you?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Why?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I don't disagree with you, counsel.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But I'm not talking about the felon-in-possession law. I'm talking about the use of a firearm in the commission of a crime.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I know you have two different crimes, and I'm asking why you're not using the use of a firearm in the commission of a crime, why you're using the possession of a firearm instead.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  No, you don't, because, to prove the possession, you have to prove the use of the firearm, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you don't have to prove the possession.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm sorry, counsel, possession is the easier one to prove.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  No, it's not, because, to prove possession, you have to prove that they used the gun.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go to the second part, which is, if you're right about the ghost guns, meaning that people are buying these guns to use them in crimes, why are you permitting the sale of these guns to minors?  Why are you permitting the sale of these guns to people who would not pass a background check?  Why are you permitting the sale of these guns to people who, by law, are not permitted to have them?  Why are you permitting the sale of these guns?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's fine, but that's the problem.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  That's the problem, counsel. I'm not talking about the people who are going to use them in crimes. I'm talking about the people who are going to use them lawfully.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But why are you permitting the sale of these guns to people who would not pass a background check?  Why are you permitting the sale of these guns to minors?  Why are you permitting the sale of these guns to people who, by law, are not permitted to have them?  That's the issue.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why are you permitting the sale of these guns to people who are not permitted to own them?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what do we do with your adversary's position that this is not a gun?  This is just a receiver. It's not a gun. It's not a frame. It's a receiver. So why don't you deal with that argument?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why is this any different than a barrel?  Why is it any different than a trigger?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's the whole problem, which is, if it's not a firearm, if it's not a frame or a receiver, what is it?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go to the second part of this, which is, assuming that you're right that this is a firearm, why do you need the serial number?  I thought the whole purpose of the serial number was so that if a gun is used in a crime, the police can trace it back to the seller of the gun, and from the seller, they can trace it back to the buyer, and they can find out who possessed the gun at any given moment. But, here, you're saying that the seller, the manufacturer of this gun, the manufacturer of the unfinished firearm, as you want to call it, is not going to have to keep a record of who they sold this to. So how does the tracing mechanism work?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's the problem, which is it's not a gun until the buyer puts it together, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's the whole point, which is the tracing mechanism doesn't work.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But it's not a gun. It's a receiver. It's a gun part.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what you're calling it, but it's not a gun. It's a receiver.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's your argument, but it's not a gun.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's your argument, but it's not a gun. It's a receiver. And it's a receiver that's sold without a background check, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So what's the difference between this receiver and a barrel or a trigger?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go to the second part of this, which is, if you're right that this is a gun, that this is a firearm, that this is a frame or a receiver, then what sense does it make to say that you don't have to keep records of the sale of this gun?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you're not.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's the problem.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not talking about --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not talking about the 1968 Act. I'm talking about the '86 Act. And the '86 Act says that you have to keep records of the sale of firearms, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why don't you have to keep records of the sale of this firearm?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not talking about the '68 Act. I'm talking about the '86 Act.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, you're saying that it's a firearm, so why don't you have to keep records of its sale?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So you're saying it's a firearm, it's a gun, it's a frame or a receiver, but you don't have to keep records of its sale?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not talking about the '68 Act. I'm talking about the '86 Act.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not talking about the '68 Act. I'm talking about the '86 Act.

So let's go to the next step. Why do you need to do this?  I mean, you have a lot of other laws that you can prosecute these people under. You have the felon-in-possession law. You have the -- the -- the use of a firearm in the commission of a crime. You have the -- the possession of a firearm by a felon. You have a lot of laws. And so why do we need this one?  And why do we need it so badly that we're going to rewrite the statute?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I understand that, but that's not the question I asked.

I'm talking about the fact that you're prosecuting people under this statute for possession of a firearm, not for lack of a serial number. You're prosecuting them for possession of a firearm. And the other laws that I mentioned to you permit you to do that. So I'm asking why you need this one.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I know that.

You're using this law to prosecute people for possession of a firearm.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I know that, but you're not using this law for that purpose. You're using it for possession of a firearm. And I'm saying why do you need this law to do that when you have other laws that permit you to do it?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I know that, but you're not using it for that purpose. You're using it for the possession of a firearm, and you have other laws that do that.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not talking about felons. I'm talking about the people who are buying these guns and putting them together and using them in crimes.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why are you prosecuting them for possession of a firearm?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you're not. You're prosecuting them for possession of a firearm.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, I don't know why you're not. But I do know that there's a statute that says that you can prosecute them for possession of a firearm.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I don't disagree with you, but I'm not talking about felons. I'm talking about people who are using these guns in crimes, and they're not felons. They're using them in crimes. And you're prosecuting them for possession of a firearm. And I'm saying why are you prosecuting them for possession of a firearm when you have a statute that says use of a firearm in the commission of a crime, why don't you use that one?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm not saying you can't. I'm saying why don't you?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Why?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I don't disagree with you, counsel.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But I'm not talking about the felon-in-possession law. I'm talking about the use of a firearm in the commission of a crime.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I know you have two different crimes, and I'm asking why you're not using the use of a firearm in the commission of a crime, why you're using the possession of a firearm instead.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  No, you don't, because, to prove the possession, you have to prove the use of the firearm, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you don't have to prove the possession.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm sorry, counsel, possession is the easier one to prove.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  No, it's not, because, to prove possession, you have to prove that they used the gun.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go to the second part, which is, if you're right about the ghost guns, meaning that people are buying these guns to use them in crimes, why are you permitting the sale of these guns to minors?  Why are you permitting the sale of these guns to people who would not pass a background check?  Why are you permitting the sale of these guns to people who, by law, are not permitted to have them?  Why are you permitting the sale of these guns?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's fine, but that's the problem.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  That's the problem, counsel. I'm not talking about the people who are going to use them in crimes. I'm talking about the people who are going to use them lawfully.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But why are you permitting the sale of these guns to people who would not pass a background check?  Why are you permitting the sale of these guns to minors?  Why are you permitting the sale of these guns to people who, by law, are not permitted to have them?  That's the issue.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why are you permitting the sale of these guns to people who are not permitted to own them?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what do we do with your adversary's position that this is not a gun?  This is just a receiver. It's not a gun. It's not a frame. It's a receiver. So why don't you deal with that argument?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why is this any different than a barrel?  Why is it any different than a trigger?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's the whole problem, which is, if it's not a firearm, if it's not a frame or a receiver, what is it?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go to the second part of this, which is, assuming that you're right that this is a firearm, why do you need the serial number?  I thought the whole purpose of the serial number was so that if a gun is used in a crime, the police can trace it back to the seller of the gun, and from the seller, they can trace it back to the buyer, and they can find out who possessed the gun at any given moment. But, here, you're saying that the seller, the manufacturer of this gun, the manufacturer of the unfinished firearm, as you want to call it, is not going to have to keep a record of who they sold this to. So how does the tracing mechanism work?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's the problem, which is it's not a gun until the buyer puts it together, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's the whole point, which is the tracing mechanism doesn't work.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But it's not a gun. It's a receiver. It's a gun part.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what you're calling it, but it's not a gun. It's a receiver.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's your argument, but it's not a gun.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's your argument, but it's not a gun. It's a receiver. And it's a receiver that's sold without a background check, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So what's the difference between this receiver and a barrel or a trigger?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go to the second part of this, which is, if you're right that this is a gun, that this is a firearm, that this is a frame or a receiver, then what sense does it make to say that you don't have to keep records of the sale of this gun?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you're not.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's the problem.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not talking about --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not talking about the 1968 Act. I'm talking about the '86 Act. And the '86 Act says that you have to keep records of the sale of firearms, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why don't you have to keep records of the sale of this firearm?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not talking about the '68 Act. I'm talking about the '86 Act.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, you're saying that it's a firearm, so why don't you have to keep records of its sale?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So you're saying it's a firearm, it's a gun, it's a frame or a receiver, but you don't have to keep records of its sale?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not talking about the '68 Act.

It decided to limit the regulation of firearms to those that were readily capable of firing. And that's what it said. That's what it wrote. It didn't say \"readily capable of being fired.\"  It said \"readily capable of firing.\"  And, here, you're arguing that the -- the -- the statute permits the regulation of firearms that are not readily capable of firing. That's the essence of your argument. And I think that that's a very big leap. I think the other big leap is that the statute defines \"firearm\" as a weapon from which a shot can be discharged. And, here, you're saying that it's a weapon that can be readily made to fire. That's a big leap. So why don't you tell me why we should take those two big leaps?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm sorry, but I -- I -- I -- I don't want to go back to the language. I know you want to go back to the language. The problem is that the language is not what you say it is. It's not a weapon that's readily capable of firing. It's a weapon that's readily capable of being fired. And it's not a weapon that can be readily made to fire. It's a weapon that can fire. And so I -- I think you're -- you're -- you're making assumptions in the language that's not there. And so you're asking us to go back to the original language and to change it. And I'm not sure that's our job.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's the problem, right?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go to the next step. Why do you need to do this?  I mean, you have a lot of other laws that you can prosecute these people under. You have the felon-in-possession law. You have the -- the -- the use of a firearm in the commission of a crime. You have the -- the possession of a firearm by a felon. You have a lot of laws. And so why do we need this one?  And why do we need it so badly that we're going to rewrite the statute?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I understand that, but that's not the question I asked.

I'm asking why you need this one so badly.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I know you have two different crimes, and I'm asking why you're not using the use of a firearm in the commission of a crime, why you're using the possession of a firearm instead.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's the whole problem, which is, if it's not a firearm, if it's not a frame or a receiver, what is it?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's the problem.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm sorry, counsel, possession is the easier one to prove.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not talking about felons. I'm talking about the people who are buying these guns and putting them together and using them in crimes.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not talking about the '68 Act. I'm talking about the '86 Act.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's the problem, right?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I don't disagree with you, but I'm not talking about felons. I'm talking about people who are using these guns in crimes, and they're not felons. They're using them in crimes. And you're prosecuting them for possession of a firearm. And I'm saying why are you prosecuting them for possession of a firearm when you have a statute that says use of a firearm in the commission of a crime, why don't you use that one?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why is this any different than a barrel?  Why is it any different than a trigger?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I know that, but you're not using this law for that purpose. You're using it for possession of a firearm. And I'm saying why do you need this law to do that when you have other laws that permit you to do it?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, in 1968, Congress made a very important decision. It decided to limit the regulation of firearms to those that were readily capable of firing. And that's what it said. That's what it wrote. It didn't say \"readily capable of being fired.\"  It said \"readily capable of firing.\"  And, here, you're arguing that the -- the -- the statute permits the regulation of firearms that are not readily capable of firing. That's the essence of your argument. And I think that that's a very big leap. I think the other big leap is that the statute defines \"firearm\" as a weapon from which a shot can be discharged. And, here, you're saying that it's a weapon that can be readily made to fire. That's a big leap. So why don't you tell me why we should take those two big leaps?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I -- I understand that. But why do you need this one?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go to the second part of this, which is, assuming that you're right that this is a firearm, why do you need the serial number?  I thought the whole purpose of the serial number was so that if a gun is used in a crime, the police can trace it back to the seller of the gun, and from the seller, they can trace it back to the buyer, and they can find out who possessed the gun at any given moment. But, here, you're saying that the seller, the manufacturer of this gun, the manufacturer of the unfinished firearm, as you want to call it, is not going to have to keep a record of who they sold this to. So how does the tracing mechanism work?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not talking about the '68 Act. I'm talking about the '86 Act. The '86 Act says that you have to keep records of the sale of firearms.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Why?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But I'm not talking about the felon-in-possession law. I'm talking about the use of a firearm in the commission of a crime.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  No, it's not, because, to prove possession, you have to prove that they used the gun.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  That's the problem, counsel. I'm not talking about the people who are going to use them in crimes. I'm talking about the people who are going to use them lawfully.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what you're calling it, but it's not a gun. It's a receiver.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why are you prosecuting them for possession of a firearm?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go to the next step. Why do you need to do this?  I mean, you have a lot of other laws that you can prosecute these people under. You have the felon-in-possession law. You have the -- the -- the use of a firearm in the commission of a crime. You have the -- the possession of a firearm by a felon. You have a lot of laws. And so why do we need this one?  And why do we need it so badly that we're going to rewrite the statute?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So what's the difference between this receiver and a barrel or a trigger?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  No, you don't, because, to prove the possession, you have to prove the use of the firearm, correct?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not talking about --","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you're not.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I don't disagree with you, counsel.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm sorry, but I -- I -- I -- I don't want to go back to the language. I know you want to go back to the language. The problem is that the language is not what you say it is. It's not a weapon that's readily capable of firing. It's a weapon that's readily capable of being fired. And it's not a weapon that can be readily made to fire. It's a weapon that can fire. And so I -- I think you're -- you're -- you're making assumptions in the language that's not there. And so you're asking us to go back to the original language and to change it. And I'm not sure that's our job.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's the whole point, which is the tracing mechanism doesn't work.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm not talking about the 1968 Act. I'm talking about the '86 Act. And the '86 Act says that you have to keep records of the sale of firearms, correct?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go to the second part, which is, if you're right about the ghost guns, meaning that people are buying these guns to use them in crimes, why are you permitting the sale of these guns to minors?  Why are you permitting the sale of these guns to people who would not pass a background check?  Why are you permitting the sale of these guns to people who, by law, are not permitted to have them?  Why are you permitting the sale of these guns?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's your argument, but it's not a gun. It's a receiver. And it's a receiver that's sold without a background check, correct?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm not saying you can't. I'm saying why don't you?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why don't you have to keep records of the sale of this firearm?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I know that. But you're not using this law to prosecute people for not having a serial number. You're using this law to prosecute people for possession of a firearm.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's the problem, which is it's not a gun until the buyer puts it together, correct?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's your argument, but it's not a gun.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, you're saying that it's a firearm, so why don't you have to keep records of its sale?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But it's not a gun. It's a receiver. It's a gun part.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So you're saying it's a firearm, it's a gun, it's a frame or a receiver, but you don't have to keep records of its sale?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you're not. You're prosecuting them for possession of a firearm.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, I don't know why you're not. But I do know that there's a statute that says that you can prosecute them for possession of a firearm.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go to the second part of this, which is, if you're right that this is a gun, that this is a firearm, that this is a frame or a receiver, then what sense does it make to say that you don't have to keep records of the sale of this gun?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you don't have to prove the possession.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what do we do with your adversary's position that this is not a gun?  This is just a receiver. It's not a gun. It's not a frame. It's a receiver.

First, Congress altered the common understanding of \"firearm\" to include other  weapons that may readily be converted to firearms. Second, in a departure from prior federal law, Congress decided to regulate only a  single part of a firearm, the frame or receiver, and Congress did not alter the common understanding of a \"frame or receiver.\"  ATF has now exceeded its authority by operating outside of the bounds set by Congress. One, ATF has expanded the definition of \"frame or receiver\" to include items that may readily be converted to a frame or receiver. And, two, ATF has expanded the definition of \"firearm\" to include collections of parts that are not weapons and that do not include a frame or receiver. Some concern has been raised about circumvention, but, of course, complying with a statute is not circumventing it. And as this Court said in Abramski, which has already been referenced, Congress, in the Gun Control Act,  did not seek to pursue its purposes of controlling access to firearms to the nth degree. And, notably, Congress did not regulate the secondary market for firearms, and that secondary market is a much bigger source of firearms for criminals than privately made firearms. There also has been questions raised about the agency's prior practice. There definitely has been a sea change by the agency here. The agency projected that its rule would put 42 out of 43 unlicensed manufacturers out of business. And what the agency said in the Syracuse litigation was they said:  \"An unfinished frame or receiver does not meet the statutory definition of 'firearm' simply because it can be designed to or can readily be converted into a frame or receiver.\"  That's the exact standard t hey've now adopted. Instead, what they looked at was whether critical machining operations had taken place. And, to be clear, we have no quarrel with that prior practice. We have raised as alternatives, one, something has to be  completely machined, or, two, the critical machining operation test. And the -- the latter, we submit, is more consistent with the statutory language and solves the machine gun problem because, if you say, in the machine gun provision, a frame or receiver is also regulated, and if one hole is all that separates a semi-automatic receiver from a machine gun receiver, it's hard to see how the \"readily\" standard would not also be applied there.

Shanmugam<\/speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Ninth Circuit has adopted an outlying rule that threatens to create a sweeping regime of securities liability for omissions. The Ninth Circuit held that a risk disclosure can be misleading  simply because a company does not disclose that the specified triggering event for the risk had occurred in the past. That holding was incorrect. A risk disclosure warrants that a type of event may cause harm in the future. It usually makes no representation that the event had never previously occurred. The Ninth Circuit's approach would trigger serious concerns about over-disclosure and fraud by hindsight, and this Court should reject it. Instead, the Court should adopt a similar approach to the one it took for statements of opinion in Omnicare. There, the Court held that statements of opinion were  ordinarily not actionable as false statements, but the Court recognized that a statement of opinion could be misleading based on an embedded representation about how the speaker formed the opinion. So too here, depending on the content of the statement, a forward-looking risk disclosure can be misleading based on an embedded premise about the current state of affairs. But just as a statement that the road may be flooded if it rains cannot be misleading simply because it rained yesterday, a typical risk disclosure cannot be misleading simply because the triggering event had occurred in the past. Under the correct approach, this case is an easy one. Meta's warnings that business harm could result in the event of data misuse did not imply that Meta had never previously suffered such misuse. But, in any event, the  initial misuse of the data had been publicly reported by the time Meta made the statements at  issue, and Respondents have abandoned any claim based on the continued misuse of the data. And  far from being virtually certain to cause a risk of harm to Meta's business, the initial misuse of the data did not result in any harm when it was publicly reported. Under any approach other than the Ninth Circuit's, Petitioners are entitled to prevail. The judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.

If it's a forward-looking statement, how can the failure to disclose a past event make the statement misleading?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Kannon K. Shanmugam:  So, Justice Sotomayor, we think that the statements are misleading because they did not disclose the Cambridge Analytica data breach. And we think that the Ninth Circuit's rule is wrong because the Ninth Circuit's rule would allow a plaintiff to plead a claim based on a statement that the road may be flooded if it rains simply because it rained yesterday. And that's why we think that the Ninth Circuit's rule is wrong.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's -- that's the question. It's not the -- you're not arguing that the statement was misleading because it rained yesterday. You're arguing that the statement was misleading because it didn't disclose that it rained yesterday. That's the question. So why is the failure to disclose a past event a misstatement that makes a forward-looking statement misleading?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Kannon K. Shanmugam:  So, Justice Sotomayor, I think that the better way to look at this is to look at the content of the statements. And we think that the statements are misleading because they did not disclose the Cambridge Analytica data breach. And the Ninth Circuit's rule is wrong because it would allow a plaintiff to plead a claim based on a statement that the road may be flooded if it rains simply because it rained yesterday. And we think that that's not the correct way to analyze the statements in this case, and we think that it's not the correct way to analyze the statements more generally.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if I'm a judge, and you're coming to me and saying I should rule in your favor because the statements were misleading because they didn't disclose a past event, why is that?  What's your legal theory for that?  I'm not asking you what you think the Ninth Circuit did wrong. I'm asking you what you think is the correct legal rule.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Kannon K. Shanmugam:  So, Justice Sotomayor, I think that the correct legal rule is that a statement can be misleading based on an embedded premise about the current state of affairs. And, here, the statements are misleading because they did not disclose the Cambridge Analytica data breach.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Thank you, counsel.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Mr. Shanmugam, I think what Justice Sotomayor is trying to do is to figure out how your theory works. And I guess I'm having the same difficulty. So, you know, take a statement like we may be exposed to cyber risk. And then the question is, when is that statement misleading?  And I would have thought that the answer is, if there's a material cyber risk, if there's a material cyber risk, then that statement is misleading. But you seem to be saying that the statement is misleading only if there's a material cyber risk and the company knows about it. And I guess I'm just wondering why that is. Like, if there's a material cyber risk and the company doesn't know about it, why is that statement not misleading?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Kannon K. Shanmugam:  So, Justice Kagan, I think that the way to think about this is to think about the content of the statement. And I think that the reason why we would look at the content of the statement is because the question is whether the statement is misleading. And so, in the ordinary case, the question is going to be, is the statement false?  And in the context of a forward-looking statement, the question is going to be, is the statement misleading?  And I think that that's the way that the Court approached this issue in Omnicare. Now, in the context of a forward- looking statement, I think that it's going to be rare that you're going to have a situation in which there is a clear embedded premise. And I think that that's the reason why the Court in Omnicare said that it's going to be rare for a statement of opinion to be actionable as a misleading statement. But I think that the same thing is true in the context of forward-looking statements. It's going to be rare for there to be a clear embedded premise.<\/text>\n        <END_Q><|eot_id|>","cleaned":"        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So if I understand you, you're not asking us to reverse the Ninth Circuit's ruling that the statements were forward-looking.

And that's why we think that the Ninth Circuit's rule is wrong.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's -- that's the question. It's not the -- you're not arguing that the statement was misleading because it rained yesterday. You're arguing that the statement was misleading because it didn't disclose that it rained yesterday.

First, as to the actual question presented, we agree that a risk disclosure is not misleading because it omits disclosure of an event that is immaterial because it risks no  business harm. The Ninth Circuit did not hold otherwise. Second, we agree that in addition to proving materiality, plaintiffs must also show  that the risk statement implies that the omitted event did not occur. We don't claim that every risk statement includes that implication. Our position is simply that they can and frequently do, and that ultimately depends on the facts and context of each case. Third, for that reason, the Court should reject Facebook's categorical rule that Item 105 statements are always agnostic about whether the risk has transpired in the past. Facebook admits that if a student tells his parents that there's a risk he may fail an exam when he's already done so, that is misleading because it implies it's impossible that he won't when that isn't true. The same is true of many risk factor statements, including the ones at issue in this case stating that the  -- describing an improper disclosure of user data as a hypothetical risk implied that it was possible it wouldn't occur. And that wasn't  possible because it already had. This does not mean that issuers must disclose every material occurrence of a risk. They simply must say enough to remove the false impression that the omitted event has not yet materialized, something they generally can do, as Facebook did here with respect to hacking, by simply acknowledging that the risk has materialized in the past. Finally, the Ninth Circuit did not adopt any contrary categorical rule. The Court did not discuss whether these particular statements were agnostic about the past because Facebook never argued that they were. It elected instead to argue only that the warned-of risks had not transpired because it viewed the warned -of risks as speaking only to hacking events and business harm. Because Facebook does not challenge the Ninth Circuit's fact-bound rejection of those claims in this Court, this Court should provide any necessary guidance for future cases in the course of affirming the judgment.

You seem to be arguing that it's a procedural rule, and that's the way I read it. But the SG says that it's an affirmative defense. Do you think the state has to say that it's an affirmative defense, or can it do what it's doing and say it's a procedural rule and not have to prove it?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  So I think the state is sort of trying to have it both ways. I think it's very clear that the state is trying to say that it's a procedural rule, and that's the basis of the statute, because it says that it's a condition precedent to the suit. And I think the state is trying to say that it's a procedural rule because it wants to say that it's not a defense that's available in federal court, and I think that's the only way that the state can make that argument. I think the state's other argument is that it's a jurisdictional rule, which is different from a procedural rule, and I think that's the argument that the state is making when it says that the court has no power to hear the case. I think the state is trying to have it both ways, but I think it's pretty clear that it's trying to say it's a procedural rule, and I think that's the only way that it can make the argument that it's not available in federal court.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if it's a procedural rule, it has to be proven by the state?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Well, I think, if it's a procedural rule, it has to be proven by the state in the sense that the state has to come forward with it, but I don't think the state has to prove it in the sense that it has to provide evidence. I think, if it's a procedural rule, the state can just raise it as a procedural rule, and then it would be up to the -- the Petitioners to respond to it. But I think it's pretty clear that the state is trying to say that it's a procedural rule.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Can I go to a second point?  The Chief Justice asked about the difference between the FTCA and 1983. I'm not sure how I see the difference. The FTCA says that the government is liable for torts committed by its employees, except for certain exceptions, and one of those exceptions is the failure to comply with any statute or regulation. So, if the state law requires exhaustion, the government is not liable. So I don't see how the government's position is any different than the state's position.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Well, I think the government's position is that the statute and regulation exception applies to the substantive cause of action. So, for example, if there's a statute or regulation that says that you have to exhaust in order to bring a negligence claim against the United States, then that statute would be applicable. But, if there's a statute that says that you have to exhaust in order to bring a claim against the Secretary of Corrections, I think the government's position is that that would not be applicable. So I think the government is trying to say that the statute and regulation exception is only applicable to the cause of action, and I think that's the difference between the government's position and the state's position.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why would you be liable if you didn't comply with the statute or regulation?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Well, I think that the government would not be liable if you didn't comply with the statute or regulation, but I think that the government is trying to say that the statute or regulation has to be a statute or regulation that applies to the cause of action.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I don't understand.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  So, for example, the statute or regulation that applies to the cause of action is the FTCA itself. So, if you have a negligence claim, the statute or regulation that applies to that is the FTCA. But, if you have a statute or regulation that applies to a claim against the Secretary of Corrections, that would not be a statute or regulation that applies to the cause of action.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So the government is saying that you can't have a procedural requirement that's not in the FTCA?  Is that what you're saying?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Yes, I think that's what the government is saying. And I think that's the difference between the government's position and the state's position.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why is this procedural requirement, this exhaustion requirement, not a procedural requirement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Because it's a procedural requirement that's applicable to a different cause of action. I think it's a procedural requirement applicable to a claim against the Secretary of Corrections, but it's not a procedural requirement applicable to the FTCA.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. I have one last question. The state court said, if you had a claim against the state, you would have been required to exhaust. You would have had to file a 1983 claim against the state, and you would have had to exhaust. So why isn't that the same thing as what they're saying here, that you have to exhaust before you can sue the Secretary?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Well, I think that the state court's position is that, if you bring a claim against the state, then you have to exhaust. But I think that that's a totally different claim. I think that the state court is trying to say that the claim against the state is a different claim from the claim against the Secretary of Corrections. And I think that's the whole point of the PLRA. I think that the PLRA is trying to say that you can bring a claim against the Secretary of Corrections, and you don't have to bring a claim against the state.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Thank you, counsel.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan?  Justice Gorsuch?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Can I ask you about the Chief Justice's question?  Do you agree with the SG that the state could say you have to prove exhaustion, and that would be fine?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  So I think that would be a -- a different question. I think that would be a question of whether the state could change the elements of the claim. I think that that would be a different question than whether the state could assert an affirmative defense, which is what it's doing here. So I think that would be a different question.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. And then, second question, to follow up on Justice Alito's question, if we agree with you that this is not jurisdictional, as I think we have to because of how it's structured, then what are the practical consequences of that in your view?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  I think the practical consequences are that the state would have to raise this affirmative defense in federal court, and it would have to prove it by a preponderance of the evidence. And I think, you know, in this case, the state, you know, had notice and an opportunity to be heard in the federal court, and the federal court held that the state hadn't met its burden. So I think that that's the practical consequence of -- of it not being jurisdictional. And I think that's a pretty big deal because I think that the state, you know, is -- is trying to get a free pass into federal court by saying that this is jurisdictional.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then, to follow up on Justice Alito's question, if we agree with you that it's not jurisdictional, it's a defense, and if we agree with you that it's not a defense that's available in federal court, then why isn't the case over and we can just remand for a trial on the merits?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  So I think that's right. I think that the -- the Eleventh Circuit's decision was based on the assumption that this was jurisdictional, and the Eleventh Circuit said that, you know, because it's jurisdictional, we have to remand to the state court. But, if this Court says that it's not jurisdictional, then I think the Eleventh Circuit's rationale disappears, and I think that the case should be remanded for trial on the merits.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Barrett?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  So, Mr. Unikowsky, I want to make sure that I understand the relationship between 1983 and the PLRA. So let's imagine that the state has a procedural rule that requires you to exhaust before you bring a 1983 claim. So, you know, you have to go to the prison's internal grievance procedure and then, you know, you can bring your 1983 claim. Okay?  So that's the state's procedural rule. And then let's imagine that the state also has a procedural rule that says you have to exhaust before you bring a claim under the PLRA. Okay?  So you have to exhaust before you bring a 1983 claim and before you bring a PLRA claim. So, if you fail to exhaust, you can't bring either claim, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Well, I think that's right. I think that the state's position is that you have to exhaust in order to bring a claim against the Secretary of Corrections. And I think that that's the -- that's the rule that's being applied in this case. And I think that that's the rule that's not available in federal court.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  But the PLRA is the one that's not available in federal court, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Well, I think that the -- the defense that the state is asserting is that you can't bring a claim against the Secretary of Corrections. And I think that that's the defense that's not available in federal court. And I think that the -- the defense that's not available in federal court is the defense that the state is trying to assert here.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. But let me just --<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  I mean, I think the -- the -- the -- the -- the defense that the state is asserting here is that you have to exhaust in order to bring a claim against the Secretary of Corrections. And I think that's the defense that's not available in federal court.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. Let me just make sure that I understand this. So the PLRA is not a cause of action. It's just a limitation on 1983, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So it's a limitation on 1983, and it says that you can't bring a 1983 claim unless you have exhausted. So it's a prerequisite to bringing the 1983 claim, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. And so the state has a procedural rule that says, if you fail to exhaust, you can't bring a 1983 claim. And so that's the state's procedural rule that you're challenging, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So, if you win, then you can bring a 1983 claim without exhausting, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  But you couldn't bring a PLRA claim without exhausting, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. Okay. So that's what I was trying to get at.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  I mean, I think -- I think -- I think the state's position is that, you know, the -- the -- the -- the rule that's being applied here is that you can't bring a claim against the Secretary of Corrections. And I think that's the rule that's not available in federal court.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So let me ask you a question about that. So, you know, the PLRA is a limitation on 1983, and it's a federal statute. But the state's rule, the state's procedural rule, is a state rule, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So why is it that the state procedural rule is not available in federal court?  I mean, it's a state procedural rule that says, if you fail to exhaust, you can't bring a 1983 claim. And, you know, federal courts apply state law, procedural rules, all the time. So why isn't that available in federal court?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Well, I think that it's not available in federal court because this Court has held that the PLRA preempts the state's procedural rule. So I think that the state's procedural rule is preempted by the PLRA, and that's why it's not available in federal court.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So, in that case, I guess I'm not understanding why you're fighting so hard to say that it's a defense. Why -- why couldn't we just say that the state's procedural rule is preempted by the PLRA and that the state can't apply it in federal court?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  I mean, I think -- I think that that's right. I think that's -- I think that's the way to put it. I think that the state is trying to assert this defense in federal court, and I think that the defense is preempted by the PLRA. So I think that's right. And I think that the state is trying to say that this is jurisdictional because, if it's jurisdictional, then the state court gets to decide what the PLRA means and whether it preempts the state's rule. And I think that the state is trying to get around this Court's precedents saying that the PLRA preempts the state's rule by saying that it's jurisdictional.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  But, if we just say it's preempted, then, you know, the state's rule is just preempted, period, and it wouldn't matter whether the state court is applying it or the federal court is applying it, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  I mean, I think that's right. I mean, I think that the -- the state is trying to assert this defense in federal court, and I think that the defense is preempted by the PLRA, and that's why it's not available in federal court. And I think that the state is trying to get around that by saying that it's jurisdictional. But I think that's wrong.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So I have a question about the Chief Justice's question about the FTCA. So the FTCA says that the government is not liable for any claim based on the exercise or performance of a discretionary function or duty. So that's the discretionary-function exception. And it also has an exception for any claim based on the failure of an employee to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty. So, if the state's procedural rule required the prisoner to exhaust before bringing a claim against the state, then presumably that claim would be barred by the discretionary-function exception, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  I think that's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q","cleaned":"        A list of questions that Justice Sonia Sotomayor is likely to ask:\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, there's a lot of confusion in this case about what the state's argument is. You seem to be arguing that it's a procedural rule, and that's the way I read it. But the SG says that it's an affirmative defense. Do you think the state has to say that it's an affirmative defense, or can it do what it's doing and say it's a procedural rule and not have to prove it?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  So I think the state is sort of trying to have it both ways. I think it's very clear that the state is trying to say that it's a procedural rule, and that's the basis of the statute, because it says that it's a condition precedent to the suit. And I think the state is trying to say that it's a procedural rule because it wants to say that it's not a defense that's available in federal court, and I think that's the only way that the state can make that argument. I think the state's other argument is that it's a jurisdictional rule, which is different from a procedural rule, and I think that's the argument that the state is making when it says that the court has no power to hear the case. I think the state is trying to have it both ways, but I think it's pretty clear that it's trying to say it's a procedural rule, and I think that's the only way that it can make the argument that it's not available in federal court.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if it's a procedural rule, it has to be proven by the state?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Well, I think, if it's a procedural rule, it has to be proven by the state in the sense that the state has to come forward with it, but I don't think the state has to prove it in the sense that it has to provide evidence. I think, if it's a procedural rule, the state can just raise it as a procedural rule, and then it would be up to the -- the Petitioners to respond to it. But I think it's pretty clear that the state is trying to say that it's a procedural rule.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Can I go to a second point?  The Chief Justice asked about the difference between the FTCA and 1983. I'm not sure how I see the difference. The FTCA says that the government is liable for torts committed by its employees, except for certain exceptions, and one of those exceptions is the failure to comply with any statute or regulation. So, if the state law requires exhaustion, the government is not liable. So I don't see how the government's position is any different than the state's position.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Well, I think the government's position is that the statute and regulation exception applies to the substantive cause of action. So, for example, if there's a statute or regulation that says that you have to exhaust in order to bring a negligence claim against the United States, then that statute would be applicable. But, if there's a statute that says that you have to exhaust in order to bring a claim against the Secretary of Corrections, I think the government's position is that that would not be applicable. So I think the government is trying to say that the statute and regulation exception is only applicable to the cause of action, and I think that's the difference between the government's position and the state's position.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why would you be liable if you didn't comply with the statute or regulation?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Well, I think that the government would not be liable if you didn't comply with the statute or regulation, but I think that the government is trying to say that the statute or regulation has to be a statute or regulation that applies to the cause of action.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I don't understand.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  So, for example, the statute or regulation that applies to the cause of action is the FTCA itself. So, if you have a negligence claim, the statute or regulation that applies to that is the FTCA. But, if you have a statute or regulation that applies to a claim against the Secretary of Corrections, that would not be a statute or regulation that applies to the cause of action.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So the government is saying that you can't have a procedural requirement that's not in the FTCA?  Is that what you're saying?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Yes, I think that's what the government is saying. And I think that's the difference between the government's position and the state's position.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why is this procedural requirement, this exhaustion requirement, not a procedural requirement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Because it's a procedural requirement that's applicable to a different cause of action. I think it's a procedural requirement applicable to a claim against the Secretary of Corrections, but it's not a procedural requirement applicable to the FTCA.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. I have one last question. The state court said, if you had a claim against the state, you would have been required to exhaust. You would have had to file a 1983 claim against the state, and you would have had to exhaust. So why isn't that the same thing as what they're saying here, that you have to exhaust before you can sue the Secretary?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Well, I think that the state court's position is that, if you bring a claim against the state, then you have to exhaust. But I think that that's a totally different claim. I think that the state court is trying to say that the claim against the state is a different claim from the claim against the Secretary of Corrections. And I think that's the whole point of the PLRA. I think that the PLRA is trying to say that you can bring a claim against the Secretary of Corrections, and you don't have to bring a claim against the state.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Thank you, counsel.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan?  Justice Gorsuch?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Can I ask you about the Chief Justice's question?  Do you agree with the SG that the state could say you have to prove exhaustion, and that would be fine?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  So I think that would be a -- a different question. I think that would be a question of whether the state could change the elements of the claim. I think that that would be a different question than whether the state could assert an affirmative defense, which is what it's doing here. So I think that would be a different question.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. And then, second question, to follow up on Justice Alito's question, if we agree with you that this is not jurisdictional, as I think we have to because of how it's structured, then what are the practical consequences of that in your view?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  I think the practical consequences are that the state would have to raise this affirmative defense in federal court, and it would have to prove it by a preponderance of the evidence. And I think, you know, in this case, the state, you know, had notice and an opportunity to be heard in the federal court, and the federal court held that the state hadn't met its burden. So I think that that's the practical consequence of -- of it not being jurisdictional. And I think that's a pretty big deal because I think that the state, you know, is -- is trying to get a free pass into federal court by saying that this is jurisdictional.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then, to follow up on Justice Alito's question, if we agree with you that it's not jurisdictional, it's a defense, and if we agree with you that it's not a defense that's available in federal court, then why isn't the case over and we can just remand for a trial on the merits?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  So I think that's right. I think that the -- the Eleventh Circuit's decision was based on the assumption that this was jurisdictional, and the Eleventh Circuit said that, you know, because it's jurisdictional, we have to remand to the state court. But, if this Court says that it's not jurisdictional, then I think the Eleventh Circuit's rationale disappears, and I think that the case should be remanded for trial on the merits.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Barrett?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  So, Mr. Unikowsky, I want to make sure that I understand the relationship between 1983 and the PLRA. So let's imagine that the state has a procedural rule that requires you to exhaust before you bring a 1983 claim. So, you know, you have to go to the prison's internal grievance procedure and then, you know, you can bring your 1983 claim. Okay?  So that's the state's procedural rule. And then let's imagine that the state also has a procedural rule that says you have to exhaust before you bring a claim under the PLRA. Okay?  So you have to exhaust before you bring a 1983 claim and before you bring a PLRA claim. So, if you fail to exhaust, you can't bring either claim, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Well, I think that's right. I think that the state's position is that you have to exhaust in order to bring a claim against the Secretary of Corrections. And I think that that's the -- that's the rule that's being applied in this case. And I think that that's the rule that's not available in federal court.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  But the PLRA is the one that's not available in federal court, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Well, I think that the -- the defense that the state is asserting is that you can't bring a claim against the Secretary of Corrections. And I think that that's the defense that's not available in federal court. And I think that the -- the defense that's not available in federal court is the defense that the state is trying to assert here.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. But let me just --<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  I mean, I think the -- the -- the -- the -- the defense that the state is asserting here is that you have to exhaust in order to bring a claim against the Secretary of Corrections. And I think that's the defense that's not available in federal court.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. Let me just make sure that I understand this. So the PLRA is not a cause of action. It's just a limitation on 1983, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So it's a limitation on 1983, and it says that you can't bring a 1983 claim unless you have exhausted. So it's a prerequisite to bringing the 1983 claim, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. And so the state has a procedural rule that says, if you fail to exhaust, you can't bring a 1983 claim. And so that's the state's procedural rule that you're challenging, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So, if you win, then you can bring a 1983 claim without exhausting, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  But you couldn't bring a PLRA claim without exhausting, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. Okay. So that's what I was trying to get at.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  I mean, I think -- I think -- I think the state's position is that, you know, the -- the -- the -- the rule that's being applied here is that you can't bring a claim against the Secretary of Corrections. And I think that's the rule that's not available in federal court.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So let me ask you a question about that. So, you know, the PLRA is a limitation on 1983, and it's a federal statute. But the state's rule, the state's procedural rule, is a state rule, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So why is it that the state procedural rule is not available in federal court?  I mean, it's a state procedural rule that says, if you fail to exhaust, you can't bring a 1983 claim. And, you know, federal courts apply state law, procedural rules, all the time. So why isn't that available in federal court?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G. Unikowsky:  Well, I think that it's not available in federal court because this Court has held that the PLRA preempts the state's procedural rule.

So, in that case, I guess I'm not understanding why you're fighting so hard to say that it's a defense. Why -- why couldn't we just say that the state's procedural rule is preempted by the PLRA and that the state can't apply it in federal court?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G.

I think that the state is trying to assert this defense in federal court, and I think that the defense is preempted by the PLRA. So I think that's right. And I think that the state is trying to say that this is jurisdictional because, if it's jurisdictional, then the state court gets to decide what the PLRA means and whether it preempts the state's rule. And I think that the state is trying to get around this Court's precedents saying that the PLRA preempts the state's rule by saying that it's jurisdictional.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  But, if we just say it's preempted, then, you know, the state's rule is just preempted, period, and it wouldn't matter whether the state court is applying it or the federal court is applying it, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Adam G.

So, you know, you have to go to the prison's internal grievance procedure and then, you know, you can bring your 1983 claim. Okay?  So that's the state's procedural rule. And then let's imagine that the state also has a procedural rule that says you have to exhaust before you bring a claim under the PLRA. Okay?

Unikowsky:  So, for example, the statute or regulation that applies to the cause of action is the FTCA itself. So, if you have a negligence claim, the statute or regulation that applies to that is the FTCA. But, if you have a statute or regulation that applies to a claim against the Secretary of Corrections, that would not be a statute or regulation that applies to the cause of action.<\/text>\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So I have a question about the Chief Justice's question about the FTCA. So the FTCA says that the government is not liable for any claim based on the exercise or performance of a discretionary function or duty. So that's the discretionary-function exception. And it also has an exception for any claim based on the failure of an employee to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty. So, if the state's procedural rule required the prisoner to exhaust before bringing a claim against the state, then presumably that claim would be barred by the discretionary-function exception, right?<\/text>\", \"Adam G. Unikowsky:  Well, I think that the -- the defense that the state is asserting is that you can't bring a claim against the Secretary of Corrections. And I think that that's the defense that's not available in federal court. And I think that the -- the defense that's not available in federal court is the defense that the state is trying to assert here.<\/text>\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. Let me just make sure that I understand this. So the PLRA is not a cause of action. It's just a limitation on 1983, right?<\/text>\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  So, Mr. Unikowsky, I want to make sure that I understand the relationship between 1983 and the PLRA. So let's imagine that the state has a procedural rule that requires you to exhaust before you bring a 1983 claim. So, you know, you have to go to the prison's internal grievance procedure and then, you know, you can bring your 1983 claim. Okay?  So that's the state's procedural rule. And then let's imagine that the state also has a procedural rule that says you have to exhaust before you bring a claim under the PLRA. Okay?  So you have to exhaust before you bring a 1983 claim and before you bring a PLRA claim. So, if you fail to exhaust, you can't bring either claim, right?<\/text>\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  But you couldn't bring a PLRA claim without exhausting, right?<\/text>\", \"Adam G. Unikowsky:  I mean, I think -- I think that that's right. I think that's -- I think that's the way to put it. I think that the state is trying to assert this defense in federal court, and I think that the defense is preempted by the PLRA. So I think that's right. And I think that the state is trying to say that this is jurisdictional because, if it's jurisdictional, then the state court gets to decide what the PLRA means and whether it preempts the state's rule. And I think that the state is trying to get around this Court's precedents saying that the PLRA preempts the state's rule by saying that it's jurisdictional.<\/text>\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  But, if we just say it's preempted, then, you know, the state's rule is just preempted, period, and it wouldn't matter whether the state court is applying it or the federal court is applying it, right?<\/text>\", \"Adam G. Unikowsky:  Yes, I think that's what the government is saying. And I think that's the difference between the government's position and the state's position.<\/text>\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So it's a limitation on 1983, and it says that you can't bring a 1983 claim unless you have exhausted. So it's a prerequisite to bringing the 1983 claim, right?<\/text>\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. Okay. So that's what I was trying to get at.<\/text>\", \"Adam G. Unikowsky:  Well, I think that the state court's position is that, if you bring a claim against the state, then you have to exhaust. But I think that that's a totally different claim. I think that the state court is trying to say that the claim against the state is a different claim from the claim against the Secretary of Corrections. And I think that's the whole point of the PLRA. I think that the PLRA is trying to say that you can bring a claim against the Secretary of Corrections, and you don't have to bring a claim against the state.<\/text>\", \"Adam G. Unikowsky:  Well, I think that the government would not be liable if you didn't comply with the statute or regulation, but I think that the government is trying to say that the statute or regulation has to be a statute or regulation that applies to the cause of action.<\/text>\", \"Adam G. Unikowsky:  Well, I think that's right. I think that the state's position is that you have to exhaust in order to bring a claim against the Secretary of Corrections. And I think that that's the -- that's the rule that's being applied in this case. And I think that that's the rule that's not available in federal court.<\/text>\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. And so the state has a procedural rule that says, if you fail to exhaust, you can't bring a 1983 claim. And so that's the state's procedural rule that you're challenging, right?<\/text>\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. But let me just --<\/text>\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  But the PLRA is the one that's not available in federal court, right?<\/text>\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So why is it that the state procedural rule is not available in federal court?  I mean, it's a state procedural rule that says, if you fail to exhaust, you can't bring a 1983 claim. And, you know, federal courts apply state law, procedural rules, all the time. So why isn't that available in federal court?<\/text>\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, there's a lot of confusion in this case about what the state's argument is. You seem to be arguing that it's a procedural rule, and that's the way I read it. But the SG says that it's an affirmative defense. Do you think the state has to say that it's an affirmative defense, or can it do what it's doing and say it's a procedural rule and not have to prove it?<\/text>\", \"Adam G. Unikowsky:  Because it's a procedural requirement that's applicable to a different cause of action. I think it's a procedural requirement applicable to a claim against the Secretary of Corrections, but it's not a procedural requirement applicable to the FTCA.<\/text>\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So, if you win, then you can bring a 1983 claim without exhausting, right?<\/text>\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why is this procedural requirement, this exhaustion requirement, not a procedural requirement?<\/text>\"]"}

Petitioners' reliance on Patsy ignores the key difference between exhaustion rules created by Congress and exhaustion doctrines crafted by courts. The former may preempt, but the latter do not. They are judge-made timing rules, like ripeness and abstention, that do not add elements to a federal right but merely determine when a federal court is going to hear it. This Court's ripeness and abstention holdings do not apply to state courts. Nor does  its determination that federal courts generally should not send 1983 plaintiffs to the states. Precedent confirms that 1983 does not contain a categorical no -exhaustion element. In Johnson v. Fankell, the Court did not require immediate appellate review of a 1983 defense. In Ohio Civil Rights Commission v. Dayton Christian Schools from 1986, this Court applied Younger abstention to force a 1983 plaintiff back into state agency proceedings. These decisions show that deferring consideration of a federal right does not necessarily alter or defeat it. Thus, while some notice of claims rules, like the one in Felder, are preempted as obstacles to adjudication and liability, agency review is typically a means of adjudication and does not inherently conflict with 1983's remedial purpose. But, even if immediate judicial consideration were an unwritten element of 1983,  neutral jurisdictional rules like Alabama's are still a valid excuse for declining jurisdiction.

One is, I don't know where you get the idea that this is a jurisdictional rule. It's not in the statute. It's not in the rules of the court. It's not in the constitution. It's not in any federal law. It's a common law rule. And I don't know why we would give common law rules the same preemptive power that we give to statutes or constitutional provisions. I think of preemption as being something that is based on a superior law, not based on a common law rule. So where do you get that?<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  Well, Your Honor, I would point the Court to the discussion in Justice Scalia's opinion in Finley v. United States, where he discussed the fact that sovereign immunity is a common law doctrine that is older than the Constitution and that it is a jurisdictional rule. And so, in that sense, it's a common law rule that is jurisdictional. And I think that the same analysis would apply here, where we're talking about a common law rule that has been adopted by the state's highest court to say that this is the rule that we apply to determine whether we have subject matter jurisdiction over a case.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, the problem is that it's not a common law rule. It's a state court rule. It's a state court saying we're going to create a common law rule. But, if it's not in the constitution, if it's not in a statute, if it's not in the rules of the court, how is it jurisdictional?  How do we give it that power?<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  Well, Your Honor, I think, under this Court's decisions in Kontrick and Eberhart, a court's determination that something is jurisdictional is entitled to some degree of respect. And so, in that sense, when the Alabama Supreme Court says that this is a jurisdictional rule, I think that this Court should give that some respect.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm not sure why, meaning we give respect to statutes, to constitutional provisions, to rules of the court. But a common law rule, why do we give it that kind of respect?<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  Well, Your Honor, I think, in that sense, it is a little bit different than a common law rule. It is a rule of Alabama law that is applied by the state's highest court to determine whether it has subject matter jurisdiction over the case.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, counsel, I -- I -- I have a second problem, which is I'm not sure I understand your argument. You started by saying that this is not an element of the cause of action but a jurisdictional rule. All right?  If it's not an element of the cause of action, then how can it preempt a federal cause of action?  I thought our -- that our cases have been very clear that a state -- a state court can't add an element to a federal cause of action. And if it's doing that, then it is preempted. So where do I mis -- where am I wrong in that?<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  Well, Your Honor, I think that you are right in the sense that a state court can't add an element to a federal cause of action. That's the holding of this Court's decisions in City of Boerne and in --<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Right.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  -- Felder.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So that's my point.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  But --<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I don't see how you can square that circle.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  Well, Your Honor, I think that the -- the -- the difference is that exhaustion is a timing rule. It's a rule that says that you can bring your claim, you just have to bring it at a certain time. And so, in that sense, it's not adding an element to the cause of action. It's not changing the elements of the cause of action. It's not saying that you have to prove something additional. It's just saying that you have to bring your claim at a certain time.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you're saying you have to bring it at a certain time and in a certain place, which is the agency, correct?<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And you're saying, if you don't do it there, you can't do it in the court, correct?<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So you're really saying you can't bring it at all, correct?<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  Well, Your Honor, I think that --<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  You're saying you can't bring it at all.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  -- that's not correct, Your Honor. You can bring it. It's just that the -- the state court is saying that you have to bring it at a certain time.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  You can't bring it in a court.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  Well, Your Honor, I think that the -- the -- the state court is saying that you can bring it in court, but you have to bring it at a certain time.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  No, you can't.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  And so --<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I don't know why we're talking in circles.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  Well, Your Honor, I think that the -- the -- the state court is saying that you can bring it in court, but you have to bring it at a certain time. And so, in that sense, it's not changing the elements of the cause of action. It's not saying that you have to prove something additional. It's just saying that you have to bring your claim at a certain time.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Thank you, counsel.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan?  Justice Gorsuch?<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Just to follow up on Justice Sotomayor's question, I think you're saying exhaustion is not an element of the cause of action. Is that correct?<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. And I think you're also saying that the state court correctly determined that the state agency does not have the power to grant the relief that's being sought here?<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And that's a question of state law, right?<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then I think you're also saying, to pick up on Justice Sotomayor's questions, that the state court is saying you can bring your Section 1983 claim, you just have to go to the state agency first, is that correct?<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. And then, to pick up on Justice Gorsuch's questions from earlier, you're saying that the state court is not discriminating against uses of Section 1983 in the state court versus other claims, is that correct?<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G.

LaCour, Jr.:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. And then, to pick up on Justice Thomas's question, you're saying that the state court is not requiring a specific outcome from the state agency, correct?<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G.

One is, I don't know where you get the idea that this is a jurisdictional rule. It's not in the statute. It's not in the rules of the court. It's not in the constitution. It's not in any federal law. It's a common law rule. And I don't know why we would give common law rules the same preemptive power that we give to statutes or constitutional provisions. I think of preemption as being something that is based on a superior law, not based on a common law rule. So where do you get that?<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  Well, Your Honor, I would point the Court to the discussion in Justice Scalia's opinion in Finley v. United States, where he discussed the fact that sovereign immunity is a common law doctrine that is older than the Constitution and that it is a jurisdictional rule. And so, in that sense, it's a common law rule that is jurisdictional. And I think that the same analysis would apply here, where we're talking about a common law rule that has been adopted by the state's highest court to say that this is the rule that we apply to determine whether we have subject matter jurisdiction over a case.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, the problem is that it's not a common law rule. It's a state court rule. It's a state court saying we're going to create a common law rule. But, if it's not in the constitution, if it's not in a statute, if it's not in the rules of the court, how is it jurisdictional?  How do we give it that power?<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Edmund G. LaCour, Jr.:  Well, Your Honor, I think, under this Court's decisions in Kontrick and Eberhart, a court's determination that something is jurisdictional is entitled to some degree of respect. And so, in that sense, when the Alabama Supreme Court says that this is a jurisdictional rule, I think that this Court should give that some respect.<\/text> <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm not sure why, meaning we give respect to statutes, to constitutional provisions, to rules of the court.

If it's not an element of the cause of action, then how can it preempt a federal cause of action?  I thought our -- that our cases have been very clear that a state -- a state court can't add an element to a federal cause of action. And if it's doing that, then it is preempted.

It's a rule that says that you can bring your claim, you just have to bring it at a certain time. And so, in that sense, it's not adding an element to the cause of action.

That default rule should resolve this case. Nothing in the text suggests that Congress intended a clear and convincing evidence standard to apply to the 34 exemptions under the Fair Labor Standard  -- Fair Labor Standards Act. Respondent  --Respondents argue that a heightened standard is appropriate because FLSA rights are important. But a preponderance standard applies to rights against race discrimination and disability discrimination and rights to organize and to workplace safety, all super-important rights. This Court has reserved the clear and convincing standard to deprivations by the government of critical rights that don't involve money damages. This Court has never allowed plaintiffs to use a clear and convincing  standard as a sword, and it certainly has never read a clear and convincing standard into a statute for money damages. Respondents also argue that overtime rights aren't waivable. But waivability and standards of proof are unrelated and don't go hand in hand. Waivability goes to who owns the right, the government or the individual, and the standard of proof goes to how hard it is to prove that the right attaches in the first place. Thus, the preponderance of the evidence standard governs non-waivable rights, such as those under the NLRA and OSHA, and heightened standards govern waivable rights, such as those in criminal trials and deportation hearings. Because the court below applied only the clear and convincing standard, we think this Court should remand for the application of the preponderance standard.

These questions should reflect the justice\u2019s known priorities, jurisprudence, and typical questioning style, and they should be directly relevant to the arguments presented in the opening statement.\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Carefully analyze the opening statement to identify key arguments, assumptions, or ambiguities.\n        2. Generate questions that the specified justice might ask. Limit to 15 or less questions. Do not repeat questions.\n        3. Format each question with specific start and end tags for easier parsing:\n           - Use `<START_Q>` at the beginning of each question.\n           - Use `<END_Q>` at the end of each question.\n\n        ### Example:\n        ### Your Task:\n        Justice: {justice_name}\n        Opening Statement: {opening_statement}\n\n        ### Output:\n        A list of questions that {justice_name} is likely to ask:\n        <START_Q> text of question one <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> text of question two <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> text of question three <END_Q><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Your Task:\n        Justice: Justice Sonia Sotomayor\n        Opening Statement: <speaker>Lisa S. Blatt<\/speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  For over a century, this Court has held that the default standard in civil cases is preponderance of the evidence. That default rule should resolve this case. Nothing in the text suggests that Congress intended a clear and convincing evidence standard to apply to the 34 exemptions under the Fair Labor Standard  -- Fair Labor Standards Act. Respondent  --Respondents argue that a heightened standard is appropriate because FLSA rights are important. But a preponderance standard applies to rights against race discrimination and disability discrimination and rights to organize and to workplace safety, all super-important rights. This Court has reserved the clear and convincing standard to deprivations by the government of critical rights that don't involve money damages. This Court has never allowed plaintiffs to use a clear and convincing  standard as a sword, and it certainly has never read a clear and convincing standard into a statute for money damages. Respondents also argue that overtime rights aren't waivable. But waivability and standards of proof are unrelated and don't go hand in hand. Waivability goes to who owns the right, the government or the individual, and the standard of proof goes to how hard it is to prove that the right attaches in the first place. Thus, the preponderance of the evidence standard governs non-waivable rights, such as those under the NLRA and OSHA, and heightened standards govern waivable rights, such as those in criminal trials and deportation hearings. Because the court below applied only the clear and convincing standard, we think this Court should remand for the application of the preponderance standard. I welcome the Court's questions.<\/text>\n\n        ### Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n        Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Ms. Blatt, I'm not quite sure that I understood the logic of your argument.

You -- you say that the preponderance of the evidence is the default rule. And I accept that that's what the common law was. But, here, we have a statute that doesn't mention it. And the question is, how do we know that Congress intended the common law default to apply?  So, if I go back to what I said to your adversary, which is, if we look at the statute and we see that it says an employer shall pay wages, all right, what does that tell us?  Does it tell us that Congress intended the common law to apply?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Let's assume --<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  -- that the common law is the default. There are a lot of exceptions to that default. So let's assume I accept your argument. How do I know that this is the default and not one of the exceptions?  What would I look at to determine that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, the common law  --<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's assume that I disagree with you that the common law is the default because I don't see how you can separate out the common law from the exceptions to the common law. How do I know which one is the default?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you're not answering my question.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's  --<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So how do I know that the common law is the default and not the exceptions?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's assume that I disagree with you that the common law is the default, that I see the common law as a default with exceptions. How do I know which one applies here?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's not what I'm asking. I'm asking, what are the factors that you would look at to determine whether this is a common law default or an exception to the common law default?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I  -- I -- I don't disagree with you, but how do I know that this is a common law default?  That's really what I'm asking you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, what do I look at to determine that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's not what I'm asking. I'm asking, what do I look at to determine that this is a common law default and not an exception to the common law default?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, but you're not answering my question, which is, what do I look at to determine whether this is an exception or a default?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, I'm asking you to give me something other than the common law, because you're assuming that the common law is the default, and I'm not sure it is.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But I don't know why you're not answering my question.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if I look at the statute and I see that it's not a criminal statute, that it's a civil statute, that it's a remedial statute, that it's a remedial statute that's designed to protect the most vulnerable people, the ones who are the least paid, that it's a remedial statute that's designed to protect their wages, what do I do with that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's not my question. My question is, what do I do with that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if I see that the  -- that the -- the burden of proof is not clear, that the statute is silent, that it's not a criminal statute, it's a civil statute, that it's a remedial statute, that it's a remedial statute that's designed to protect the most vulnerable people, that it's a remedial statute that's designed to protect their wages, why should I not say that it's a statute that should be construed against the party who's trying to deprive the worker of the wage?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's the question, which is, what do I do with the fact that it's silent?  I mean, if it's silent, it's not giving me a clue. So I have to look at the statute and see what it's designed to do, and it's designed to protect workers.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what do I do with that?  I mean, I  -- I -- I -- I'm -- I'm trying to figure out how to answer your adversary's point, which is, if it's silent, if it's not clear, why shouldn't we construe it in favor of the vulnerable worker?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's not my question. My question is, how do I know that it's not clear?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's not my question. My question is, if it's not clear, what do I do with that?  I have to do something with it. I have to figure out what the default is. And I think that my colleagues are asking you to assume that the common law is not the default. So how do I know what the default is?  And if I don't know, what do I do with the fact that it's a remedial statute?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what do I do with that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why shouldn't I say that that's an exception to the common law?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So how do I know that it's not an exception?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But why is that an exception?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's a different argument. I'm not talking about that argument. I'm talking about the fact that it's a remedial statute that's designed to protect the most vulnerable people, that it's a remedial statute that's designed to protect their wages. Why isn't that an exception to the common law default?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the fact that it's a remedial statute. Why isn't that an exception to the common law?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let me go back to my original question. If I see that it's a remedial statute, it's designed to protect the most vulnerable workers, it's designed to protect their wages, why shouldn't I say that the exception to the common law default is that it's a remedial statute and, therefore, that the burden of proof should be on the party trying to deprive the worker of their wages?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm not talking about the constitutional question. I'm talking about the statutory question.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if I look at this statute and I see that it's a remedial statute, it's designed to protect the most vulnerable workers, it's designed to protect their wages, why shouldn't I say that the exception to the common law default is that it's a remedial statute and, therefore, that the burden of proof should be on the party trying to deprive the worker of their wages?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if I see that the statute is silent, that it's not a criminal statute, it's a civil statute, that it's a remedial statute, that it's a remedial statute that's designed to protect the most vulnerable people, that it's a remedial statute that's designed to protect their wages, why shouldn't I say that the exception to the common law default is that it's a remedial statute and, therefore, that the burden of proof should be on the party trying to deprive the worker of their wages?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, why shouldn't I?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm asking you why shouldn't I.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why shouldn't I?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why shouldn't I?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, I'm not sure that's true.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, I'm not sure that's true.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, I'm not sure that's true.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let me go to your adversary's point, which is that the  -- that the -- the -- the statute of limitations is very short, that the employer has the burden of keeping the records, and that the employer has the burden of keeping the records for a certain amount of time. So, if the employer doesn't keep the records, it's at risk of losing its defense. So why should we give it the benefit of the doubt?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what the common law says, but that's the whole point, which is, why should we follow the common law default?  And that's what I'm asking you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let me go to your adversary's second point, which is, assume that I agree with you that the common law is the default, but there are exceptions to the common law. And one of the exceptions is when there's a remedial statute. And I think that what my colleagues are saying is, if you assume that this is a remedial statute, why isn't it an exception to the common law default?  So answer that question.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's not my question.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if I assume that it's a remedial statute, why isn't it an exception to the common law?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's  --that's assuming the answer.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's  -- that's assuming the answer.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let me go to another point. Your adversary says that the preponderance of the evidence standard is unfair to employees. Employees don't have the records. They have to rely on their recollection. They have to rely on their own records. They have to rely on their own observations. They have to rely on the observations of others. And it's very difficult for them to prove the elements of their claim. So, if it's unfair to them, why shouldn't we say that the burden of proof should be on the employer, who has the records?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what I'm asking you. Why should we say that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what I'm asking you. Why should we say that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what I'm asking you. Why should we say that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what I'm asking you. Why should we say that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what I'm asking you. Why should we say that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what I'm asking you.

You -- you say that the preponderance of the evidence is the default rule. And I accept that that's what the common law was. But, here, we have a statute that doesn't mention it. And the question is, how do we know that Congress intended the common law default to apply?  So, if I go back to what I said to your adversary, which is, if we look at the statute and we see that it says an employer shall pay wages, all right, what does that tell us?  Does it tell us that Congress intended the common law to apply?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Let's assume --<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  -- that the common law is the default. There are a lot of exceptions to that default. So let's assume I accept your argument. How do I know that this is the default and not one of the exceptions?  What would I look at to determine that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, the common law  --<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's assume that I disagree with you that the common law is the default because I don't see how you can separate out the common law from the exceptions to the common law. How do I know which one is the default?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you're not answering my question.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's  --<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So how do I know that the common law is the default and not the exceptions?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's assume that I disagree with you that the common law is the default, that I see the common law as a default with exceptions. How do I know which one applies here?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's not what I'm asking. I'm asking, what are the factors that you would look at to determine whether this is a common law default or an exception to the common law default?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I  -- I -- I don't disagree with you, but how do I know that this is a common law default?  That's really what I'm asking you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, what do I look at to determine that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's not what I'm asking.

So, if I look at the statute and I see that it's not a criminal statute, that it's a civil statute, that it's a remedial statute, that it's a remedial statute that's designed to protect the most vulnerable people, the ones who are the least paid, that it's a remedial statute that's designed to protect their wages, what do I do with that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's not my question. My question is, what do I do with that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if I see that the  -- that the -- the burden of proof is not clear, that the statute is silent, that it's not a criminal statute, it's a civil statute, that it's a remedial statute, that it's a remedial statute that's designed to protect the most vulnerable people, that it's a remedial statute that's designed to protect their wages, why should I not say that it's a statute that should be construed against the party who's trying to deprive the worker of the wage?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's the question, which is, what do I do with the fact that it's silent?  I mean, if it's silent, it's not giving me a clue. So I have to look at the statute and see what it's designed to do, and it's designed to protect workers.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what do I do with that?  I mean, I  -- I -- I -- I'm -- I'm trying to figure out how to answer your adversary's point, which is, if it's silent, if it's not clear, why shouldn't we construe it in favor of the vulnerable worker?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's not my question. My question is, how do I know that it's not clear?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's not my question. My question is, if it's not clear, what do I do with that?  I have to do something with it. I have to figure out what the default is. And I think that my colleagues are asking you to assume that the common law is not the default. So how do I know what the default is?  And if I don't know, what do I do with the fact that it's a remedial statute?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what do I do with that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why shouldn't I say that that's an exception to the common law?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So how do I know that it's not an exception?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But why is that an exception?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's a different argument. I'm not talking about that argument. I'm talking about the fact that it's a remedial statute that's designed to protect the most vulnerable people, that it's a remedial statute that's designed to protect their wages. Why isn't that an exception to the common law default?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the fact that it's a remedial statute. Why isn't that an exception to the common law?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let me go back to my original question. If I see that it's a remedial statute, it's designed to protect the most vulnerable workers, it's designed to protect their wages, why shouldn't I say that the exception to the common law default is that it's a remedial statute and, therefore, that the burden of proof should be on the party trying to deprive the worker of their wages?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm not talking about the constitutional question. I'm talking about the statutory question.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if I look at this statute and I see that it's a remedial statute, it's designed to protect the most vulnerable workers, it's designed to protect their wages, why shouldn't I say that the exception to the common law default is that it's a remedial statute and, therefore, that the burden of proof should be on the party trying to deprive the worker of their wages?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if I see that the statute is silent, that it's not a criminal statute, it's a civil statute, that it's a remedial statute, that it's a remedial statute that's designed to protect the most vulnerable people, that it's a remedial statute that's designed to protect their wages, why shouldn't I say that the exception to the common law default is that it's a remedial statute and, therefore, that the burden of proof should be on the party trying to deprive the worker of their wages?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, why shouldn't I?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm asking you why shouldn't I.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why shouldn't I?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why shouldn't I?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, I'm not sure that's true.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, I'm not sure that's true.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, I'm not sure that's true.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let me go to your adversary's point, which is that the  -- that the -- the -- the statute of limitations is very short, that the employer has the burden of keeping the records, and that the employer has the burden of keeping the records for a certain amount of time. So, if the employer doesn't keep the records, it's at risk of losing its defense. So why should we give it the benefit of the doubt?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what the common law says, but that's the whole point, which is, why should we follow the common law default?  And that's what I'm asking you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let me go to your adversary's second point, which is, assume that I agree with you that the common law is the default, but there are exceptions to the common law. And one of the exceptions is when there's a remedial statute. And I think that what my colleagues are saying is, if you assume that this is a remedial statute, why isn't it an exception to the common law default?  So answer that question.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's not my question.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if I assume that it's a remedial statute, why isn't it an exception to the common law?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's  --that's assuming the answer.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's  -- that's assuming the answer.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let me go to another point. Your adversary says that the preponderance of the evidence standard is unfair to employees. Employees don't have the records. They have to rely on their recollection. They have to rely on their own records. They have to rely on their own observations. They have to rely on the observations of others. And it's very difficult for them to prove the elements of their claim. So, if it's unfair to them, why shouldn't we say that the burden of proof should be on the employer, who has the records?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what I'm asking you. Why should we say that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what I'm asking you. Why should we say that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what I'm asking you. Why should we say that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what I'm asking you.

Ho<\/speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The False Claims Act, which casts its shadow over every aspect of the administrative state, has always been trained on guarding the public fisc. The FCA protects government funds by defining a claim as a request for money the government provides or that's presented to a government agent. As a result of political branch choices, E-rate reimbursement requests check neither box. The program could have been funded with public money and administered by a government agency, but the political branches chose private funding and a private administrator to prevent E-rate money from being used to mask budget shortfalls and to avoid the Government Corporation Control Act. The consequence of those choices is that E-rate reimbursement requests aren't FCA claims. First, the government doesn't provide any money in the E-rate program. Text, context, structure, and history all confirm that the government provides money for FCA purposes only if it supplies money from its own funds, putting  the public fisc at risk. That never happened here. The government doesn't provide money by making one private party pay another private party, and the government doesn't provide money by collecting debts owed to a private party and in which the government has no financial stake. Second, the program's private administrator, the Administrative Company, isn't a government agent. By design, it lacks power to bind the government, which in turn lacks control over what matters here:  grants of E-rate reimbursement requests. In fact, we know the company can't be a government agent because, if it were, it would violate the Government Corporation Control Act. Choices have consequences, and the choices made by the political branches to insulate the E-rate program from the public fisc foreclose applying the FCA.

The program could have been funded with public money and administered by a government agency, but the political branches chose private funding and a private administrator to prevent E-rate money from being used to mask budget shortfalls and to avoid the Government Corporation Control Act. The consequence of those choices is that E-rate reimbursement requests aren't FCA claims. First, the government doesn't provide any money in the E-rate program. Text, context, structure, and history all confirm that the government provides money for FCA purposes only if it supplies money from its own funds, putting  the public fisc at risk. That never happened here. The government doesn't provide money by making one private party pay another private party, and the government doesn't provide money by collecting debts owed to a private party and in which the government has no financial stake. Second, the program's private administrator, the Administrative Company, isn't a government agent. By design, it lacks power to bind the government, which in turn lacks control over what matters here:  grants of E-rate reimbursement requests. In fact, we know the company can't be a government agent because, if it were, it would violate the Government Corporation Control Act. Choices have consequences, and the choices made by the political branches to insulate the E-rate program from the public fisc foreclose applying the FCA.

Ho<\/speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The False Claims Act, which casts its shadow over every aspect of the administrative state, has always been trained on guarding the public fisc. The FCA protects government funds by defining a claim as a request for money the government provides or that's presented to a government agent. As a result of political branch choices, E-rate reimbursement requests check neither box. The program could have been funded with public money and administered by a government agency, but the political branches chose private funding and a private administrator to prevent E-rate money from being used to mask budget shortfalls and to avoid the Government Corporation Control Act. The consequence of those choices is that E-rate reimbursement requests aren't FCA claims. First, the government doesn't provide any money in the E-rate program. Text, context, structure, and history all confirm that the government provides money for FCA purposes only if it supplies money from its own funds, putting  the public fisc at risk. That never happened here. The government doesn't provide money by making one private party pay another private party, and the government doesn't provide money by collecting debts owed to a private party and in which the government has no financial stake. Second, the program's private administrator, the Administrative Company, isn't a government agent. By design, it lacks power to bind the government, which in turn lacks control over what matters here:  grants of E-rate reimbursement requests. In fact, we know the company can't be a government agent because, if it were, it would violate the Government Corporation Control Act. Choices have consequences, and the choices made by the political branches to insulate the E-rate program from the public fisc foreclose applying the FCA. I welcome the Court's questions.<\/text>\n\n        ### Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n        A list of questions that Justice Sonia Sotomayor is likely to ask:\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, you seem to be saying that because this is a private program, the FCA doesn't apply. But the FCA doesn't just cover government programs. It covers private programs. It covers government contractors, it covers Medicare, it covers Medicaid, it covers any other private entity that is seeking government funds. And so I think what you're saying is, if the government chooses to do this through a private entity, it's not covered by the False Claims Act. Is that what you're saying?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  No, Your Honor. What we're saying is that, here, the government has not provided money. And that's the -- that's the linchpin of the FCA. And that's what the Court said in Allison, that the FCA is focused on money that the government provides. And that is not the case here. And I think it's important to -- to draw a distinction between -- between -- between the government's money and the government's money in the sense of the government's providing money to a contractor or to a grant recipient. And -- and, certainly, in the case of Medicare, it's the government's money. It's the government's funds that are being used to reimburse Medicare providers. But, here, the government has not provided money to the program. And that's -- that's the critical distinction.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, you're saying the government doesn't provide money to Medicare providers. The government provides money to the insurance companies who pay the Medicare providers, correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Yes, Your Honor, that's correct. But it's the government's money that's being used to reimburse Medicare providers.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, but it's not the government's money that's being used to reimburse the E-rate providers. It's the government's money that's being used to reimburse the telephone companies who reimburse the E-rate providers, correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  That's -- that's right, Your Honor. And -- and the government's money is not being used to reimburse E-rate providers. And I think that's the critical distinction. And I think that's what the Court said in Allison, is that the -- the government's money is being used to reimburse Medicare providers. And that's not the case here.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So you're saying that the government's money has to go directly to the person who's committing the fraud?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  No, Your Honor. I -- I think -- I think what we're saying is that the government's money has to be used to reimburse. And I think that's what the Court said in Allison, is that the government's money is being used to reimburse Medicare providers. And that's not the case here. The government's money is not being used to reimburse E-rate providers.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I -- I -- I don't understand. The government's money is being used to reimburse the telephone companies who are paying the E-rate providers.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Yes, Your Honor, that's -- that's correct. And -- and that's why we think that the government's money is not being used to reimburse E-rate providers.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's circular. You're saying because it's not going directly, it's not being used. But it is being used indirectly, isn't it?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Your Honor, I think that the government's money is not being used to reimburse E-rate providers. And -- and I think that's the critical distinction here. And -- and I think that's what the Court said in Allison. And I think, if the Court looks at the statutory text, the statutory context, the statutory structure, and the history of the statute, I think that all of those things confirm that the -- that the government's money has to be used to reimburse in order for it to be a claim under the False Claims Act.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Thank you, counsel.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Ms. Ho, if I could take you back to the conversation that you had with Justice Thomas. I mean, suppose that the government had decided to administer this program itself, and it had set up a government agency and it had put the government agency in charge of collecting the fees and distributing the funds, but everything else was the same. In other words, the government said, we're going to do this ourselves, we're going to set up a government agency, it's going to collect the fees, it's going to distribute the funds, but the program is going to be the same. Would there be False Claims Act liability in that world?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Yes, Your Honor. We think that there would be.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  And what's the difference between that world and this world?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  I think the difference between that world and this world is that in that world, the government is providing the money, and in this world, the government is not providing the money. And I think that's the critical distinction. And I think that's what the Court said in Allison, is that the government's money has to be used to reimburse. And that's what makes it a claim under the False Claims Act.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I -- I guess I don't understand that, Ms. Ho, because, in both worlds, it's the same money. It's the same money in the sense of it's the same program, it's the same money that's being collected, it's the same money that's being distributed. The only difference is that the government is doing it itself as opposed to having a private entity do it.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Yes, Your Honor. And I think that's a critical difference because, in that world, it is the government's money. It's the government's funds that are being used to reimburse the E-rate providers. And that's what makes it a claim under the False Claims Act. But, here, the government has not provided the money. The government's money is not being used to reimburse E-rate providers. And that's the critical distinction.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Thank you, Ms. Ho.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Good morning, Ms. Ho. I -- I'd like to take you back to where Justice Thomas was going with his line of questioning. I think you said that the government could bring a False Claims Act action against your client. Is that right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And -- and -- and how would that work?  I mean, there'd be no damages, right?  There's no government injury.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  I -- I think there would be damages, Your Honor. I mean, I think that the -- the -- the damages that the government could seek are the damages that are provided for in the statute, which are the amount of the false claim and a civil penalty.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Well, but the amount of the false claim is the amount of the claim to the administrator, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  And the administrator's not injured, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  The administrator is not injured. And I think that's --<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  So the administrator would be -- would be bringing an action on behalf of the government, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  I -- I think that's right, Your Honor. I think that's how the statute works.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And -- and -- and the government, in turn, would have to pay the administrator its fees, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Well, I -- I think --<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I mean, the -- the -- the administrator's not a volunteer here. It's getting fees from the government, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. So the government would have to pay the administrator for its services in bringing an action on behalf of the government to seek money that the administrator's not injured by?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Well, I -- I think, Your Honor, that's -- I think that's right. I mean, I think that's how the statute works. And I think that's what the Court said in Allison, is that the -- the -- the government can bring a claim on behalf of -- of itself, and it's the government's money that's being used to reimburse Medicare providers. And -- and I think that's the distinction that the Court made in Allison.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  So the government could bring an action against a private party to recover funds for a private administrator who's not injured?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Yes, Your Honor, I think that's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kavanaugh.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Ms. Ho. I want to pick up on Justice Gorsuch's questions and ask you to assume that Congress could have brought a cause of action like this against you, as you indicated, and also could have delegated to the administrator the authority to bring such a cause of action. If that's correct, why should we care that they chose to do it through the False Claims Act rather than through a separate statutory provision that would have been more explicit about what's going on here?  In other words, if the administrator could have been delegated the authority to bring this kind of cause of action, why should it matter that they chose to do it in this somewhat more roundabout way through the False Claims Act?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I think that the -- the reason that it matters is because the statute, as this Court said in Allison, is focused on the government's money. And -- and I think that's the critical distinction. And I think, if -- if the Court looks at the statutory text, the statutory context, the statutory structure, and the history of the statute, I think that all of those things confirm that the government's money has to be used to reimburse in order for it to be a claim under the False Claims Act.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  But the government could have brought this cause of action against you, correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And the government could have delegated to the administrator the authority to bring this cause of action, correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And, therefore, the administrator could bring the cause of action, correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And, therefore, a relator could bring the cause of action, correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Barrett.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Good morning, Ms. Ho. I want to ask you about the government's argument that the False Claims Act should be read in harmony with the common law of fraud. And you point out that the common law of fraud doesn't have a similarly defined \"claim\" concept. But I guess I'm wondering, if the False Claims Act is meant to be read in harmony with the common law of fraud, why should we care about the word \"claim\" at all?  I mean, you know, the -- the -- the government says that the common law of fraud required a tangible harm, so why shouldn't we just be focused on whether there's been tangible harm?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Your Honor, I think that the -- the Court has said that the False Claims Act is meant to be read in harmony with the common law of fraud, but I think that that has to be with the text of the statute, and the text of the statute requires a claim. And I think that's critical. And I think that's what the Court said in Allison, is that the statute requires a claim, and the claim has to be a claim for money, and the money has to be the government's money.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  So, in other words, you're saying that the common law of fraud informs the definition of \"claim\"?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  I think it -- I think it does, Your Honor. And -- and I think that's what the Court said in Allison. I think that's what the Court said in Cochran. And I think that's what the Court said in Lujan, that the common law of fraud informs the definition of \"claim.\"  And I think that's --<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And then, when you talk about the government's money, I mean, you're talking about the government's money in the sense of the money that it's administering, not the money that it's spending, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Yes, Your Honor. And -- and I think that's the distinction that the Court made in Allison. And I think that's what the -- the common law of fraud informs the definition of \"claim\" in the statute.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And just to clarify, because I'm not sure I understood your answer to Justice Kavanaugh, you're saying that the government could have brought a fraud action against you, right, even though it's not the government's money in the sense of the money that it's spending?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Yes, Your Honor. I think that's right. I think that's what the Court said in Allison, is that the government could have brought a fraud action. And I think that's what the government's position is in this case, is that the government could have brought a fraud action. And I think that's the critical distinction.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Jackson.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  Yes. So I guess I'm trying to understand the limits of your argument. I mean, you say that the government could have brought a fraud action against you, but presumably, if they had, it would have been under the False Claims Act, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  So is your argument that the False Claims Act is limited in this way, or is it that the government just has to prove that it's a claim for money or entitled to payment under the particular statute?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  I think -- I think it's the latter, Your Honor, that the -- that the government has to prove that it's a claim for money or payment that's entitled to payment under the particular statute.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  Okay. So, to the extent that you're relying on the common law of fraud, you're just saying that that informs the Court's understanding of what a claim is for purposes of the statute, correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END","cleaned":"        A list of questions that Justice Sonia Sotomayor is likely to ask:\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, you seem to be saying that because this is a private program, the FCA doesn't apply.

I mean, suppose that the government had decided to administer this program itself, and it had set up a government agency and it had put the government agency in charge of collecting the fees and distributing the funds, but everything else was the same. In other words, the government said, we're going to do this ourselves, we're going to set up a government agency, it's going to collect the fees, it's going to distribute the funds, but the program is going to be the same. Would there be False Claims Act liability in that world?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Yes, Your Honor.

It's the same money in the sense of it's the same program, it's the same money that's being collected, it's the same money that's being distributed.

If that's correct, why should we care that they chose to do it through the False Claims Act rather than through a separate statutory provision that would have been more explicit about what's going on here?  In other words, if the administrator could have been delegated the authority to bring this kind of cause of action, why should it matter that they chose to do it in this somewhat more roundabout way through the False Claims Act?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N.

I want to ask you about the government's argument that the False Claims Act should be read in harmony with the common law of fraud. And you point out that the common law of fraud doesn't have a similarly defined \"claim\" concept. But I guess I'm wondering, if the False Claims Act is meant to be read in harmony with the common law of fraud, why should we care about the word \"claim\" at all?  I mean, you know, the -- the -- the government says that the common law of fraud required a tangible harm, so why shouldn't we just be focused on whether there's been tangible harm?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  Your Honor, I think that the -- the Court has said that the False Claims Act is meant to be read in harmony with the common law of fraud, but I think that that has to be with the text of the statute, and the text of the statute requires a claim. And I think that's critical. And I think that's what the Court said in Allison, is that the statute requires a claim, and the claim has to be a claim for money, and the money has to be the government's money.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  So, in other words, you're saying that the common law of fraud informs the definition of \"claim\"?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N. Ho:  I think it -- I think it does, Your Honor. And -- and I think that's what the Court said in Allison. I think that's what the Court said in Cochran.

Ho:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  So is your argument that the False Claims Act is limited in this way, or is it that the government just has to prove that it's a claim for money or entitled to payment under the particular statute?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Allyson N.

The administrator pays on the government's behalf using money the government collects and controls  to advance a federal program that the government created. FCC mandates, which the administrator must follow, specify who must be paid and how much they must be paid. So, when the administrator paid Wisconsin Bell, that was the government providing money through its agent. Indeed, many government programs, including most notably Medicare, use private claims administrators to provide billions of dollars to beneficiaries of government programs. As Justice Kagan's soup hypothetical, Justice Barrett's proctor hypothetical illustrate, when an entity like the government provides money through agents, we credit the principal in that situation. So, when Wisconsin Bell  receives money, claims money, from the E-rate program, we credit the government with providing it. FCC mandates also  determine carriers' obligations to contribute to the Universal Service Fund. Those mandates are how the government provided funds to this program, and  it doesn't matter that the government routed the funds directly from the carriers to the  Universal Service Fund instead of requiring an unnecessary detour through federal Treasury accounts because the False Claims Act's applicability doesn't turn on bookkeeping conventions, which is also a point Ms. Ho made, I think, quite well. The point is not exactly how did the money move through a bureaucracy, was it routed efficiently or less efficiently. The point is who is really making the money move, and it is the government. The government is the only relevant decision-maker at all stages of creating, funding, and then controlling the distributions from this program. The administrator merely does what the government wants. Under the plain meaning of the word \"provide,\" the government therefore provides the money Wisconsin Bell claims.

And if we accept your theory, I don't know how we get out of the result that Justice Barrett was talking about, which is, if the government pays for a Medicare program and the doctors are fraudulently overcharging, that that's not actionable under the False Claims Act.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So, Justice Sotomayor, I think that there are two differences between the Medicare program and the E-rate program that are relevant here. The first is that the E-rate program is funded by a tax on carriers, and it's the government's decision how much carriers must pay. In the Medicare context, it's the government's decision how much to pay to providers, and so that's a second difference. And so, in the Medicare context, I think the government is the party that's being defrauded. In the E-rate context, the party that's being defrauded is the carriers that are paying more than they otherwise would have to because of the fraud.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Can we go to that?  I don't know why that's true. I mean, the government could have set up this program and said to the administrator:  Distribute this money to the schools on our behalf, we'll pay you back later. Instead, it set up the program and said:  We want you to collect the money from the carriers, give it to the schools, and we'll pay you the difference. It's still the government who's deciding who pays and how much.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think that's right as a general matter, but I think, in this particular case, there's a specific reason why that's not true, and that is because the government has said that it does not have a contractual relationship with the schools. And so, if the government --<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, it doesn't have a contractual relationship with Medicare recipients either.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's right. But, in the Medicare context, the government has not said that it's acting as an agent of the providers. In this context, the government has said that it is acting as an agent of the carriers. And so that means that when the administrator pays the schools, it's not acting as a principal. It's acting as an agent of the carriers.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Could you tell me what's the difference between an agent and a subrogation claim?  Meaning, if the government pays for a fraudulent overcharge by a doctor and then sues the doctor to get its money back, it's not an agent of the doctor. It's a subrogee, correct?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's right. And I think that the -- the reason why that's different is because, in that context, the government has paid the money and then is seeking to get it back. And so the government is acting as a principal in that context. Whereas, in the E-rate context, the government has not paid the money. It's the carriers that have paid the money. And so the government is acting as an agent of the carriers, and that's why the claims belong to the carriers.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <turn>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?<\/text>\n        <turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, Mr. Singh, I -- I understand your argument that the government is acting as an agent of the carriers, but I don't understand your argument that the government is providing the money. You said several times that the government is providing the money. I don't know what that means. The government has decided that the money is going to be provided by the carriers, and it's going to oversee the program, but it's not providing the money. Am I wrong about that?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think that the government is providing the money in the sense that it is instructing the administrator to provide the money. So the administrator doesn't have any independent discretion to decide who gets the money and how much they get. The government has complete control over that. And so the government is the one that's providing the money in the sense that it's instructing the administrator to do so.<\/text>\n        <\/turn>\n        <turn>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, let me give you this example. Suppose a parent says to a child, I want you to mow the lawn of our next-door neighbor, and I will give you $10 to do that. Has the parent provided the money to the neighbor?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I -- I think that in ordinary parlance, we would say that the parent has provided the money in that context because the parent is instructing the child to do so and has the ability to control the child's actions. And so, if the child doesn't do it, the parent can instruct the child to do it again. And so I think, in that context, we would say that the parent is providing the money.

Waxman<\/speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Richard Glossip was convicted on the word of one man, Justin Sneed, the undisputed murderer in this case. Oklahoma has now disclosed evidence revealing that Mr. Sneed lied to the jury about his history of psychiatric treatment, including the fact that a prison psychiatrist prescribed lithium to treat his previously undiagnosed bipolar disorder. The prosecution suppressed that evidence and then failed to correct Mr. Sneed's perjured denial, just as it suppressed evidence that in the middle of trial, in violation of the court's sequestration order, Sneed altered his testimony about the knife wounds on the victim at the urgent request of the prosecutor, who then falsely denied to the court her prior knowledge. There is no adequate or independent jurisdictional bar to review and no warrant for an evidentiary hearing. As to independence, the court's opinion is suffused with merits determinations on the Brady and Napue claims. And, certainly, there is no \"clear and express statement\" that the court's decision is based on a bona fide separate, adequate, and independent grounds, as long required by this Court to preclude review. Nor is there any adequate bar. By rejecting the State's waiver, the court created a jurisdictional threshold it had never applied in any other case. The disposition was \"without support in prior state law,\" as required by over 60 years of this Court's precedent to establish adequacy. No evidentiary hearing could alter the conclusion that Mr. Glossip was denied due process. There's no dispute that, contrary to Sneed's sworn testimony, the State's own suppressed record shows that he was, in fact, treated by a psychiatrist for bipolar disorder, just as there is no dispute that Sneed changed his testimony about the knife at the  urgent mid-trial request of the prosecutor, who then falsely denied that very fact to the court. This Court should reverse and remand for a new trial.

I know that the Oklahoma court said that it would have reached the same result without this witness, but I'm not sure how that can be, given that the defense expert was discredited in part by this witness and that the defense expert's testimony was central to the defense. So how can the Oklahoma court say that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Paul D. Clement:  So, Justice Sotomayor, I think, if you look at the opinion, I think it's a little bit of a -- a bit of a mixed bag. I think, in fairness, if you look at the opinion, they do say that they don't think that the testimony would have made a difference. But I think, if you read the opinion, it's clear that they don't think that the testimony would have made a difference because they say that they think that the defense expert's testimony was  -- was -- was not credible. And, of course, we think that that's a conclusion that's not justified. But I think, if you look at the opinion, the way they justify that is by saying that the defense expert's testimony was not credible because of the testimony of the prosecution expert. And so I think it's a little bit of a circular argument. But, at the end of the day, I think the opinion is pretty clear that the court does not think that this testimony would have made a difference. And I think, if you look at the facts, it's hard to see how the court could reach that conclusion, because the defense expert's testimony was the only testimony that was offered to try to prove the affirmative defense that the  -- the -- the -- the crime was not death-eligible because it was a felony murder that was not premeditated. And the only way that the defense expert could have possibly supported that conclusion was by saying that the victim was not killed in the course of the robbery, and the only way he could have supported that was by saying that the victim was not killed in the living room, which is where the robbery took place, but was instead killed in the bedroom. And so I think, if you look at the opinion, I think the court is pretty clear that the testimony of the defense expert was not credible because he said that the victim was killed in the bedroom, but the prosecution expert said that the victim was killed in the living room. And I think, if you look at the opinion, the court says that the prosecution expert's testimony is the more credible testimony, and so, therefore, the defense expert's testimony is not credible.

And I think the other way to look at it, I think, is that if you look at the -- the -- the -- the -- the opinion of the court, the court makes two other factual findings that I think are quite telling.

Now, if you look at the record, the only evidence that the victim was killed in the living room is the testimony of the prosecution expert, and the only evidence that the victim was killed in the course of the robbery is the testimony of the prosecution expert. And so I think, if you look at those two findings, I think it's clear that the court is relying on the testimony of the prosecution expert.

Steeley<\/speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Section 301(b)(1)(C) of the Clean Water Act assigns EPA the job of setting the effluent limitations necessary to meet and implement water quality standards. The water quality standards are not the limitations themselves. Instead, they set the goals for the water body. EPA must translate those goals into discharge limitations. The Generic Prohibitions fail this task. As Judge Collins explained below, the Generic Prohibitions erase the distinction between water quality standards and discharge limitations, making them one and the same. The Generic Prohibitions revive the very \"cause or contribute\" standard Congress repealed. And they do not function as discharge limitations. As the Second Circuit recognized, they add nothing that tells a permitholder how  to control its discharges. EPA claims it uses the Generic Prohibitions as a backstop, an insurance policy against changing circumstances. But the Clean  Water Act already gives EPA all the tools it needs to address uncertainty. EPA can reopen, modify, or terminate a permit when conditions change, and it can exercise its statutory authority to protect public welfare in emergencies. What EPA cannot do is expose permitholders to liability based on receiving water conditions it cannot control. The Generic Prohibitions are also inconsistent with the Act's permit shield. The shield protects permitholders from liability as long as they comply with their permit terms. But, by imposing indeterminate requirements, the Generic Prohibitions prevent permitholders from relying on the shield's protections. San Francisco is therefore exposed to crushing criminal and civil penalties even when it otherwise complies with its 300-page permit.

And so that's what the Ninth Circuit said. The Ninth Circuit said that the discharge of pollutants is what you're measuring. And, in fact, the Ninth Circuit said that you can't do that in the Bay because there are so many different sources of pollutants that it would be impossible to measure it. And so it said that the discharge from the MS4 is the only thing that you can measure, and it's the only thing that you can regulate. So how do you write around that and say that the statute permits you to do what you did, which is to say that we can't measure it, so we're going to do something else?  I -- I -- I don't see how you get there.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Frederick Liu:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, the -- the Ninth Circuit's understanding of the term \"discharge\" is inconsistent with this Court's precedents. In Miccosukee, this Court held that the term \"discharge\" refers to the point source itself. And the Ninth Circuit's understanding of the term \"discharge\" is inconsistent with the text of the statute. The statute defines the term \"discharge\" to mean a discharge of pollutants. And so, if the Ninth Circuit's interpretation were correct, that would mean that the term \"discharge\" means a discharge of pollutants of pollutants, which makes no sense.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, counsel, that's what the statute says, a discharge of any pollutant. So it's not a discharge of discharge of pollutants. It's a discharge of any pollutant. And so it seems to me that that's what the Ninth Circuit was saying, which is you have to measure the discharge of any pollutant.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Frederick Liu:  Justice Sotomayor, I think, if you look at the definition of the term \"discharge\" in 1342(e), it defines \"discharge\" to mean a discharge of pollutants. So, if the Ninth Circuit's interpretation were correct, that would mean that the term \"discharge\" means a discharge of pollutants of pollutants, which makes no sense. And so I think the Court's precedents and the text of the statute make clear that the term \"discharge\" refers to the point source itself.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you're not measuring the point source. You're measuring the effect of the discharge of the pollutant. That's what you're measuring. You're not measuring the discharge. You're measuring the effect of the discharge.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Frederick Liu:  Well, I think, in this case, we are measuring the discharge. We're measuring the discharge of MS4s. And -- and, in fact, I think, if you look at the limitations at issue here, they all refer to discharges. They talk about discharge monitoring reports. They talk about the discharge of certain pollutants. They talk about the discharge of MS4s. So I think the -- the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of the term \"discharge\" is just inconsistent with the text of the statute and this Court's precedents.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Thank you, counsel.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Mr. Liu, if I could take you back to the colloquy that you were just having with Justice Thomas. I mean, I -- I take it that you're saying that there are some circumstances in which you can regulate on the basis of water quality, is that correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Frederick Liu:  That's correct.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  And if that's right, why don't you have some kind of burden of production?  In other words, why isn't the right way to think about this that you can regulate on the basis of water quality, but you have to come forward with a showing that you really can't do it in any other way?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Frederick Liu:  Well, I think the reason why we think that that's not the right way to think about it is because that's not the way Congress wrote the statute. And -- and this gets back to Justice Sotomayor's question about the -- the Ninth Circuit's understanding of the term \"discharge.\"  I mean, the statute tells you what you're supposed to measure. You're supposed to measure the discharge of pollutants. And that's a point source.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  I mean, I guess what I'm suggesting is that there are some circumstances in which it's just not possible to measure the discharge of pollutants, and everybody knows that, and it's not worth putting a lot of money into it, and it's just obvious. And why shouldn't the burden be on the government to say that's so?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Frederick Liu:  Well, I think the -- the statute does not speak in terms of what is obvious or what is not obvious. I think the statute speaks in terms of what is measurable and what is not measurable. And I think the -- the -- the -- the problem with San Francisco's position is that it would effectively read the term \"discharge\" out of the statute. And if you look at the provisions of the statute that I was discussing with Justice Thomas, 1311(b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), (b)(1)(C), they all refer to discharges. And so, if you read the term \"discharge\" to mean something other than what this Court has always understood it to mean, which is the point source itself, then you're effectively reading the term \"discharge\" out of the statute.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Thank you, Mr. Liu.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I'd like to return to where Justice Thomas left off. Is it your position that water quality is always measurable?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Frederick Liu:  No, it's not. It's not always measurable. And I think that's why Congress in 1972 wrote the statute the way it did. It said, look, you're supposed to measure the discharge of pollutants. And if you can't measure the discharge of pollutants, you're supposed to measure the water quality.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  So -- so it is sometimes impossible to measure water quality?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Frederick Liu:  It is sometimes impossible to measure water quality.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  And when that happens, what do you do?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Frederick Liu:  When that happens, you're supposed to measure the discharge of pollutants.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  But you can't measure the discharge of pollutants in this case.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Frederick Liu:  Well, that's -- that's right. But, here, it's not that you can't measure the discharge of pollutants. It's that you can't measure the discharge of pollutants in the receiving waters.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I see.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Frederick Liu:  You can measure the discharge of pollutants at the point source.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  So it's sometimes impossible to measure water quality in the receiving waters?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <END_Q><|eot_id|>","cleaned":"        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Mr. Liu, I have a basic problem, which is, if you read the statute, it says that you're supposed to measure the discharge of pollutants in the receiving waters. And so that's what the Ninth Circuit said. The Ninth Circuit said that the discharge of pollutants is what you're measuring. And, in fact, the Ninth Circuit said that you can't do that in the Bay because there are so many different sources of pollutants that it would be impossible to measure it. And so it said that the discharge from the MS4 is the only thing that you can measure, and it's the only thing that you can regulate. So how do you write around that and say that the statute permits you to do what you did, which is to say that we can't measure it, so we're going to do something else?  I -- I -- I don't see how you get there.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Frederick Liu:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, the -- the Ninth Circuit's understanding of the term \"discharge\" is inconsistent with this Court's precedents. In Miccosukee, this Court held that the term \"discharge\" refers to the point source itself. And the Ninth Circuit's understanding of the term \"discharge\" is inconsistent with the text of the statute. The statute defines the term \"discharge\" to mean a discharge of pollutants. And so, if the Ninth Circuit's interpretation were correct, that would mean that the term \"discharge\" means a discharge of pollutants of pollutants, which makes no sense.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, counsel, that's what the statute says, a discharge of any pollutant. So it's not a discharge of discharge of pollutants. It's a discharge of any pollutant. And so it seems to me that that's what the Ninth Circuit was saying, which is you have to measure the discharge of any pollutant.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Frederick Liu:  Justice Sotomayor, I think, if you look at the definition of the term \"discharge\" in 1342(e), it defines \"discharge\" to mean a discharge of pollutants. So, if the Ninth Circuit's interpretation were correct, that would mean that the term \"discharge\" means a discharge of pollutants of pollutants, which makes no sense. And so I think the Court's precedents and the text of the statute make clear that the term \"discharge\" refers to the point source itself.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you're not measuring the point source. You're measuring the effect of the discharge of the pollutant. That's what you're measuring. You're not measuring the discharge. You're measuring the effect of the discharge.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Frederick Liu:  Well, I think, in this case, we are measuring the discharge. We're measuring the discharge of MS4s. And -- and, in fact, I think, if you look at the limitations at issue here, they all refer to discharges. They talk about discharge monitoring reports. They talk about the discharge of certain pollutants. They talk about the discharge of MS4s. So I think the -- the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of the term \"discharge\" is just inconsistent with the text of the statute and this Court's precedents.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Thank you, counsel.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G.

In other words, why isn't the right way to think about this that you can regulate on the basis of water quality, but you have to come forward with a showing that you really can't do it in any other way?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Frederick Liu:  Well, I think the reason why we think that that's not the right way to think about it is because that's not the way Congress wrote the statute. And -- and this gets back to Justice Sotomayor's question about the -- the Ninth Circuit's understanding of the term \"discharge.\"  I mean, the statute tells you what you're supposed to measure. You're supposed to measure the discharge of pollutants. And that's a point source.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  I mean, I guess what I'm suggesting is that there are some circumstances in which it's just not possible to measure the discharge of pollutants, and everybody knows that, and it's not worth putting a lot of money into it, and it's just obvious. And why shouldn't the burden be on the government to say that's so?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Frederick Liu:  Well, I think the -- the statute does not speak in terms of what is obvious or what is not obvious. I think the statute speaks in terms of what is measurable and what is not measurable. And I think the -- the -- the -- the problem with San Francisco's position is that it would effectively read the term \"discharge\" out of the statute. And if you look at the provisions of the statute that I was discussing with Justice Thomas, 1311(b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), (b)(1)(C), they all refer to discharges.

Wellington<\/speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Eighth Circuit's decision below is an extreme outlier. It conflicts with the text and structure of Section 1367 and with more than a century of precedent. Chief Justice Marshall held in Mollan against Torrance in 1824 that in a diversity case, a federal court's jurisdiction once vested cannot be divested by subsequent events. The Court extended that reasoning to removal actions in Kirby against American Soda in 1904. And in 1938, this Court held in St. Paul  Mercury that if the plaintiff after removal amends his pleadings, this does not deprive the district court of jurisdiction because the defendant's statutory right to removal should not be subject to the plaintiff's caprice. The second Justice Marshall confirmed that conclusion in Carnegie -Mellon against Cohill in 1988, and Justice Scalia concurred in Rockwell in 2007. Respondents ask this Court to upset that settled interpretation, claiming that it conflicts with the text of Section 1367. But  Congress codified this Court's longstanding precedent in the text of Section 1367 itself, making clear that if the federal court has original jurisdiction, it shall continue to have supplemental jurisdiction unless Congress expressly provided otherwise. Respondents cannot cite a single decision of this Court, a single decision of a court of appeals outside of the Eighth Circuit, or a single treatise that supports their position. Respondents realize how weak their case is and instead ask the Court to decide something else, whether Grable should be overruled and, if not, whether Grable's requirements were met. This Court did not grant certiorari on either question. Grable is settled law, and the Eighth Circuit correctly applied it here.

I'm going to give you a simple example. I have a complaint that alleges both a federal question and a state question, and I file it in federal court. You're saying that the district court has jurisdiction over that federal claim, correct?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And then I file an amended complaint that drops the federal question and keeps the state question. You're saying that the district court still has jurisdiction over the state claim, correct?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you're also saying that if I file that same complaint, the first complaint, in state court and I allege both the federal and the state question, that the defendant can't remove the case to federal court, correct?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  If the plaintiff has not pleaded around the federal claim, then yes, that's correct.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Now isn't that a different answer than what Justice Jackson just heard from the other side?  The other side is saying that if I file that same complaint in state court and allege both federal and state claims, that the defendant can remove the case to federal court, correct?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why would you say that if I file it in federal court that the district court has jurisdiction, but if I file it in state court, the district court doesn't have jurisdiction?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Well, if the plaintiff has pleaded around the federal claim, then there's no jurisdiction. But if the plaintiff has not pleaded around the federal claim, then there is jurisdiction.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So the plaintiff --<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  That's the test.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  -- the plaintiff has to plead around it?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So the plaintiff can plead it and then drop it and the district court would still have jurisdiction?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But the plaintiff can't plead it in state court and have the defendant remove it?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  No, that's not what I'm saying. If the plaintiff pleads it in state court, then the defendant can remove it. If the plaintiff pleads around it, then the defendant cannot remove it.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So that's the difference between the two positions?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  The other side is saying that if I plead it in state court, the defendant can't remove it.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B.

Justice Gorsuch?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Just to follow up on Justice Sotomayor's question, I just want to make sure I understand, counsel. You -- you agree that if the plaintiff pleads around a federal claim, the defendant can't remove, right?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And then the question is, once you're in federal court, if the plaintiff drops the federal claim, does the case remain there or does it go back to state court?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  It remains in federal court, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And -- and -- and that's because of 1441(a), right?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  And -- and the savings clause in 1441 doesn't apply to 1331?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  No, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And then, with respect to 1367, that's just icing on the cake for you, right?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And then, with respect to the Eighth Circuit's decision, it didn't turn on 1367. It turned on 1441. Is that right?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  But I would like to --<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  And then, with respect to Grable, that's a 1331 question, right?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  And it doesn't have anything to do with 1441?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And then, lastly, I'm sorry to belabor this, but I just want to make sure I understand. With -- with respect to the Eighth Circuit's decision, it was wrong to say that 1441 is limited to original jurisdiction?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. So, if -- if the plaintiff pleads around a federal claim and the defendant can't remove it, that's a 1331 question, right?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  And I would like to just add that --<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And then the Eighth Circuit didn't reach that question, though, did it?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  No, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. All right. Thank you.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kavanaugh?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Just to follow up on that, the -- the removal question is a 1441 question, not a 1331 question, correct?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. And then, on 1331, the question, I think, is whether there's an embedded jurisdictional requirement in 1331, correct?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  And that's what Grable addresses.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Right. Okay. And then, on the second issue, the second question presented, it's not an embedded jurisdictional requirement, but it's a question of whether 1331 is satisfied, correct?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  And that's what the Eighth Circuit addressed.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then, on the first question presented, the embedded jurisdictional requirement, the Chief Justice and Justice Kagan and Justice Sotomayor have all asked questions about the purposes of 1331 and why we would have a federal forum for a particular claim, and I want to give you a chance to respond to that. I think, in the past, you've said that the purposes of 1331 include avoiding bias against out-of -state defendants, ensuring uniformity of decisions, and providing a more efficient system for resolving complex cases. So I just want to give you a chance to respond to the questions that have been posed to you on the first question presented.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Thank you, Justice Kavanaugh. I think the most important point is that this Court has repeatedly said that 1331 is a broad grant of jurisdiction. And, in fact, the Court said that in Grable itself. And the Court has also said that if Congress wants to limit that jurisdiction, it has to do so clearly and textually. And, here, we have a case where the text of 1441(a) does not limit the jurisdiction. In fact, the text of 1441(a) says that if the federal court has original jurisdiction, then the defendant can remove. And, here, the federal court had original jurisdiction. So the text of 1441(a) is not ambiguous. It is clear. And, in fact, the Eighth Circuit's decision is an extreme outlier. It is contrary to all of the other courts of appeals that have addressed this issue. And it's contrary to the majority of district courts that have addressed this issue. So I think that's the most important point. And I would like to go back to the text of 1441(a) because I think that is the most important point. The text of 1441(a) says that if the federal court has original jurisdiction, then the defendant can remove. And, here, the federal court had original jurisdiction. And, in fact, the Eighth Circuit did not say that the federal court did not have original jurisdiction. The Eighth Circuit said that the federal court had original jurisdiction, but then it said that 1441(a) limits that jurisdiction to original jurisdiction. And that is contrary to the plain text of 1441(a). 1441(a) says if the federal court has original jurisdiction, then the defendant can remove. And, here, the federal court had original jurisdiction.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Thank you.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Barrett?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  So, counsel, I just want to make sure I understand your position on the second question presented. You're not asking us to decide whether Grable is satisfied here, right?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And so you're asking us to decide that question on the assumption that Grable is satisfied?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And so, if we assume that Grable is satisfied, then you win, right?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And then you're saying that 1441(a) does not impose an additional limit?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So you're saying that the only limit is Grable?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And then, if we disagree with you on that and we say, oh, no, 1441(a) does impose an additional limit, then we have to decide whether Grable is satisfied?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And then, if we say that Grable is satisfied, then you win, but if we say Grable is not satisfied, then you lose?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And -- and so, if we say that Grable is not satisfied, then you lose, but you can still remove under 1441(a) --<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  -- because you have a different federal claim?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And then --<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  And that's the point of --<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Yeah.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  -- that's the point of 1441(a).<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And then the district court would decide whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim, right?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So the only difference between the two positions, if we disagree with you about whether 1441(a) imposes an additional limit, is whether the district court would have to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And so it's really just a difference between original and supplemental jurisdiction?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. And then, lastly, counsel, you said that this was an extreme outlier. How many courts of appeals have addressed this question?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  I believe six courts of appeals have addressed this question.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And so they've all adopted your position?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  They have all adopted our position, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. Thank you.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Jackson?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  Yes. So I guess I'm a little concerned about the extent to which we're sort of conflating these two different concepts, and I just want to make sure I understand.

Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. And then, on 1331, the question, I think, is whether there's an embedded jurisdictional requirement in 1331, correct?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B.

And then, on the second issue, the second question presented, it's not an embedded jurisdictional requirement, but it's a question of whether 1331 is satisfied, correct?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  And that's what the Eighth Circuit addressed.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then, on the first question presented, the embedded jurisdictional requirement, the Chief Justice and Justice Kagan and Justice Sotomayor have all asked questions about the purposes of 1331 and why we would have a federal forum for a particular claim, and I want to give you a chance to respond to that. I think, in the past, you've said that the purposes of 1331 include avoiding bias against out-of -state defendants, ensuring uniformity of decisions, and providing a more efficient system for resolving complex cases. So I just want to give you a chance to respond to the questions that have been posed to you on the first question presented.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Thank you, Justice Kavanaugh. I think the most important point is that this Court has repeatedly said that 1331 is a broad grant of jurisdiction. And, in fact, the Court said that in Grable itself. And the Court has also said that if Congress wants to limit that jurisdiction, it has to do so clearly and textually. And, here, we have a case where the text of 1441(a) does not limit the jurisdiction. In fact, the text of 1441(a) says that if the federal court has original jurisdiction, then the defendant can remove. And, here, the federal court had original jurisdiction. So the text of 1441(a) is not ambiguous. It is clear. And, in fact, the Eighth Circuit's decision is an extreme outlier. It is contrary to all of the other courts of appeals that have addressed this issue. And it's contrary to the majority of district courts that have addressed this issue. So I think that's the most important point. And I would like to go back to the text of 1441(a) because I think that is the most important point. The text of 1441(a) says that if the federal court has original jurisdiction, then the defendant can remove. And, here, the federal court had original jurisdiction. And, in fact, the Eighth Circuit did not say that the federal court did not have original jurisdiction. The Eighth Circuit said that the federal court had original jurisdiction, but then it said that 1441(a) limits that jurisdiction to original jurisdiction. And that is contrary to the plain text of 1441(a). 1441(a) says if the federal court has original jurisdiction, then the defendant can remove. And, here, the federal court had original jurisdiction.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Thank you.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Barrett?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  So, counsel, I just want to make sure I understand your position on the second question presented. You're not asking us to decide whether Grable is satisfied here, right?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And so you're asking us to decide that question on the assumption that Grable is satisfied?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And so, if we assume that Grable is satisfied, then you win, right?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And then you're saying that 1441(a) does not impose an additional limit?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So you're saying that the only limit is Grable?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And then, if we disagree with you on that and we say, oh, no, 1441(a) does impose an additional limit, then we have to decide whether Grable is satisfied?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And then, if we say that Grable is satisfied, then you win, but if we say Grable is not satisfied, then you lose?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And -- and so, if we say that Grable is not satisfied, then you lose, but you can still remove under 1441(a) --<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  -- because you have a different federal claim?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And then --<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  And that's the point of --<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Yeah.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  -- that's the point of 1441(a).<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And then the district court would decide whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim, right?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So the only difference between the two positions, if we disagree with you about whether 1441(a) imposes an additional limit, is whether the district court would have to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And so it's really just a difference between original and supplemental jurisdiction?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  Yes, Your Honor.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. And then, lastly, counsel, you said that this was an extreme outlier. How many courts of appeals have addressed this question?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B. Wellington:  I believe six courts of appeals have addressed this question.<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And so they've all adopted your position?<\/text><END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Katherine B.

And experience should have taught us by now that a suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action. That should be the definitive test for arising under jurisdiction for at least three reasons. It's the most faithful to the text, it avoids serious constitutional problems, and it will save decades of pointless litigation over jurisdiction. Now, if you're not yet ready to re-embrace American Well Works, and it sounds like you might not be, I suspect that stare decisis does a fair bit of work, in which case stare decisis applies an easy alternative path to affirm. This case is Merrell Dow but for  pets not people. And while I take a back seat to nobody in my love of our four-legged friends, I am confident Congress believed that misbranded human product was a more substantial federal issue than misbranded pet food. If we turn to which complaint controls, the Eighth Circuit again should be affirmed. My friend and I crucially agree the text of 1367 is dispositive here. And, remarkably, we also agree, if this case were originally in federal court, it must be dismissed. Why?  Because, by amending out all of the federal issues, they're no longer in the action. If that's what the text of 1367 means for an original case, how can the exact same words take on a different meaning with removal?  Despite my friend's professed commitment to textualism, she has no choice but  to flee to public policy. We can't have these mischievous plaintiffs' lawyers shopping around for their judges, we're told. Now that concern  is not happening in the real world, and my friend's solution wouldn't solve the problem even if it were. But none of that matters. This Court has said many times that text trumps policy. You merely need to say so once again in order to affirm.

Below is an opening statement from a Supreme Court case and the name of a specific justice. Your task is to generate a list of questions that this justice is likely to ask in response to the opening statement. These questions should reflect the justice\u2019s known priorities, jurisprudence, and typical questioning style, and they should be directly relevant to the arguments presented in the opening statement.\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Carefully analyze the opening statement to identify key arguments, assumptions, or ambiguities.\n        2. Generate questions that the specified justice might ask. Limit to 15 or less questions. Do not repeat questions.\n        3. Format each question with specific start and end tags for easier parsing:\n           - Use `<START_Q>` at the beginning of each question.\n           - Use `<END_Q>` at the end of each question.\n\n        ### Example:\n        ### Your Task:\n        Justice: {justice_name}\n        Opening Statement: {opening_statement}\n\n        ### Output:\n        A list of questions that {justice_name} is likely to ask:\n        <START_Q> text of question one <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> text of question two <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> text of question three <END_Q><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Your Task:\n        Justice: Justice Sonia Sotomayor\n        Opening Statement: <speaker>Ashley C.

I don't disagree with you that the text controls, but I do have a problem with your textual argument. You seem to be suggesting that the text of 1367(a) requires a court to dismiss a claim if it lacks jurisdiction over the claim. But the text doesn't say that. It says, if the court determines that it would have original jurisdiction but for the failure of joinder or misjoinder of parties, it may exercise jurisdiction over each claim. I don't see the language that you're talking about.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  So, Justice Sotomayor, the way I would read the text of 1367(a) is, if there's a claim that would not be part of the action but for the joinder or misjoinder of parties, then you can't exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But it doesn't say that either.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  Well, I think --<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  It says if you would have original jurisdiction, you may exercise it.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  Well, I think the \"but for\" language means if there's a claim that would not be part of the action but for the joinder or misjoinder of parties, then you can't exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it. And I think that's --<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why don't you answer the question that Justice Kagan asked your adversary?  If there's a claim that would have been within the jurisdiction of the court, but it's joined with another claim that would have been within the jurisdiction of the court, and the plaintiff then dismisses the first claim, do you think the court has to dismiss the second claim?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  If the court would have had jurisdiction over the second claim originally, then it can continue to exercise jurisdiction over it. That's the whole point of 1367(a).<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So what you're really saying is that if the court would have had original jurisdiction, it can keep the claim, but if it wouldn't have had original jurisdiction, it can't keep the claim?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  That is the whole point of 1367(a), yes.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So that's the question that we have to ask, which is, if the plaintiff had only filed the second claim, would the court have had original jurisdiction?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  Yes.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And you say yes it would have?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  Yes. And I think that's the whole point of 1367(a), is that you can have claims that are within the court's jurisdiction and claims that are not, and if you have claims that are within the court's jurisdiction, then it can continue to exercise jurisdiction over them. But, if you have a claim that is not within the court's jurisdiction, then it cannot exercise jurisdiction over it.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if it's not within the court's jurisdiction, it can't exercise jurisdiction over it, period, end of story?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Counsel, I  -- I think I understood your friend to say that the  -- the only difference between the two of you is the one that Justice Sotomayor just identified. In other words, if the claim that remains is not within the court's jurisdiction, you would say the court has to dismiss it, but your friend would say it's up to the court. Is that the only difference?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Okay. And then you said, well, you know, that's just what the text says. But I wonder if the text really does say that. I mean, the  --the text talks about claims that would not be part of the same case but for the joinder or misjoinder of parties. Now I think it would be natural to read that to mean claims that would not be part of the same case but for the joinder or misjoinder of parties that provide jurisdiction. In other words, if you have two claims, one of them is jurisdictional, one is not, and they're joined, and then the jurisdictional one is dismissed, then the other one would not be part of the same case but for the joinder of the jurisdictional one. But, if you have two claims, neither of which provides jurisdiction, and they're joined and one of them is dismissed, then the other one would not be part of the same case but for the joinder or misjoinder of the other claim that didn't provide jurisdiction. So I guess I wonder if your reading is really compelled by the text.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  Well, I think it is, Your Honor, and I think that's the way that courts have always read the text. And so, if you look at the cases that my friend cites, they're all about  -- they're all about claims that would have been within the court's jurisdiction originally. And so, if you take a look at the cases that she cites, they all involve cases where there is a jurisdictionally sound claim and then there is a jurisdictionally unsound claim. And then, when the jurisdictionally sound claim is dismissed, the courts continue to exercise jurisdiction over the jurisdictionally unsound claim. That is not this case. This is a case where there's a jurisdictionally unsound claim and a jurisdictionally unsound claim, and then the jurisdictionally unsound claim is dismissed. And so I think that that's the key difference.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but I guess I'm not sure that that's the only difference. I mean, if you have two claims, neither of which provides jurisdiction, and they're joined, and then one of them is dismissed, why isn't it the case that the other one would not be part of the same case but for the joinder of the other one?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  Because I think that the language that you just quoted, Your Honor, is talking about the joinder or misjoinder of parties, not the joinder or misjoinder of claims.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but it's the joinder or misjoinder of parties that provides jurisdiction, right?  That's what  --that's what 1332 is about.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  Well, that's not what 1332 is about. 1332 is about the amount in controversy and complete diversity. But, in any event, I don't think that that's the right way to read the statute. I think that the statute is talking about the joinder or misjoinder of parties, not the joinder or misjoinder of claims.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but you need the parties to have the claims, right?  I mean, you need to have the parties to have the claims.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  Well, I -- I think that's right, Your Honor, but I think that that's not the right way to read the statute. I think that the statute is talking about the joinder or misjoinder of parties, and I think that that's the way that courts have always read it. And so, if you look at the cases that my friend cites, they're all about cases where there is a jurisdictionally sound claim and then there is a jurisdictionally unsound claim. And then, when the jurisdictionally sound claim is dismissed, the courts continue to exercise jurisdiction over the jurisdictionally unsound claim. That is not this case. This is a case where there's a jurisdictionally unsound claim and a jurisdictionally unsound claim, and then the jurisdictionally unsound claim is dismissed. And so I think that that's the key difference.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Alito?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I just want to follow up on a question that you were asked previously. What would happen if the plaintiff had filed the second claim first, the claim that is not within the jurisdiction of the federal court, and then later amended to add the claim that is within the jurisdiction of the federal court?  Would that be a different situation?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  I think that that would be a different situation, Your Honor, because I think that the -- the  --the point of 1367(a) is to allow plaintiffs to bring all of their claims together in one action, and then, if the  -- if the anchor claim drops out, then the court can continue to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims. And so, if the plaintiff never brought the anchor claim, then I think that the court would not have original jurisdiction over the remaining claims, and, therefore, it would not be able to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over them.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Sotomayor?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I -- I'm a little confused. I always thought that 1367 was passed to deal with the situation of plaintiffs joining claims that had no independent jurisdiction and claims that did have independent jurisdiction. And the whole point of 1367 was to say, if you have claims that are really joined, you can bring them together, and we're not going to worry about the independent jurisdiction of the second claim. You're now suggesting that if there are two claims that are joined, both of which have no independent jurisdiction, the court has to dismiss them?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go to the Chief Justice's question, which is, if they're joined in the original complaint, but there's no independent jurisdiction, then what?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  Well, then I think the court would have to dismiss the case, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So you're basically saying that 1367 is limited to situations where there's at least one claim that has independent jurisdiction?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go back to my first question. If there are two claims, both of which have no independent jurisdiction, and they're joined in the original complaint, the court has to dismiss them?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  That's right, Your Honor. I think that's the whole point of the well-pleaded complaint rule, is that you look at the plaintiff's complaint and ask, do any of the claims in the complaint set forth a basis for federal jurisdiction?  And if none of them do, then the court has to dismiss the case.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And so the whole point of 1367 is to say, if you have claims that are joined that have independent jurisdiction and claims that don't, you can keep the ones that don't because they're joined with claims that do?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  That's right, Your Honor. And -- and, again, I think that that's the whole point of 1367(a), is to allow plaintiffs to bring all of their claims together in one action, and then, if the anchor claim drops out, then the court can continue to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims. But, if the plaintiff never brought the anchor claim, then the court would not be able to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And what do you do with the fact that the statute speaks about claims that arise under federal law?  You're saying that even if the claims arise under federal law, if they're joined with other claims that arise under federal law, the court has to dismiss them?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  No, Your Honor, I'm not saying that. I'm saying that if there are claims that arise under federal law and they're joined with other claims that arise under federal law, then the court can continue to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over all of those claims. But, if there are claims that arise under federal law and they're joined with other claims that don't arise under federal law, then, if the claims that arise under federal law drop out, the court can no longer exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Thank you, counsel.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Can you just finish your answer to Justice Alito's question?  I want to make sure I understood it. He said two claims, both arise under federal law, but neither of them is worth $75,000, and you said the court would have to dismiss those claims if they were originally filed in federal court together?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  Yes, that's right, Your Honor, because the court would not have original jurisdiction over them.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. And then pick up on -- Justice Sotomayor was asking you about the point of 1367, and you said to allow plaintiffs to bring all their claims together in one action. But why wouldn't the point of 1367 also be to allow plaintiffs to bring all their claims together in one action even if none of them have an independent jurisdictional basis?  In other words, that's what the statute seems to do, allow you to bring claims together in one action even if none of them have an independent jurisdictional basis.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  Well, I don't think that's the point of 1367(a), Your Honor, because I think that that would be a sea change in the way this Court has always approached jurisdiction. And I think that the point of 1367(a) is to allow plaintiffs to bring all of their claims together in one action and then, if the anchor claim drops out, to allow the court to continue to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims. But, if the plaintiff never brings the anchor claim, then I think the court would not be able to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Barrett?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  So, Mr. Keller, I want to make sure I understand your position. Justice Kavanaugh pointed out that 1331 and 1332 are not mutually exclusive, and so you could have a claim that arises under federal law but also satisfies 1332. And I think you told Justice Kavanaugh that if those claims were brought together originally, the district court would have to dismiss them because the 1332 claim didn't have an independent jurisdictional basis. Is that correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So let's imagine that the plaintiff then refiles, but this time he files the 1332 claim first and then the claim that arises under federal law. You agree that that would be okay, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  I agree that that would be okay, yes.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So let's imagine that the plaintiff files the 1332 claim first, and then the defendant moves to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiff hasn't pleaded the amount in controversy. So the plaintiff amends the complaint to plead the amount in controversy. Now, at that point, the court has original jurisdiction, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  That's right, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. And then the plaintiff adds the claim that arises under federal law. At that point, the court would have supplemental jurisdiction over the claim that arises under federal law?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  That's right, Your Honor.<\/text","cleaned":"        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I -- I'm not sure I understand the logic of your argument.

Roberts, Jr.:  Counsel, I  -- I think I understood your friend to say that the  -- the only difference between the two of you is the one that Justice Sotomayor just identified. In other words, if the claim that remains is not within the court's jurisdiction, you would say the court has to dismiss it, but your friend would say it's up to the court. Is that the only difference?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Okay. And then you said, well, you know, that's just what the text says. But I wonder if the text really does say that. I mean, the  --the text talks about claims that would not be part of the same case but for the joinder or misjoinder of parties. Now I think it would be natural to read that to mean claims that would not be part of the same case but for the joinder or misjoinder of parties that provide jurisdiction. In other words, if you have two claims, one of them is jurisdictional, one is not, and they're joined, and then the jurisdictional one is dismissed, then the other one would not be part of the same case but for the joinder of the jurisdictional one. But, if you have two claims, neither of which provides jurisdiction, and they're joined and one of them is dismissed, then the other one would not be part of the same case but for the joinder or misjoinder of the other claim that didn't provide jurisdiction. So I guess I wonder if your reading is really compelled by the text.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  Well, I think it is, Your Honor, and I think that's the way that courts have always read the text. And so, if you look at the cases that my friend cites, they're all about  -- they're all about claims that would have been within the court's jurisdiction originally. And so, if you take a look at the cases that she cites, they all involve cases where there is a jurisdictionally sound claim and then there is a jurisdictionally unsound claim. And then, when the jurisdictionally sound claim is dismissed, the courts continue to exercise jurisdiction over the jurisdictionally unsound claim. That is not this case. This is a case where there's a jurisdictionally unsound claim and a jurisdictionally unsound claim, and then the jurisdictionally unsound claim is dismissed. And so I think that that's the key difference.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but I guess I'm not sure that that's the only difference. I mean, if you have two claims, neither of which provides jurisdiction, and they're joined, and then one of them is dismissed, why isn't it the case that the other one would not be part of the same case but for the joinder of the other one?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C.

Keller:  Well, that's not what 1332 is about. 1332 is about the amount in controversy and complete diversity. But, in any event, I don't think that that's the right way to read the statute. I think that the statute is talking about the joinder or misjoinder of parties, not the joinder or misjoinder of claims.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G.

Keller:  Well, I -- I think that's right, Your Honor, but I think that that's not the right way to read the statute.

Justice Alito?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I just want to follow up on a question that you were asked previously. What would happen if the plaintiff had filed the second claim first, the claim that is not within the jurisdiction of the federal court, and then later amended to add the claim that is within the jurisdiction of the federal court?  Would that be a different situation?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  I think that that would be a different situation, Your Honor, because I think that the -- the  --the point of 1367(a) is to allow plaintiffs to bring all of their claims together in one action, and then, if the  -- if the anchor claim drops out, then the court can continue to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims. And so, if the plaintiff never brought the anchor claim, then I think that the court would not have original jurisdiction over the remaining claims, and, therefore, it would not be able to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over them.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A.

I always thought that 1367 was passed to deal with the situation of plaintiffs joining claims that had no independent jurisdiction and claims that did have independent jurisdiction. And the whole point of 1367 was to say, if you have claims that are really joined, you can bring them together, and we're not going to worry about the independent jurisdiction of the second claim. You're now suggesting that if there are two claims that are joined, both of which have no independent jurisdiction, the court has to dismiss them?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go to the Chief Justice's question, which is, if they're joined in the original complaint, but there's no independent jurisdiction, then what?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  Well, then I think the court would have to dismiss the case, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So you're basically saying that 1367 is limited to situations where there's at least one claim that has independent jurisdiction?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go back to my first question. If there are two claims, both of which have no independent jurisdiction, and they're joined in the original complaint, the court has to dismiss them?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  That's right, Your Honor. I think that's the whole point of the well-pleaded complaint rule, is that you look at the plaintiff's complaint and ask, do any of the claims in the complaint set forth a basis for federal jurisdiction?  And if none of them do, then the court has to dismiss the case.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And so the whole point of 1367 is to say, if you have claims that are joined that have independent jurisdiction and claims that don't, you can keep the ones that don't because they're joined with claims that do?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  That's right, Your Honor. And -- and, again, I think that that's the whole point of 1367(a), is to allow plaintiffs to bring all of their claims together in one action, and then, if the anchor claim drops out, then the court can continue to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims. But, if the plaintiff never brought the anchor claim, then the court would not be able to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And what do you do with the fact that the statute speaks about claims that arise under federal law?  You're saying that even if the claims arise under federal law, if they're joined with other claims that arise under federal law, the court has to dismiss them?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  No, Your Honor, I'm not saying that. I'm saying that if there are claims that arise under federal law and they're joined with other claims that arise under federal law, then the court can continue to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over all of those claims. But, if there are claims that arise under federal law and they're joined with other claims that don't arise under federal law, then, if the claims that arise under federal law drop out, the court can no longer exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right.

Kavanaugh:  Can you just finish your answer to Justice Alito's question?  I want to make sure I understood it. He said two claims, both arise under federal law, but neither of them is worth $75,000, and you said the court would have to dismiss those claims if they were originally filed in federal court together?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C.

And then pick up on -- Justice Sotomayor was asking you about the point of 1367, and you said to allow plaintiffs to bring all their claims together in one action. But why wouldn't the point of 1367 also be to allow plaintiffs to bring all their claims together in one action even if none of them have an independent jurisdictional basis?

Justice Kavanaugh pointed out that 1331 and 1332 are not mutually exclusive, and so you could have a claim that arises under federal law but also satisfies 1332. And I think you told Justice Kavanaugh that if those claims were brought together originally, the district court would have to dismiss them because the 1332 claim didn't have an independent jurisdictional basis. Is that correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  That's correct, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So let's imagine that the plaintiff then refiles, but this time he files the 1332 claim first and then the claim that arises under federal law. You agree that that would be okay, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  I agree that that would be okay, yes.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. So let's imagine that the plaintiff files the 1332 claim first, and then the defendant moves to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiff hasn't pleaded the amount in controversy. So the plaintiff amends the complaint to plead the amount in controversy. Now, at that point, the court has original jurisdiction, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Ashley C. Keller:  That's right, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. And then the plaintiff adds the claim that arises under federal law.

In context, that requirement applies not just to the day of approval but to the next day as well. In other words, the petition cannot remain approved if the agency reconsiders its initial decision and concludes that there was a sham marriage. That's because an approved visa petition confers no substantive benefits. It is simply a piece of paper signifying that a beneficiary is eligible to apply for a green card. If Congress believed you shouldn't get that piece of paper saying that you're eligible when you've been in a sham marriage, then -- then the agency has to take it away when it determines that you're not, in fact, eligible. That resolves this case. Because the revocation here was non-discretionary, it is reviewable. The government seeks to shield  itself from judicial review by claiming it has discretion to not revoke the petition even after a sham -marriage finding. Yet it identifies no circumstance in which it has ever or would ever exercise that purported discretion. Nor does it explain what purpose such discretion could serve if, as the government appears to believe, it's not actually allowed to give the beneficiary a green card. The discretion appears to simply be the discretion to allow a person to hold on to a now meaningless piece of paper that has been drained of all of its value. That cannot be the kind  of discretion that Congress sought to protect. The government's view also layers one anomaly on top of another. Most significantly, it creates a disparity in review between an initial decision and a reconsideration of that same decision based on the same criteria. And the government concedes that a person could obtain review if they filed a new -- a new petition and had it denied. But that gives the game away. That is the exact same non-discretionary decision  that the government claims needs to be shielded from review. The only difference is years of  additional delay where families and children live under constant fear that they will be separated.

But I don't know that that's presented in the question presented. You know, the Ninth Circuit said that the Board's decision was not discretionary because it was based on a legal error. Are you asking us to go further and say that this is a non-discretionary decision?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Sotomayor, I think, in context, that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. The Ninth Circuit's decision is based on the fact that the government's finding of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has read it. And I think that's consistent with the way that the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision because the Ninth Circuit's decision is not based on the fact that there was a legal error. It's based on the fact that the government's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor: All right. I'll go to your adversary and ask him. But, counsel, you seem to be asking us to read the statute in a way that's different than the way the Ninth Circuit did. The Ninth Circuit basically said it's a non-discretionary decision because it's based on a legal error, not because the statute itself makes it non-discretionary. But you seem to be saying it's non-discretionary because the statute says it's non-discretionary. Am I right about that?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Sotomayor, I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. I think the government is asking this Court to hold that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor: All right. So you're asking us to go beyond the Ninth Circuit's decision and to say that the statute is non-discretionary, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: I'm asking this Court to affirm the Ninth Circuit's decision on the grounds that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Counsel, that's not what the Ninth Circuit said. It said it was subject to review because it was a legal error. It didn't say it was non-discretionary.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: Justice Sotomayor, I don't think that's right. I think the Ninth Circuit said that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor: All right. Thank you, counsel.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: I think the government is asking this Court to hold that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Thank you.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Kagan.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan: Mr. Deger-Sen, I'm wondering how far you think your argument goes. So let's say that the BIA had said we're not going to review this because the -- the -- the -- the person hasn't exhausted his administrative remedies, or we're not going to review this because the person filed his appeal two days too late, or we're not going to review this because the person didn't pay the right fee. Would you be saying the same thing in those cases?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Kagan, I think, in those cases, the agency would be saying we're not going to review this because of a jurisdictional bar. And I think, in that case, the agency would be exercising its jurisdiction to determine that it didn't have jurisdiction to review the case.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan: Well, I guess what I'm asking is, do you think that Congress would have wanted a court to be able to review that kind of decision?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Kagan, I think, in that circumstance, the court would be able to review the decision, but it would be reviewing the agency's jurisdictional determination. And I think that's consistent with the way this Court reviews jurisdictional determinations in other contexts. I think it's also consistent with the way the government has argued this case in the lower courts. So, in the lower courts, the government has argued that it has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction. And I think that's exactly right.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan: Thank you, Mr. Deger-Sen.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Gorsuch.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: Good morning, counsel. I'd -- I'd like to pick up where Justice Kagan left off. I'm -- I'm struggling to understand how far your argument goes. You said in your brief that if the government's position is adopted, it would effectively immunize the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition from judicial review. Now I -- I -- I -- I understand that argument in the context of fact finding and application of fact to law, but I don't understand how it applies to questions of law, like, for example, whether a particular ground of inadmissibility applies or whether the government has correctly interpreted a provision of the INA. Help me out. Where -- where -- where in the chain does your argument stop?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Gorsuch, I think our argument stops at the point where the agency is making a jurisdictional determination. And I think that's the key point.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: But I -- I -- I thought you said in your brief it would immunize all of it.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: What am I missing?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: -- Justice Gorsuch, I think what we meant in our brief is that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review. And I think that's the key point here. I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: All right. So --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: And I think --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: -- so, if -- if that's the case, I -- I guess I'm still struggling to understand where in the chain it stops. Is it only with respect to a sham marriage finding? Does it go further? I mean, you're -- you're -- you're -- you're -- you're asking us to extend mandamus here, right, and say that there's no review of this kind of decision, right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Gorsuch, we're asking this Court to affirm the Ninth Circuit's decision, which holds that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: All right. So --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: -- so -- so, in -- in -- in -- in the next case, if it's a fact finding, you know, the person didn't actually live in the United States, that's not reviewable?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Gorsuch, I think that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review. I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: All right. So --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: -- so -- so that's -- that's the answer to Justice Kagan's hypotheticals too, right? That's the answer to Justice Sotomayor's question? That's the answer to my question, is that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not reviewable, but everything else is?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Gorsuch, I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: All right. Thank you.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: Thank you.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Kavanaugh.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, counsel.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: Good morning.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: At the beginning of your brief, you say, \"The government's position would effectively immunize the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition from judicial review.\" And then you say, \"The Ninth Circuit correctly rejected that position.\" I'm not sure that's accurate. The Ninth Circuit did not say anything about the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition. It just said, in this particular case, the legal error, the legal question, is reviewable. So I'm not sure the Ninth Circuit said anything about the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition. So I'm wondering if you would just explain that.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: Justice Kavanaugh, I think that's right. I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Well, that's -- that's a lot of circularity, I think, in that answer. I -- I guess what I'm saying is I don't think the Ninth Circuit said anything about the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition. It just said, in this case, there was a legal error, and that's reviewable. And I'm just wondering if you would agree with that.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Kavanaugh, I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Okay. Well, let me ask it this way. Do you agree that the Ninth Circuit did not say anything about the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: Justice Kavanaugh, I think that the Ninth Circuit's decision is based on the fact that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Thank you.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Barrett.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Good morning, counsel. I want to follow up on Justice Kavanaugh's questions. So the Ninth Circuit didn't say anything about the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: Justice Barrett, I think that the Ninth Circuit's decision is based on the fact that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Okay. So the Ninth Circuit didn't say anything about the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition. And you seem to be arguing that the Ninth Circuit did say something about the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition, and I'm wondering why. I mean, you know, we have to decide the question presented, and the question presented is about whether the legal error is reviewable, and that's all the Ninth Circuit decided. So why are you arguing for this broader position that the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition is reviewable?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Barrett, I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Well, I don't understand that answer. I mean, maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong, but the Ninth Circuit didn't say anything about the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition. And I'm just wondering why you keep saying that it did. Because it seems to me that that's not necessary to answer the question presented.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: Justice Barrett, I think the Ninth Circuit's decision is based on the fact that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Okay. Thank you.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Thank you.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Jackson.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: So I guess I'm a little confused about what we're doing here. I had understood that the question presented was about whether the government's legal error in this case was reviewable. And I had understood that the Ninth Circuit said yes. And so I guess I'm trying to understand why we're now talking about whether the entire I-130 adjudication process is reviewable. So can you speak to that?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: Justice Jackson, I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: But the question presented is not about the entire I-130 adjudication process. The question presented is about whether or not the legal error in this case is reviewable. And so I guess I'm trying to understand why we're not focused on that.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Jackson, I think the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision is that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: All right. So let me ask you this. The -- the government says that the Ninth Circuit's decision was based on the legal error. So let's assume that that's the case. Let's assume that the Ninth Circuit's decision was based on the legal error. Would you have a different argument in this case?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: Justice Jackson, I think that the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision is that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: All right. So, fine, I'll go with that. But I guess I'm trying to understand, if the Ninth Circuit's decision was based on the legal error, then why is this case about whether or not the entire I-130 adjudication process is reviewable? I guess I'm trying to understand what the government's argument is. They're saying that the Ninth Circuit's decision was","cleaned":"        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Counsel, you're asking us to go beyond what the Ninth Circuit did and say that this is a non-discretionary decision.

I think the government is asking this Court to hold that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor: All right. So you're asking us to go beyond the Ninth Circuit's decision and to say that the statute is non-discretionary, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: I'm asking this Court to affirm the Ninth Circuit's decision on the grounds that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Counsel, that's not what the Ninth Circuit said. It said it was subject to review because it was a legal error. It didn't say it was non-discretionary.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: Justice Sotomayor, I don't think that's right. I think the Ninth Circuit said that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor: All right. Thank you, counsel.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: I think the government is asking this Court to hold that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Thank you.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Kagan.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan: Mr. Deger-Sen, I'm wondering how far you think your argument goes. So let's say that the BIA had said we're not going to review this because the -- the -- the -- the person hasn't exhausted his administrative remedies, or we're not going to review this because the person filed his appeal two days too late, or we're not going to review this because the person didn't pay the right fee. Would you be saying the same thing in those cases?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Kagan, I think, in those cases, the agency would be saying we're not going to review this because of a jurisdictional bar. And I think, in that case, the agency would be exercising its jurisdiction to determine that it didn't have jurisdiction to review the case.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan: Well, I guess what I'm asking is, do you think that Congress would have wanted a court to be able to review that kind of decision?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Kagan, I think, in that circumstance, the court would be able to review the decision, but it would be reviewing the agency's jurisdictional determination. And I think that's consistent with the way this Court reviews jurisdictional determinations in other contexts. I think it's also consistent with the way the government has argued this case in the lower courts. So, in the lower courts, the government has argued that it has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction. And I think that's exactly right.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan: Thank you, Mr. Deger-Sen.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Gorsuch.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: Good morning, counsel. I'd -- I'd like to pick up where Justice Kagan left off. I'm -- I'm struggling to understand how far your argument goes. You said in your brief that if the government's position is adopted, it would effectively immunize the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition from judicial review. Now I -- I -- I -- I understand that argument in the context of fact finding and application of fact to law, but I don't understand how it applies to questions of law, like, for example, whether a particular ground of inadmissibility applies or whether the government has correctly interpreted a provision of the INA. Help me out. Where -- where -- where in the chain does your argument stop?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Gorsuch, I think our argument stops at the point where the agency is making a jurisdictional determination. And I think that's the key point.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: But I -- I -- I thought you said in your brief it would immunize all of it.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: What am I missing?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: -- Justice Gorsuch, I think what we meant in our brief is that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review. And I think that's the key point here. I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: All right. So --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: And I think --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: -- so, if -- if that's the case, I -- I guess I'm still struggling to understand where in the chain it stops. Is it only with respect to a sham marriage finding? Does it go further? I mean, you're -- you're -- you're -- you're -- you're asking us to extend mandamus here, right, and say that there's no review of this kind of decision, right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Gorsuch, we're asking this Court to affirm the Ninth Circuit's decision, which holds that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: All right. So --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: -- so -- so, in -- in -- in -- in the next case, if it's a fact finding, you know, the person didn't actually live in the United States, that's not reviewable?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Gorsuch, I think that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review. I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: All right. So --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: -- so -- so that's -- that's the answer to Justice Kagan's hypotheticals too, right? That's the answer to Justice Sotomayor's question? That's the answer to my question, is that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not reviewable, but everything else is?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Gorsuch, I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch: All right.

Good morning, counsel.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: Good morning.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: At the beginning of your brief, you say, \"The government's position would effectively immunize the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition from judicial review.\" And then you say, \"The Ninth Circuit correctly rejected that position.\" I'm not sure that's accurate. The Ninth Circuit did not say anything about the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition. It just said, in this particular case, the legal error, the legal question, is reviewable. So I'm not sure the Ninth Circuit said anything about the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition. So I'm wondering if you would just explain that.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: Justice Kavanaugh, I think that's right. I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Well, that's -- that's a lot of circularity, I think, in that answer. I -- I guess what I'm saying is I don't think the Ninth Circuit said anything about the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition. It just said, in this case, there was a legal error, and that's reviewable. And I'm just wondering if you would agree with that.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Kavanaugh, I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.

And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Okay. Well, let me ask it this way. Do you agree that the Ninth Circuit did not say anything about the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: Justice Kavanaugh, I think that the Ninth Circuit's decision is based on the fact that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review. And I think that's consistent with the way the government has argued this case in this Court. And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh: Thank you.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.: Justice Barrett.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Good morning, counsel. I want to follow up on Justice Kavanaugh's questions. So the Ninth Circuit didn't say anything about the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: Justice Barrett, I think that the Ninth Circuit's decision is based on the fact that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review.

And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Okay. So the Ninth Circuit didn't say anything about the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition. And you seem to be arguing that the Ninth Circuit did say something about the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition, and I'm wondering why. I mean, you know, we have to decide the question presented, and the question presented is about whether the legal error is reviewable, and that's all the Ninth Circuit decided. So why are you arguing for this broader position that the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition is reviewable?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Barrett, I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.

And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett: Well, I don't understand that answer. I mean, maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong, but the Ninth Circuit didn't say anything about the entire adjudication of an I-130 petition. And I'm just wondering why you keep saying that it did. Because it seems to me that that's not necessary to answer the question presented.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: Justice Barrett, I think the Ninth Circuit's decision is based on the fact that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review.

I had understood that the question presented was about whether the government's legal error in this case was reviewable. And I had understood that the Ninth Circuit said yes. And so I guess I'm trying to understand why we're now talking about whether the entire I-130 adjudication process is reviewable. So can you speak to that?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: Justice Jackson, I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.

And so I guess I'm trying to understand why we're not focused on that.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: So, Justice Jackson, I think the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision is that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review.

And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: All right. So let me ask you this. The -- the government says that the Ninth Circuit's decision was based on the legal error. So let's assume that that's the case. Let's assume that the Ninth Circuit's decision was based on the legal error. Would you have a different argument in this case?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Samir Deger-Sen: Justice Jackson, I think that the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision is that the agency's determination of a sham marriage is not subject to judicial review.

And I think that's the only way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: All right. So, fine, I'll go with that. But I guess I'm trying to understand, if the Ninth Circuit's decision was based on the legal error, then why is this case about whether or not the entire I-130 adjudication process is reviewable? I guess I'm trying to understand what the government's argument is. They're saying that the Ninth Circuit's decision was","parsed":["Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Counsel, you're asking us to go beyond what the Ninth Circuit did and say that this is a non-discretionary decision.

And so I guess I'm trying to understand why we're now talking about whether the entire I-130 adjudication process is reviewable. So can you speak to that?\"]"}

Roh Sinzdak<\/speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and  may it please the Court:  There were more than 900,000 I-130 visa petitions filed last year, and USCIS granted, denied, or revoked more than 800,000 such petitions. Given this volume, Congress had every reason to streamline judicial review by prohibiting litigation at the revocation  stage. And, to be clear, the government believes that Congress did prohibit litigation by making revocations discretionary, including in the face of a sham-marriage determination. The government does not view a revocation as mandatory in that stage, and I am not aware of a longstanding position of the kind that counsel suggests. The text is very clear on this. Section 1252 bars review of actions, the authority for which is specified to be in the  discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security. And Section 1155 specifies that the  Secretary's authority to revoke visa petitions is discretionary at least three times over, as Justice Alito was noting. It uses the term \"may,\" which connotes discretion. It uses the term \"deems,\" which  fairly exudes discretion. And it uses the capacious term \"good and sufficient cause,\" which calls for a discretionary judgment. Now I -- I don't hear Petitioner today to be advancing the secondary argument that I think we saw in his briefing with respect to the idea that a sham -- at least an underlying sham-marriage determination might be reviewable even if the revocation decision itself is  not because the revocation decision is clearly discretionary under Section 1155, and I think that's for good reason. I don't think that this Court has ever suggested that someone can evade a judicial review bar on review of a decision by breaking that decision into its constituent parts. And, here, the text of Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is very clear because it says that you  --it puts the focus on the nature of the agency's authority.

I think you're saying that it's not a sham-marriage determination that's being challenged. You're saying that it's the revocation of the petition.

Roh Sinzdak:  And I think that's what the statute says because the statute says that you can't challenge a decision, the authority for which is specified to be in the discretion of the Secretary. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, you're begging the question. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E.

Roh Sinzdak:  Well, I think that what they're saying is that the revocation was unlawful. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, that's what you want to say. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that's what the statute says. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But I'm saying  --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  And I think that's what the statute says because the statute says that you can't challenge a decision, the authority for which is specified to be in the discretion of the Secretary. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I'm saying that they're saying that there was no sham marriage. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And so, if there was no sham marriage, there was no reason for the revocation. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that's the question of whether the revocation was unlawful. And I think that if you're challenging the revocation decision, then the statute says that that is specified to be in the discretion of the Secretary. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what would be the standard of review?  If they're challenging the sham marriage, what would be the standard of review? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that the standard of review would be whether the agency acted unreasonably. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So you're saying the standard of review would be abuse of discretion? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  That's correct. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And that's what you think Congress intended? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that that's the standard that Congress intended because it's the standard that Congress specified in Section 1252(a)(2)(D). <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's not the standard that the agency used. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that the agency did use that standard. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  No. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  And I think that the Ninth Circuit, for example, has applied that standard, and it has said that it's very deferential. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, the agency said that it was reviewing it for substantial evidence. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that the  --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And that's what they're saying was wrong. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that the Ninth Circuit has said that substantial evidence review is essentially the same as a reasonableness review. And I think that the Ninth Circuit has said that it's a very deferential standard of review. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, it's not, because you're not challenging the facts. You're challenging the legal basis for the decision. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that the  -- I think that the Ninth Circuit has said that the reasonableness standard is a very deferential standard of review, and I think that the Ninth Circuit has applied that standard in the context of sham marriage determinations. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  And I think that the Ninth Circuit has said that it's very deferential. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Thank you. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Ms. Sinzdak, I'd like to take you back to the colloquy you had with Justice Thomas. And I guess I'm wondering why the government didn't say what you just said, which is that the revocation is the action that's in the Secretary's discretion, and then say that the standard of review that would apply is the same as the standard of review that would apply to any discretionary determination, which is, as you said, whether the agency acted reasonably. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that the government did say that. I think that the government said that the revocation decision is specified to be in the discretion of the Secretary. And I think that the government also said that the standard of review for a discretionary determination is whether the agency acted reasonably. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, you said, \"The agency's discretionary decision to revoke a petition is subject to review for abuse of discretion.\"  And I think that's a little bit different. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that what we were saying there is that it's subject to review for abuse of discretion because it's a discretionary determination. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Right. But I guess what I'm asking is, why didn't you say what you just said, which is that the revocation is the discretionary determination and that that's subject to a reasonableness standard? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think we did say that. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, you said the revocation is discretionary. You said that the revocation is subject to abuse of discretion. But you didn't say that the revocation is the discretionary determination that's subject to abuse of discretion. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that we did say that. I think that what we said is that the revocation is the discretionary determination, and that's why it's subject to abuse of discretion. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Okay. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  And I think that's consistent with the way that the Court has described it in other cases. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Okay. If I could turn to another question, which is, do you have a view as to what the standard of review should be?  I mean, you've been talking about the reasonableness standard, but I'm not sure that that's actually what you want. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that the reasonableness standard is the standard that the Court has said applies to discretionary determinations. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Right. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  And I think that the Ninth Circuit has applied that standard in this context. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, but you're not defending the Ninth Circuit's application of that standard. You're saying that the Ninth Circuit was wrong to do so. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that the Ninth Circuit was wrong to do so because the Ninth Circuit didn't understand the nature of the agency's discretion here. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Right. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  And I think that the Ninth Circuit also didn't understand that the sham marriage determination is merely one factor that the agency may consider in making the discretionary determination. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Right. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that the Ninth Circuit's analysis was wrong, but I think that the Ninth Circuit did apply the correct standard. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  And that standard is reasonableness? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that that's correct. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  And how would you define that standard? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that the Ninth Circuit has said that that standard is very deferential. I think that the Ninth Circuit has said that the -- that the agency's determination is entitled to deference. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  I mean, I guess what I'm asking is, you know, is it, you know, are you just saying that as long as the agency's determination is not, like, off the wall, that that's enough? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that the Ninth Circuit has said that it's a very deferential standard, but I think that it's not a rubber stamp. I think that the Ninth Circuit has said that the agency's determination is entitled to deference, but the court will review it to make sure that it's reasonable. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Thank you. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G.

And so I think you're saying that the revocation of the petition is what's being challenged, and that's what's barred by 1252. Am I right? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  Yes, that's correct, Justice Sotomayor. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So you're saying, if they had a sham marriage, they would be barred from challenging the revocation. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E.

Roh Sinzdak:  And the revocation decision is the agency action that is specified to be in the discretion of the Secretary. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, you're not challenging the revocation. You're saying that there was no sham marriage. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E.

Roh Sinzdak:  And I think that's what the statute says because the statute says that you can't challenge a decision, the authority for which is specified to be in the discretion of the Secretary. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, you're begging the question. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E.

Roh Sinzdak:  So --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And so, if there was no sham marriage, there was no reason for the revocation. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that's the question of whether the revocation was unlawful. And I think that if you're challenging the revocation decision, then the statute says that that is specified to be in the discretion of the Secretary. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what would be the standard of review?  If they're challenging the sham marriage, what would be the standard of review? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that the standard of review would be whether the agency acted unreasonably. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So you're saying the standard of review would be abuse of discretion? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  That's correct. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And that's what you think Congress intended? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that that's the standard that Congress intended because it's the standard that Congress specified in Section 1252(a)(2)(D). <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's not the standard that the agency used. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that the agency did use that standard. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  No. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  And I think that the Ninth Circuit, for example, has applied that standard, and it has said that it's very deferential. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, the agency said that it was reviewing it for substantial evidence. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that the  --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And that's what they're saying was wrong. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that the Ninth Circuit has said that substantial evidence review is essentially the same as a reasonableness review. And I think that the Ninth Circuit has said that it's a very deferential standard of review. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, it's not, because you're not challenging the facts. You're challenging the legal basis for the decision. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that the  -- I think that the Ninth Circuit has said that the reasonableness standard is a very deferential standard of review, and I think that the Ninth Circuit has applied that standard in the context of sham marriage determinations. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  And I think that the Ninth Circuit has said that it's very deferential. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Thank you. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Ms. Sinzdak, I'd like to take you back to the colloquy you had with Justice Thomas. And I guess I'm wondering why the government didn't say what you just said, which is that the revocation is the action that's in the Secretary's discretion, and then say that the standard of review that would apply is the same as the standard of review that would apply to any discretionary determination, which is, as you said, whether the agency acted reasonably. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that the government did say that. I think that the government said that the revocation decision is specified to be in the discretion of the Secretary. And I think that the government also said that the standard of review for a discretionary determination is whether the agency acted reasonably. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, you said, \"The agency's discretionary decision to revoke a petition is subject to review for abuse of discretion.\"  And I think that's a little bit different. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that what we were saying there is that it's subject to review for abuse of discretion because it's a discretionary determination. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Right. But I guess what I'm asking is, why didn't you say what you just said, which is that the revocation is the discretionary determination and that that's subject to a reasonableness standard? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think we did say that. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, you said the revocation is discretionary. You said that the revocation is subject to abuse of discretion. But you didn't say that the revocation is the discretionary determination that's subject to abuse of discretion. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that we did say that. I think that what we said is that the revocation is the discretionary determination, and that's why it's subject to abuse of discretion. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Okay. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  And I think that's consistent with the way that the Court has described it in other cases. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Okay. If I could turn to another question, which is, do you have a view as to what the standard of review should be?  I mean, you've been talking about the reasonableness standard, but I'm not sure that that's actually what you want. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that the reasonableness standard is the standard that the Court has said applies to discretionary determinations. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Right. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  And I think that the Ninth Circuit has applied that standard in this context. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, but you're not defending the Ninth Circuit's application of that standard. You're saying that the Ninth Circuit was wrong to do so. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that the Ninth Circuit was wrong to do so because the Ninth Circuit didn't understand the nature of the agency's discretion here. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Right. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  And I think that the Ninth Circuit also didn't understand that the sham marriage determination is merely one factor that the agency may consider in making the discretionary determination. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Right. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that the Ninth Circuit's analysis was wrong, but I think that the Ninth Circuit did apply the correct standard. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  And that standard is reasonableness? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that that's correct. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  And how would you define that standard? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that the Ninth Circuit has said that that standard is very deferential. I think that the Ninth Circuit has said that the -- that the agency's determination is entitled to deference. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  I mean, I guess what I'm asking is, you know, is it, you know, are you just saying that as long as the agency's determination is not, like, off the wall, that that's enough? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that the Ninth Circuit has said that it's a very deferential standard, but I think that it's not a rubber stamp. I think that the Ninth Circuit has said that the agency's determination is entitled to deference, but the court will review it to make sure that it's reasonable. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Thank you. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I'd like to just follow up on that. Counsel, you're not asking us to overrule the decision below, are you? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  No. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  You're asking us to affirm on different grounds, right? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  That's correct. <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And so you're asking us to affirm on the basis of a reasonableness standard, which is what the Ninth Circuit applied, right? <\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E.

Today, we are talking about the words \"entitled to benefits\" in the DSH adjustment. Just two terms ago, in Empire Health, this Court looked at the words \"entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A\" and said that it means qualifying for the Medicare Part A program. \"Entitled to SSI benefits\" in the same sentence should mean the same thing, qualifying for the SSI program. A person qualifies for the SSI program when she applies and is determined eligible, and that eligibility lasts until it is terminated. The government disagrees because it says that there's no such thing as an SSI program and the only SSI benefit is a monthly cash payment. But Congress created what it called a national program, and it created a program of income insurance. This is a program where a  person who's low income enough to qualify in the first place is promised a minimum guaranteed  income for a calendar year, and in the months where that income is not needed, the cash payment is suspended. Nothing is terminated, and other benefits remain available. In the end, this is about DSH, and DSH is about ensuring that hospitals are reimbursed for low-income patients that are less healthy and that are costlier to treat, and health does not change overnight. The government's interpretation simply does not count that low-income population. It does not count the low -income Medicaid patient coming out of a nursing home. It does not count the low-income patient waiting for her first check. And the list of those it does not count goes on and on.

Today, we are talking about the words \"entitled to benefits\" in the DSH adjustment. Just two terms ago, in Empire Health, this Court looked at the words \"entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A\" and said that it means qualifying for the Medicare Part A program. \"Entitled to SSI benefits\" in the same sentence should mean the same thing, qualifying for the SSI program. A person qualifies for the SSI program when she applies and is determined eligible, and that eligibility lasts until it is terminated. The government disagrees because it says that there's no such thing as an SSI program and the only SSI benefit is a monthly cash payment. But Congress created what it called a national program, and it created a program of income insurance. This is a program where a  person who's low income enough to qualify in the first place is promised a minimum guaranteed  income for a calendar year, and in the months where that income is not needed, the cash payment is suspended. Nothing is terminated, and other benefits remain available. In the end, this is about DSH, and DSH is about ensuring that hospitals are reimbursed for low-income patients that are less healthy and that are costlier to treat, and health does not change overnight. The government's interpretation simply does not count that low-income population. It does not count the low -income Medicaid patient coming out of a nursing home. It does not count the low-income patient waiting for her first check. And the list of those it does not count goes on and on. A DSH proxy that does not measure the low-income population is no proxy at all. I welcome the Court's questions.<\/text>\n\n        ### Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n        A list of questions that Justice Sonia Sotomayor is likely to ask:\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, you said that there's no such thing as an SSI program.

I know that you're arguing that the question of whether a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the evidence for and against a particular factual finding is in equipoise is a legal question. But, as I look at the statute, it appears to me that the equipoise is a factual finding, that it's the agency that's supposed to determine whether the evidence is in equipoise or not. So why should we be giving any deference to the agency's factual determination?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  Well, I think it is a factual determination. The -- the agency has to determine whether the evidence is in equipoise. And I think that's what the court is supposed to be reviewing, but the court is not supposed to be reviewing it for clear error. And I think that the government's argument that it is reviewing it for clear error is -- is not supported by the text of the statute.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, it is reviewing it for clear error, but I think you're saying that the clear error is not whether the evidence is in equipoise but whether a reasonable fact finder could reach that conclusion, correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  Well, I think the -- the -- the -- the question that the court is supposed to be asking is, is there evidence that a reasonable fact finder could find in equipoise?  And if the answer to that is yes, then the benefit of the doubt must be given to the veteran.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So that's the legal question, whether a reasonable fact finder could find it in equipoise?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  I -- I think that's the question that the court is supposed to be asking, yes.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And that's what you're saying the court below did not do?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  Correct. The court below did not ask that question.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Ms. Bostwick, I'd like to take you back to your colloquy with Justice Thomas and just make sure that I understand your position correctly. As I understood Justice Thomas to ask you, he said:  Look, this is what the statute says. It says that the court shall take due account of the rule of prejudicial error. And I think he said:  Isn't that a clear statement that the court should not consider harmless error?  And your answer was:  Well, no, because the Secretary has to say that there was no prejudicial error, and if the Secretary says that there was no prejudicial error, then the court has to take account of that and say, well, there was no prejudicial error. Is that a correct understanding of your position?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  I think that's a fair understanding, although I would say that the -- the statute is really talking about the application of the benefit -of-the-doubt standard. And so, when it says that the court shall take due account of the rule of prejudicial error, it's saying that the court shall take due account of the Secretary's application of the benefit -of-the-doubt standard, which is the rule of prejudicial error.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  So the -- the -- the court has to take due account of the Secretary's application of the rule of prejudicial error, but the court does not have to take account of the fact that there was no prejudicial error?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  No, I think the court does. I think the court has to take account of the fact that there was no prejudicial error. But the -- the -- the question here is whether the court has to defer to the Secretary's determination that there was no prejudicial error, and we don't think it does.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Right. I guess what I'm trying to do is to figure out what the difference is. In other words, the statute says take account of the Secretary's determination, but you say, well, that doesn't mean that the court has to defer to the Secretary's determination. So what does it mean?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  Well, I think it means that the court has to consider the Secretary's determination, but I think the court has to consider it the way it would consider any other legal determination, which is to decide whether it's correct or not.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  So, if the court thinks that the Secretary's determination is wrong, it just says, I don't care what the Secretary says, I think that the Secretary's determination is wrong?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  I think that's right. And -- and I think that's what the statute requires. The statute requires the court to take due account of the rule of prejudicial error, which is the benefit -of-the-doubt standard, and to apply that standard in the first instance.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I'd like to take you back to the colloquy you had with Justice Alito about the clear error rule. You indicated that it would apply in a mixed question of law and fact, a burden -shifting standard, and I -- I guess I want to explore that a little bit further. As I understand it, the clear error rule applies when there's a pure question of fact for an appellate court. But, here, the statute says that the agency shall reduce to writing a -- a specification of the reasons or bases for its decision. So it's not a pure question of fact. It's a mixed question of law and fact, what are the reasons or bases for your decision. And the government says the reason or basis for our decision is we found the evidence in equipoise and, therefore, we gave the benefit of the doubt to the veteran. Now, in a case like that, wouldn't the clear error rule apply?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  I think, if the only question before the court were whether the agency's factual findings were clearly erroneous, then, yes, the clear error standard would apply, but that's not the question before the court.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Well, but isn't that the question before the court?  That's the -- that's the question the government's asking us to take cert on. And it's a question of fact. They say, look, the -- the agency's findings of fact were not clearly erroneous, and, therefore, you should affirm.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  But that -- that's not the question that the -- that the statute directs the court to ask. The statute directs the court to ask whether the agency correctly applied the benefit -of-the-doubt standard, and that is a legal question.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Well, I -- I guess I'm asking you to address the question on which we took cert, which is the clear error rule, and -- and how that applies in a mixed question of law and fact, as I see it, in this case.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  Well, I think, in a -- in a mixed question of law and fact, the clear error standard would apply to the factual components of that standard, but the court would still have to determine whether the agency correctly applied the law to the facts.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  And didn't the agency do that here?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L.

Bostwick:  No, that's not the question on which you took cert. The -- the -- the question on which you took cert was whether the clear error standard is the applicable standard of review, and that's the question that we think the Court should answer.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I -- I understand that. And if we could just take that for the moment, and -- and -- and I -- I'm just trying to understand your answer to me, which is the clear error standard does apply in a mixed question of law and fact. Is that a yes or a no?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  The clear error standard applies to the factual components of a mixed question of law and fact.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  All right. So it does apply in a mixed question of law and fact?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  It applies to the factual components of a mixed question of law and fact, but it does not apply to the legal components of a mixed question of law and fact.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  So it applies but not really?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  No, it applies to the factual components. It does not apply to the legal components.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  All right. So it applies but not really?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  It -- it applies to the factual components, but it does not apply to the legal components.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I got it. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kavanaugh?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M.

Bostwick:  That is correct.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And is that a legal question, the question of whether the agency stated the reasons or bases for its decision?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  That is a legal question, yes.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. And then the clear error standard applies to factual findings, correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  That is correct.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. And then one of the reasons or bases for the decision here was the agency's finding of fact that the evidence was in equipoise, correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  That is correct.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. And then, to play out Justice Gorsuch's hypothetical, if the Court were to say the clear error standard applies to that particular reason or basis for the decision, that finding of fact that the evidence was in equipoise, that would be a legal ruling that the Court would be making, correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  That -- that would be a legal ruling that the Court would be making.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. And then, lastly, to pick up on Justice Gorsuch's question as well, if the Court said that, that would not foreclose the veteran from saying the real problem is that the agency didn't provide adequate reasons or bases for its decision, correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  That -- that's correct.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Barrett?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Ms. Bostwick, can I ask you to assume some things with me?  So assume that the statute does require de novo review, as you argue. Also assume that the agency's application of the statutory standard is a legal question. So, if we assume all of that, why wouldn't the agency's statement of the reasons or bases for its decision, which Justice Kavanaugh was just asking you about, why wouldn't that be legal?  Because it seems to me that if you're asking for a statement of reasons or bases, it's a legal question, did you state reasons or bases, and then, you know, what were the legal -- you know, what was the legal standard that you applied, et cetera, et cetera.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  Well, I think that -- I think that the -- the -- the question of whether the agency stated its reasons or bases is a legal question, but I think that the -- the reasons or bases themselves can be legal or factual. And so, here, the reason or basis that the agency gave for its decision was its factual finding that the evidence was in equipoise. So I think that the -- the -- the question of whether the agency stated its reasons or bases is a legal question, but the reasons or bases themselves can be legal or factual.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  So let me just make sure I understand. You're saying that the legal question is, did the agency state its reasons or bases?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  That's correct.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And then, once the agency states its reasons or bases, we go to the next question, which is, did it apply the correct legal standard in its reasons or bases?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  That's correct.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And is that where the de novo standard kicks in?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  That's correct.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. And then, lastly, just to be clear, you know, the Chief said, you know, the -- the standard of review is the standard of review. You know, the court of appeals isn't saying that the clear error standard applies to legal questions. It's just saying that the clear error standard is the standard of review. So, you know, what -- what is the standard of review?  Is it de novo or is it clear error?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  The -- the -- the standard of review is de novo, and that is the standard of review that is specified in the statute. And I think it's important to note that the -- the government is not arguing that the statute is ambiguous. It's not arguing that the statute actually requires the clear error standard. It's simply saying that the statute doesn't rule out the clear error standard. But, of course, this Court has many times construed statutes that say de novo review, and it has never construed those statutes to permit clear error review. And I think it would be a -- a significant change for the Court to construe this statute to permit clear error review when the statute says de novo review.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Jackson?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  So I guess I'm trying to understand your position with respect to the difference between the legal question of whether the agency applied the correct standard of proof and the factual question of whether the evidence was in equipoise. So, you know, Justice Gorsuch was asking you about the clear error standard, and you indicated that the clear error standard would apply in the situation in which we're trying to figure out whether the evidence was in equipoise. And I guess I don't understand that because I thought that the legal question was whether the evidence was in equipoise. So, if the agency is saying, you know, we have the correct standard of proof, it's the preponderance of the evidence, and we've applied it and we think that the evidence is in equipoise, why isn't that a legal determination that we review de novo?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  Well, I -- I think that the -- the -- the -- the ultimate determination that the evidence is in equipoise is a legal determination. I think that the -- the -- the factual -- the factual findings that the agency makes in order to reach that conclusion are subject to clear error review.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  So","cleaned":"        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I have a very simple question. I know that you're arguing that the question of whether a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the evidence for and against a particular factual finding is in equipoise is a legal question. But, as I look at the statute, it appears to me that the equipoise is a factual finding, that it's the agency that's supposed to determine whether the evidence is in equipoise or not. So why should we be giving any deference to the agency's factual determination?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  Well, I think it is a factual determination. The -- the agency has to determine whether the evidence is in equipoise. And I think that's what the court is supposed to be reviewing, but the court is not supposed to be reviewing it for clear error. And I think that the government's argument that it is reviewing it for clear error is -- is not supported by the text of the statute.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, it is reviewing it for clear error, but I think you're saying that the clear error is not whether the evidence is in equipoise but whether a reasonable fact finder could reach that conclusion, correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  Well, I think the -- the -- the -- the question that the court is supposed to be asking is, is there evidence that a reasonable fact finder could find in equipoise?  And if the answer to that is yes, then the benefit of the doubt must be given to the veteran.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So that's the legal question, whether a reasonable fact finder could find it in equipoise?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  I -- I think that's the question that the court is supposed to be asking, yes.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And that's what you're saying the court below did not do?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  Correct. The court below did not ask that question.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Ms. Bostwick, I'd like to take you back to your colloquy with Justice Thomas and just make sure that I understand your position correctly. As I understood Justice Thomas to ask you, he said:  Look, this is what the statute says. It says that the court shall take due account of the rule of prejudicial error. And I think he said:  Isn't that a clear statement that the court should not consider harmless error?  And your answer was:  Well, no, because the Secretary has to say that there was no prejudicial error, and if the Secretary says that there was no prejudicial error, then the court has to take account of that and say, well, there was no prejudicial error. Is that a correct understanding of your position?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  I think that's a fair understanding, although I would say that the -- the statute is really talking about the application of the benefit -of-the-doubt standard. And so, when it says that the court shall take due account of the rule of prejudicial error, it's saying that the court shall take due account of the Secretary's application of the benefit -of-the-doubt standard, which is the rule of prejudicial error.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  So the -- the -- the court has to take due account of the Secretary's application of the rule of prejudicial error, but the court does not have to take account of the fact that there was no prejudicial error?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  No, I think the court does. I think the court has to take account of the fact that there was no prejudicial error. But the -- the -- the question here is whether the court has to defer to the Secretary's determination that there was no prejudicial error, and we don't think it does.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Right. I guess what I'm trying to do is to figure out what the difference is. In other words, the statute says take account of the Secretary's determination, but you say, well, that doesn't mean that the court has to defer to the Secretary's determination. So what does it mean?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  Well, I think it means that the court has to consider the Secretary's determination, but I think the court has to consider it the way it would consider any other legal determination, which is to decide whether it's correct or not.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  So, if the court thinks that the Secretary's determination is wrong, it just says, I don't care what the Secretary says, I think that the Secretary's determination is wrong?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  I think that's right. And -- and I think that's what the statute requires. The statute requires the court to take due account of the rule of prejudicial error, which is the benefit -of-the-doubt standard, and to apply that standard in the first instance.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I'd like to take you back to the colloquy you had with Justice Alito about the clear error rule. You indicated that it would apply in a mixed question of law and fact, a burden -shifting standard, and I -- I guess I want to explore that a little bit further. As I understand it, the clear error rule applies when there's a pure question of fact for an appellate court. But, here, the statute says that the agency shall reduce to writing a -- a specification of the reasons or bases for its decision. So it's not a pure question of fact. It's a mixed question of law and fact, what are the reasons or bases for your decision. And the government says the reason or basis for our decision is we found the evidence in equipoise and, therefore, we gave the benefit of the doubt to the veteran. Now, in a case like that, wouldn't the clear error rule apply?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  I think, if the only question before the court were whether the agency's factual findings were clearly erroneous, then, yes, the clear error standard would apply, but that's not the question before the court.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Well, but isn't that the question before the court?  That's the -- that's the question the government's asking us to take cert on. And it's a question of fact. They say, look, the -- the agency's findings of fact were not clearly erroneous, and, therefore, you should affirm.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  But that -- that's not the question that the -- that the statute directs the court to ask. The statute directs the court to ask whether the agency correctly applied the benefit -of-the-doubt standard, and that is a legal question.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Well, I -- I guess I'm asking you to address the question on which we took cert, which is the clear error rule, and -- and how that applies in a mixed question of law and fact, as I see it, in this case.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  Well, I think, in a -- in a mixed question of law and fact, the clear error standard would apply to the factual components of that standard, but the court would still have to determine whether the agency correctly applied the law to the facts.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  And didn't the agency do that here?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  I don't think the agency did that here because I don't think the agency did a -- a sufficient job of explaining its reasons or bases for its decision.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  And that's the question on which we took cert?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  No, that's not the question on which you took cert. The -- the -- the question on which you took cert was whether the clear error standard is the applicable standard of review, and that's the question that we think the Court should answer.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I -- I understand that. And if we could just take that for the moment, and -- and -- and I -- I'm just trying to understand your answer to me, which is the clear error standard does apply in a mixed question of law and fact. Is that a yes or a no?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  The clear error standard applies to the factual components of a mixed question of law and fact.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  All right. So it does apply in a mixed question of law and fact?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  It applies to the factual components of a mixed question of law and fact, but it does not apply to the legal components of a mixed question of law and fact.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  So it applies but not really?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L. Bostwick:  No, it applies to the factual components. It does not apply to the legal components.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  All right. So it applies but not really?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L.

Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kavanaugh?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M.

It's simply saying that the statute doesn't rule out the clear error standard. But, of course, this Court has many times construed statutes that say de novo review, and it has never construed those statutes to permit clear error review.

So, you know, Justice Gorsuch was asking you about the clear error standard, and you indicated that the clear error standard would apply in the situation in which we're trying to figure out whether the evidence was in equipoise. And I guess I don't understand that because I thought that the legal question was whether the evidence was in equipoise. So, if the agency is saying, you know, we have the correct standard of proof, it's the preponderance of the evidence, and we've applied it and we think that the evidence is in equipoise, why isn't that a legal determination that we review de novo?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Melanie L.

I know that you're arguing that the question of whether a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the evidence for and against a particular factual finding is in equipoise is a legal question. But, as I look at the statute, it appears to me that the equipoise is a factual finding, that it's the agency that's supposed to determine whether the evidence is in equipoise or not. So why should we be giving any deference to the agency's factual determination?<\/text>","Melanie L. Bostwick:  Well, I think it is a factual determination. The -- the agency has to determine whether the evidence is in equipoise.

Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan?<\/text>","Justice Elena Kagan:  Ms. Bostwick, I'd like to take you back to your colloquy with Justice Thomas and just make sure that I understand your position correctly. As I understood Justice Thomas to ask you, he said:  Look, this is what the statute says. It says that the court shall take due account of the rule of prejudicial error. And I think he said:  Isn't that a clear statement that the court should not consider harmless error?  And your answer was:  Well, no, because the Secretary has to say that there was no prejudicial error, and if the Secretary says that there was no prejudicial error, then the court has to take account of that and say, well, there was no prejudicial error. Is that a correct understanding of your position?<\/text>","Melanie L. Bostwick:  I think that's a fair understanding, although I would say that the -- the statute is really talking about the application of the benefit -of-the-doubt standard. And so, when it says that the court shall take due account of the rule of prejudicial error, it's saying that the court shall take due account of the Secretary's application of the benefit -of-the-doubt standard, which is the rule of prejudicial error.<\/text>","Justice Elena Kagan:  So the -- the -- the court has to take due account of the Secretary's application of the rule of prejudicial error, but the court does not have to take account of the fact that there was no prejudicial error?<\/text>","Melanie L. Bostwick:  No, I think the court does. I think the court has to take account of the fact that there was no prejudicial error. But the -- the -- the question here is whether the court has to defer to the Secretary's determination that there was no prejudicial error, and we don't think it does.<\/text>","Justice Elena Kagan:  Right. I guess what I'm trying to do is to figure out what the difference is. In other words, the statute says take account of the Secretary's determination, but you say, well, that doesn't mean that the court has to defer to the Secretary's determination. So what does it mean?<\/text>","Melanie L. Bostwick:  Well, I think it means that the court has to consider the Secretary's determination, but I think the court has to consider it the way it would consider any other legal determination, which is to decide whether it's correct or not.<\/text>","Justice Elena Kagan:  So, if the court thinks that the Secretary's determination is wrong, it just says, I don't care what the Secretary says, I think that the Secretary's determination is wrong?<\/text>","Melanie L.

As I understand it, the clear error rule applies when there's a pure question of fact for an appellate court. But, here, the statute says that the agency shall reduce to writing a -- a specification of the reasons or bases for its decision. So it's not a pure question of fact. It's a mixed question of law and fact, what are the reasons or bases for your decision. And the government says the reason or basis for our decision is we found the evidence in equipoise and, therefore, we gave the benefit of the doubt to the veteran. Now, in a case like that, wouldn't the clear error rule apply?<\/text>","Melanie L.

Bostwick:  But that -- that's not the question that the -- that the statute directs the court to ask. The statute directs the court to ask whether the agency correctly applied the benefit -of-the-doubt standard, and that is a legal question.<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  It -- it applies to the factual components, but it does not apply to the legal components.<\/text>\", \"Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. And then one of the reasons or bases for the decision here was the agency's finding of fact that the evidence was in equipoise, correct?<\/text>\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Thank you.<\/text>\", \"Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan?<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  Well, I think the -- the -- the -- the question that the court is supposed to be asking is, is there evidence that a reasonable fact finder could find in equipoise?  And if the answer to that is yes, then the benefit of the doubt must be given to the veteran.<\/text>\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I'd like to take you back to the colloquy you had with Justice Alito about the clear error rule. You indicated that it would apply in a mixed question of law and fact, a burden -shifting standard, and I -- I guess I want to explore that a little bit further. As I understand it, the clear error rule applies when there's a pure question of fact for an appellate court. But, here, the statute says that the agency shall reduce to writing a -- a specification of the reasons or bases for its decision. So it's not a pure question of fact. It's a mixed question of law and fact, what are the reasons or bases for your decision. And the government says the reason or basis for our decision is we found the evidence in equipoise and, therefore, we gave the benefit of the doubt to the veteran. Now, in a case like that, wouldn't the clear error rule apply?<\/text>\", \"Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Barrett?<\/text>\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Thank you.<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  Well, I think that -- I think that the -- the -- the question of whether the agency stated its reasons or bases is a legal question, but I think that the -- the reasons or bases themselves can be legal or factual. And so, here, the reason or basis that the agency gave for its decision was its factual finding that the evidence was in equipoise. So I think that the -- the -- the question of whether the agency stated its reasons or bases is a legal question, but the reasons or bases themselves can be legal or factual.<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  No, it applies to the factual components. It does not apply to the legal components.<\/text>\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And is that where the de novo standard kicks in?<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  The -- the -- the standard of review is de novo, and that is the standard of review that is specified in the statute. And I think it's important to note that the -- the government is not arguing that the statute is ambiguous. It's not arguing that the statute actually requires the clear error standard. It's simply saying that the statute doesn't rule out the clear error standard. But, of course, this Court has many times construed statutes that say de novo review, and it has never construed those statutes to permit clear error review. And I think it would be a -- a significant change for the Court to construe this statute to permit clear error review when the statute says de novo review.<\/text>\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Ms. Bostwick, can I ask you to assume some things with me?  So assume that the statute does require de novo review, as you argue. Also assume that the agency's application of the statutory standard is a legal question. So, if we assume all of that, why wouldn't the agency's statement of the reasons or bases for its decision, which Justice Kavanaugh was just asking you about, why wouldn't that be legal?  Because it seems to me that if you're asking for a statement of reasons or bases, it's a legal question, did you state reasons or bases, and then, you know, what were the legal -- you know, what was the legal standard that you applied, et cetera, et cetera.<\/text>\", \"Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  So I guess I'm trying to understand your position with respect to the difference between the legal question of whether the agency applied the correct standard of proof and the factual question of whether the evidence was in equipoise. So, you know, Justice Gorsuch was asking you about the clear error standard, and you indicated that the clear error standard would apply in the situation in which we're trying to figure out whether the evidence was in equipoise. And I guess I don't understand that because I thought that the legal question was whether the evidence was in equipoise. So, if the agency is saying, you know, we have the correct standard of proof, it's the preponderance of the evidence, and we've applied it and we think that the evidence is in equipoise, why isn't that a legal determination that we review de novo?<\/text>\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Well, but isn't that the question before the court?  That's the -- that's the question the government's asking us to take cert on. And it's a question of fact. They say, look, the -- the agency's findings of fact were not clearly erroneous, and, therefore, you should affirm.<\/text>\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  And didn't the agency do that here?<\/text>\", \"Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Just to follow up on Justice Gorsuch's questions, the statute requires the agency to state the reasons or bases for its decision, correct?<\/text>\", \"Justice Elena Kagan:  So the -- the -- the court has to take due account of the Secretary's application of the rule of prejudicial error, but the court does not have to take account of the fact that there was no prejudicial error?<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  I think that's a fair understanding, although I would say that the -- the statute is really talking about the application of the benefit -of-the-doubt standard. And so, when it says that the court shall take due account of the rule of prejudicial error, it's saying that the court shall take due account of the Secretary's application of the benefit -of-the-doubt standard, which is the rule of prejudicial error.<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  Well, I think, in a -- in a mixed question of law and fact, the clear error standard would apply to the factual components of that standard, but the court would still have to determine whether the agency correctly applied the law to the facts.<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  It applies to the factual components of a mixed question of law and fact, but it does not apply to the legal components of a mixed question of law and fact.<\/text>\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  All right. So it applies but not really?<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  Well, I think it is a factual determination. The -- the agency has to determine whether the evidence is in equipoise. And I think that's what the court is supposed to be reviewing, but the court is not supposed to be reviewing it for clear error. And I think that the government's argument that it is reviewing it for clear error is -- is not supported by the text of the statute.<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  The clear error standard applies to the factual components of a mixed question of law and fact.<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  That's correct.<\/text>\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I got it. Thank you.<\/text>\", \"Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch?<\/text>\", \"Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Jackson?<\/text>\", \"Justice Elena Kagan:  So, if the court thinks that the Secretary's determination is wrong, it just says, I don't care what the Secretary says, I think that the Secretary's determination is wrong?<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  I think, if the only question before the court were whether the agency's factual findings were clearly erroneous, then, yes, the clear error standard would apply, but that's not the question before the court.<\/text>\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And that's what you're saying the court below did not do?<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  That is a legal question, yes.<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  Correct. The court below did not ask that question.<\/text>\", \"Justice Elena Kagan:  Ms. Bostwick, I'd like to take you back to your colloquy with Justice Thomas and just make sure that I understand your position correctly. As I understood Justice Thomas to ask you, he said:  Look, this is what the statute says. It says that the court shall take due account of the rule of prejudicial error. And I think he said:  Isn't that a clear statement that the court should not consider harmless error?  And your answer was:  Well, no, because the Secretary has to say that there was no prejudicial error, and if the Secretary says that there was no prejudicial error, then the court has to take account of that and say, well, there was no prejudicial error. Is that a correct understanding of your position?<\/text>\", \"Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kavanaugh?<\/text>\", \"Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. Thank you.<\/text>\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, it is reviewing it for clear error, but I think you're saying that the clear error is not whether the evidence is in equipoise but whether a reasonable fact finder could reach that conclusion, correct?<\/text>\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  All right. So it does apply in a mixed question of law and fact?<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  That -- that's correct.<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  I -- I think that's the question that the court is supposed to be asking, yes.<\/text>\", \"Justice Elena Kagan:  Thank you.<\/text>\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  So let me just make sure I understand. You're saying that the legal question is, did the agency state its reasons or bases?<\/text>\", \"Justice Elena Kagan:  Right. I guess what I'm trying to do is to figure out what the difference is. In other words, the statute says take account of the Secretary's determination, but you say, well, that doesn't mean that the court has to defer to the Secretary's determination. So what does it mean?<\/text>\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  And then, once the agency states its reasons or bases, we go to the next question, which is, did it apply the correct legal standard in its reasons or bases?<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  Well, I -- I think that the -- the -- the -- the ultimate determination that the evidence is in equipoise is a legal determination. I think that the -- the -- the factual -- the factual findings that the agency makes in order to reach that conclusion are subject to clear error review.<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  I think that's right. And -- and I think that's what the statute requires. The statute requires the court to take due account of the rule of prejudicial error, which is the benefit -of-the-doubt standard, and to apply that standard in the first instance.<\/text>\", \"Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. And then the clear error standard applies to factual findings, correct?<\/text>\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So that's the legal question, whether a reasonable fact finder could find it in equipoise?<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  No, that's not the question on which you took cert. The -- the -- the question on which you took cert was whether the clear error standard is the applicable standard of review, and that's the question that we think the Court should answer.<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  No, I think the court does. I think the court has to take account of the fact that there was no prejudicial error. But the -- the -- the question here is whether the court has to defer to the Secretary's determination that there was no prejudicial error, and we don't think it does.<\/text>\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I have a very simple question. I know that you're arguing that the question of whether a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the evidence for and against a particular factual finding is in equipoise is a legal question. But, as I look at the statute, it appears to me that the equipoise is a factual finding, that it's the agency that's supposed to determine whether the evidence is in equipoise or not. So why should we be giving any deference to the agency's factual determination?<\/text>\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  So it applies but not really?<\/text>\", \"Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. And then, to play out Justice Gorsuch's hypothetical, if the Court were to say the clear error standard applies to that particular reason or basis for the decision, that finding of fact that the evidence was in equipoise, that would be a legal ruling that the Court would be making, correct?<\/text>\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I -- I understand that. And if we could just take that for the moment, and -- and -- and I -- I'm just trying to understand your answer to me, which is the clear error standard does apply in a mixed question of law and fact. Is that a yes or a no?<\/text>\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett:  Okay. And then, lastly, just to be clear, you know, the Chief said, you know, the -- the standard of review is the standard of review. You know, the court of appeals isn't saying that the clear error standard applies to legal questions. It's just saying that the clear error standard is the standard of review. So, you know, what -- what is the standard of review?  Is it de novo or is it clear error?<\/text>\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  And that's the question on which we took cert?<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  That -- that would be a legal ruling that the Court would be making.<\/text>\", \"Melanie L. Bostwick:  That is correct.<\/text>\", \"Melanie L.

But, in the regulations, they talk about the evidence in the record is in equipoise. And I think that that's what you're saying, that the equipoise is what the agency has to find. But, in the regulations, they say that the equipoise has to be between the evidence that supports the claim and the evidence that does not support the claim. So, if you have a claimant who has a doctor who says, I have a disability, and you have a doctor who says, I don't, and you have a doctor who says, I don't know, then you're in equipoise, correct?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think, as a matter of logic, that's right, yes.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. But, if you have a claimant who has a doctor who says, I have a disability, and you have two doctors who say, I don't, then the equipoise is broken, correct?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Yes.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Now, in this case, the agency said, I don't know, and then they said, well, we're going to assume that the doctor who said I don't know is really saying I don't. And then they say, well, now the equipoise is broken. But they never said, we don't believe the doctor who said I do. They just said, we're going to assume that the doctor who said I don't know is really saying I don't. So, in that situation, the equipoise is still maintained, correct?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So, Justice Sotomayor, I think you're right that the equipoise is still maintained, but I think the premise of your question is that the I don't know evidence is itself evidence that cuts against the veteran, and that's not how I understand it. I understand it to be neutral. It's neither evidence that supports the veteran's claim nor evidence that cuts against it. And so, if you have a world where you have one doctor who says you have it, one doctor who says you don't have it, and one doctor who says I don't know, I think that's an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, then you're not reading the regulation, because the regulation is very clear that it has to be between the evidence that supports the claim and the evidence that does not support the claim. So I don't know how you can read the I don't know doctor as not being evidence that does not support the claim. It doesn't support the claim, so it has to be evidence that does not support the claim.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Well, I -- I think the -- the regulation, as I read it, is consistent with the statute, which is to say, as I read it, it says the evidence in the record is in equipoise when the evidence that supports the claim is in approximate balance with the evidence that does not support the claim. And I think the evidence that does not support the claim is evidence that cuts against the claim. It's not evidence that's neutral. And I think that's consistent with the way the Secretary has long understood the benefit of the doubt standard, which is that the evidence that cuts against the veteran is evidence that's adverse to the veteran's claim.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if the doctor says, I don't know, you're saying that that's not evidence that cuts against the veteran?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's right. I think, if the doctor says, I don't know, it doesn't cut against the veteran. It's neutral. It's neither evidence that supports the claim nor evidence that cuts against the claim.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if you have one doctor who says, I have a disability, and you have one doctor who says, I don't know, you win, the veteran wins?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Yes, because the -- the -- the evidence that supports the claim is in approximate balance with the evidence that cuts against the claim, which, in that scenario, is zero.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And, here, you had one doctor who said, I don't know, and you had one doctor who said, I don't. And you said, I'm going to assume the doctor who said I don't know is really saying I don't, and, therefore, the equipoise is broken. But you didn't say that the doctor who said I have a disability is not believable. You didn't say anything about that. You just made the assumption that the I don't know doctor is an I don't doctor. So, under that theory, why is the equipoise broken?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Because the I don't know doctor, in this case, was the agency's doctor, and the agency's doctor, when he said, I don't know, also said, I'm going to go consult the literature, and then he came back and said, I've consulted the literature, and now I think it's less likely than not that you have this condition. And so, at that point, you know, he had gone from I don't know to it's less likely than not. And, at that point, it's not in equipoise. It's tipped against the veteran.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you're not -- you're not -- you're not accepting that the I don't know is a neutral factor. You're saying it's a negative factor.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  No, I'm not saying it's a negative factor. I'm saying, in this case, the I don't know factor became a negative factor when the doctor went back and did the research and said, now I have an opinion, and it's that it's less likely than not.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go to the legal issue.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Mm-hmm.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm sorry, I'm going to cut you a little bit short. I'm sorry.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's okay.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you'll be able to answer the legal issue.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  The -- the -- the -- the veteran court said that the agency didn't have to provide a medical opinion. And the agency said, we didn't have to provide a medical opinion because we didn't think the veteran was credible. And so, under Lane, why isn't that a legal issue?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So, in Lane, the agency had a regulation that said we need to provide a medical opinion if we think you have a particular condition, and the agency didn't do that. And this Court said, well, that was a legal error, it was harmful, and, therefore, you get another shot at it. And so I think, if you have a situation like that where there's a legal error, that is, the agency didn't follow its own regulations, its own procedural rules, then that's a legal error. But, here, the agency did follow its own regulations. It followed the relevant regulation, 3.159(c)(4), which says that you need to provide an opinion only when you have evidence of an in-service event, which the agency found there wasn't here.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what you're saying is that the agency was not required to state its reasons for not providing a medical opinion?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Well, it did state its reasons, which is, if you look at page 12 of the Joint Appendix, the agency said, we're not going to provide a medical opinion because we don't think there was an in-service injury, event, disease, or -- or injury.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But it didn't say, we don't think you're credible.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's right. It didn't say that. And it didn't have to say that.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So you're saying it has no obligation to say why it's not finding something?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Well, I think, under this Court's decision in Sims, it doesn't have to say why it finds something or doesn't find something, but it does have to provide a statement of reasons or bases, and it did that here. It said, we're not providing a medical opinion because we don't think there was an in-service injury, period.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Mr. Joshi, could you say more about the -- the -- the -- the -- the difference between your view and the SG's view?  I mean, you're both saying that there's no de novo review here, but you seem to be proposing a kind of more deferential standard of review than the SG is.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So I think, if you read our brief, you might think that, but I don't think that's actually the difference between the two of us. I think we're actually on the same page here. I think the only difference between the two of us is that the SG has, I think, a slightly different view of the clear error standard, and it thinks that that standard is more lenient than we do. And so the SG thinks that the clear error standard is a standard that is, you know, maybe even a little bit more deferential than the one that this Court applies in the -- in the -- in the Social Security context. We don't read this Court's Social Security cases that way. We think that they're actually applying the same standard that we think should apply here, which is the one that this Court has traditionally applied in the clear error context, which is, if you could not rule out the possibility of an error, then the Court of Appeals should not find clear error. And so we think that that's the same standard that this Court applies in the Social Security context. It's the same standard that this Court has traditionally applied in the clear error context. And that's the standard that should apply here. So I think that's actually the only difference between us.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  And if I could just go back to the Chief Justice's question about the statute, you said, well, the statute is silent as to the standard of review. But the statute does say that the Court shall take due account of the Secretary's -- the -- the -- the Board's -- the Board's application of 5107(b) in making its determination under 7104(a). And I guess what I want to ask you is, what does that mean?  What does it mean to take due account of the Board's application of 5107(b)?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So I think the most natural way to read that is that you have to review it for clear error. I think, if you review it de novo, you're not taking account of the Board's application of 5107(b). You're essentially disregarding it. And so I think the most natural reading of that language is that it's telling the Veterans Court, when you review the Board's application of 5107(b), you have to do so under a deferential standard of review. And, again, I think that that is entirely consistent with the way this Court has always understood judicial review of agency fact-finding to work.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I'd like to pick up where Justice Kagan left off. I -- I -- I'd like to understand what you think the difference between your position and the SG's is. I -- I -- I had understood it to be that you thought that the Board's statement of reasons was adequate, that the Board had adequately explained itself, and that the Federal Circuit was wrong to find that it had not, and -- and that that was the basis of your -- your -- your -- your -- your -- your position. Is -- is that right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That is not right, Justice Gorsuch.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  We think that the Board did not adequately explain itself. And the only question in this case is whether the Board's failure to adequately explain itself was harmless. And we think that it was harmless because the Board's explanation, although inadequate, was not prejudicial to the veteran. And we think that's the only question in this case.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And -- and -- and -- and so, if the Board had done a better job of explaining itself, we wouldn't be here?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And then, with respect to the -- the equipoise question, I guess I'm -- I'm struggling to understand where in the statute that comes from. I -- I -- I -- I -- I take your point that the -- that the regulation does speak about equipoise, but where -- where do you get that from the statute?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So, Justice Gorsuch, I think you get it from the statute in the following sense:  The statute tells you that if the evidence is in equipoise, you resolve the tie in favor of the veteran. And I think that that means that if the evidence is not in equipoise, you don't resolve the tie in favor of the veteran. And so I think that's where it comes from. It's not stated in -- in haec verba, but I think that's the only plausible understanding of the statutory language.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  So you're saying that the equipoise language is just another way of saying a preponderance of the evidence standard?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  No, I don't think that at all. I think that the equipoise language is just a way of saying, if the evidence is in equipoise, you resolve the tie in favor of the veteran. If the evidence is not in equipoise, you don't resolve the tie in favor of the veteran. I don't think it's a -- a -- a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. I think it's a tie goes to the runner standard.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  But, if I might, just to interrupt, that sounds like a preponderance standard to me, that -- that -- that if it's equipoise, you give the benefit of the doubt to the veteran, but, if it's not equipoise, then you don't. And that sounds like a preponderance standard.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I don't think so, Justice Gorsuch, because, under a preponderance standard, 51 percent is enough to win. Under this standard, 51 percent is not enough to win. You need a tie to win. And I think that's the fundamental difference between the two standards.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  So what's the difference between the two standards?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  The difference between the two standards is that, under a preponderance standard, 51 percent is enough to win. Under this standard, 51 percent is not enough to win. You need a tie.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I -- I got that part. But, if -- if you're going to say that 51 percent is enough to win, what are you saying the other 49 percent is?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So, if you have 51 percent, that means that you have evidence that cuts against the veteran's claim and evidence that supports the veteran's claim, and they're not in equipoise. And so, under the statute, you don't resolve that tie in favor of the veteran. You say, I'm sorry, 51 percent is not enough to win.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  But -- but I guess I'm just not seeing the difference, other than just semantically, that 51 percent is enough to win, and, here, 51 percent is not enough to win.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Right. I -- I -- I think the difference is that, in one case, you have evidence that cuts against the veteran's claim, and in the other case, you don't have evidence that cuts against the veteran's claim. And so I think that's the difference.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Well, I think that's slicing the baloney a little thin for me, but I'll let it go. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Fair enough.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kavanaugh?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  I have several questions, but I'll try to be brief. First, on the clear error standard, I just want to make sure I understand correctly. You agree, I think, that the Board's statement of reasons must enable a review court to conclude the Board considered each relevant fact. Is that accurate?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That","cleaned":"        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Mr. Joshi, I don't know what's more cryptic, the language of this statute or the regulations. But, in the regulations, they talk about the evidence in the record is in equipoise. And I think that that's what you're saying, that the equipoise is what the agency has to find. But, in the regulations, they say that the equipoise has to be between the evidence that supports the claim and the evidence that does not support the claim. So, if you have a claimant who has a doctor who says, I have a disability, and you have a doctor who says, I don't, and you have a doctor who says, I don't know, then you're in equipoise, correct?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think, as a matter of logic, that's right, yes.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. But, if you have a claimant who has a doctor who says, I have a disability, and you have two doctors who say, I don't, then the equipoise is broken, correct?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Yes.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Now, in this case, the agency said, I don't know, and then they said, well, we're going to assume that the doctor who said I don't know is really saying I don't. And then they say, well, now the equipoise is broken. But they never said, we don't believe the doctor who said I do. They just said, we're going to assume that the doctor who said I don't know is really saying I don't. So, in that situation, the equipoise is still maintained, correct?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So, Justice Sotomayor, I think you're right that the equipoise is still maintained, but I think the premise of your question is that the I don't know evidence is itself evidence that cuts against the veteran, and that's not how I understand it. I understand it to be neutral. It's neither evidence that supports the veteran's claim nor evidence that cuts against it. And so, if you have a world where you have one doctor who says you have it, one doctor who says you don't have it, and one doctor who says I don't know, I think that's an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, then you're not reading the regulation, because the regulation is very clear that it has to be between the evidence that supports the claim and the evidence that does not support the claim. So I don't know how you can read the I don't know doctor as not being evidence that does not support the claim. It doesn't support the claim, so it has to be evidence that does not support the claim.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Well, I -- I think the -- the regulation, as I read it, is consistent with the statute, which is to say, as I read it, it says the evidence in the record is in equipoise when the evidence that supports the claim is in approximate balance with the evidence that does not support the claim. And I think the evidence that does not support the claim is evidence that cuts against the claim. It's not evidence that's neutral. And I think that's consistent with the way the Secretary has long understood the benefit of the doubt standard, which is that the evidence that cuts against the veteran is evidence that's adverse to the veteran's claim.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if the doctor says, I don't know, you're saying that that's not evidence that cuts against the veteran?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's right. I think, if the doctor says, I don't know, it doesn't cut against the veteran. It's neutral. It's neither evidence that supports the claim nor evidence that cuts against the claim.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if you have one doctor who says, I have a disability, and you have one doctor who says, I don't know, you win, the veteran wins?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Yes, because the -- the -- the evidence that supports the claim is in approximate balance with the evidence that cuts against the claim, which, in that scenario, is zero.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And, here, you had one doctor who said, I don't know, and you had one doctor who said, I don't. And you said, I'm going to assume the doctor who said I don't know is really saying I don't, and, therefore, the equipoise is broken. But you didn't say that the doctor who said I have a disability is not believable. You didn't say anything about that. You just made the assumption that the I don't know doctor is an I don't doctor. So, under that theory, why is the equipoise broken?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Because the I don't know doctor, in this case, was the agency's doctor, and the agency's doctor, when he said, I don't know, also said, I'm going to go consult the literature, and then he came back and said, I've consulted the literature, and now I think it's less likely than not that you have this condition. And so, at that point, you know, he had gone from I don't know to it's less likely than not. And, at that point, it's not in equipoise. It's tipped against the veteran.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you're not -- you're not -- you're not accepting that the I don't know is a neutral factor. You're saying it's a negative factor.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  No, I'm not saying it's a negative factor. I'm saying, in this case, the I don't know factor became a negative factor when the doctor went back and did the research and said, now I have an opinion, and it's that it's less likely than not.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go to the legal issue.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Mm-hmm.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm sorry, I'm going to cut you a little bit short. I'm sorry.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's okay.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you'll be able to answer the legal issue.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  The -- the -- the -- the veteran court said that the agency didn't have to provide a medical opinion. And the agency said, we didn't have to provide a medical opinion because we didn't think the veteran was credible. And so, under Lane, why isn't that a legal issue?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So, in Lane, the agency had a regulation that said we need to provide a medical opinion if we think you have a particular condition, and the agency didn't do that. And this Court said, well, that was a legal error, it was harmful, and, therefore, you get another shot at it. And so I think, if you have a situation like that where there's a legal error, that is, the agency didn't follow its own regulations, its own procedural rules, then that's a legal error. But, here, the agency did follow its own regulations. It followed the relevant regulation, 3.159(c)(4), which says that you need to provide an opinion only when you have evidence of an in-service event, which the agency found there wasn't here.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what you're saying is that the agency was not required to state its reasons for not providing a medical opinion?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Well, it did state its reasons, which is, if you look at page 12 of the Joint Appendix, the agency said, we're not going to provide a medical opinion because we don't think there was an in-service injury, event, disease, or -- or injury.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But it didn't say, we don't think you're credible.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's right. It didn't say that. And it didn't have to say that.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So you're saying it has no obligation to say why it's not finding something?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Well, I think, under this Court's decision in Sims, it doesn't have to say why it finds something or doesn't find something, but it does have to provide a statement of reasons or bases, and it did that here. It said, we're not providing a medical opinion because we don't think there was an in-service injury, period.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Mr. Joshi, could you say more about the -- the -- the -- the -- the difference between your view and the SG's view?  I mean, you're both saying that there's no de novo review here, but you seem to be proposing a kind of more deferential standard of review than the SG is.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So I think, if you read our brief, you might think that, but I don't think that's actually the difference between the two of us.

Kavanaugh:  I have several questions, but I'll try to be brief. First, on the clear error standard, I just want to make sure I understand correctly. You agree, I think, that the Board's statement of reasons must enable a review court to conclude the Board considered each relevant fact. Is that accurate?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That","parsed":["Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Mr. Joshi, I don't know what's more cryptic, the language of this statute or the regulations. But, in the regulations, they talk about the evidence in the record is in equipoise. And I think that that's what you're saying, that the equipoise is what the agency has to find. But, in the regulations, they say that the equipoise has to be between the evidence that supports the claim and the evidence that does not support the claim. So, if you have a claimant who has a doctor who says, I have a disability, and you have a doctor who says, I don't, and you have a doctor who says, I don't know, then you're in equipoise, correct?","Sopan Joshi:  I think, as a matter of logic, that's right, yes.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. But, if you have a claimant who has a doctor who says, I have a disability, and you have two doctors who say, I don't, then the equipoise is broken, correct?","Sopan Joshi:  Yes.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Now, in this case, the agency said, I don't know, and then they said, well, we're going to assume that the doctor who said I don't know is really saying I don't. And then they say, well, now the equipoise is broken. But they never said, we don't believe the doctor who said I do. They just said, we're going to assume that the doctor who said I don't know is really saying I don't. So, in that situation, the equipoise is still maintained, correct?","Sopan Joshi:  So, Justice Sotomayor, I think you're right that the equipoise is still maintained, but I think the premise of your question is that the I don't know evidence is itself evidence that cuts against the veteran, and that's not how I understand it. I understand it to be neutral. It's neither evidence that supports the veteran's claim nor evidence that cuts against it. And so, if you have a world where you have one doctor who says you have it, one doctor who says you don't have it, and one doctor who says I don't know, I think that's an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, then you're not reading the regulation, because the regulation is very clear that it has to be between the evidence that supports the claim and the evidence that does not support the claim. So I don't know how you can read the I don't know doctor as not being evidence that does not support the claim. It doesn't support the claim, so it has to be evidence that does not support the claim.","Sopan Joshi:  Well, I -- I think the -- the regulation, as I read it, is consistent with the statute, which is to say, as I read it, it says the evidence in the record is in equipoise when the evidence that supports the claim is in approximate balance with the evidence that does not support the claim. And I think the evidence that does not support the claim is evidence that cuts against the claim. It's not evidence that's neutral. And I think that's consistent with the way the Secretary has long understood the benefit of the doubt standard, which is that the evidence that cuts against the veteran is evidence that's adverse to the veteran's claim.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if the doctor says, I don't know, you're saying that that's not evidence that cuts against the veteran?","Sopan Joshi:  That's right. I think, if the doctor says, I don't know, it doesn't cut against the veteran. It's neutral. It's neither evidence that supports the claim nor evidence that cuts against the claim.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if you have one doctor who says, I have a disability, and you have one doctor who says, I don't know, you win, the veteran wins?","Sopan Joshi:  Yes, because the -- the -- the evidence that supports the claim is in approximate balance with the evidence that cuts against the claim, which, in that scenario, is zero.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And, here, you had one doctor who said, I don't know, and you had one doctor who said, I don't. And you said, I'm going to assume the doctor who said I don't know is really saying I don't, and, therefore, the equipoise is broken. But you didn't say that the doctor who said I have a disability is not believable. You didn't say anything about that. You just made the assumption that the I don't know doctor is an I don't doctor. So, under that theory, why is the equipoise broken?","Sopan Joshi:  Because the I don't know doctor, in this case, was the agency's doctor, and the agency's doctor, when he said, I don't know, also said, I'm going to go consult the literature, and then he came back and said, I've consulted the literature, and now I think it's less likely than not that you have this condition. And so, at that point, you know, he had gone from I don't know to it's less likely than not. And, at that point, it's not in equipoise. It's tipped against the veteran.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you're not -- you're not -- you're not accepting that the I don't know is a neutral factor. You're saying it's a negative factor.","Sopan Joshi:  No, I'm not saying it's a negative factor. I'm saying, in this case, the I don't know factor became a negative factor when the doctor went back and did the research and said, now I have an opinion, and it's that it's less likely than not.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go to the legal issue.","Sopan Joshi:  Mm-hmm.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm sorry, I'm going to cut you a little bit short. I'm sorry.","Sopan Joshi:  That's okay.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you'll be able to answer the legal issue.","Sopan Joshi:  Right.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  The -- the -- the -- the veteran court said that the agency didn't have to provide a medical opinion. And the agency said, we didn't have to provide a medical opinion because we didn't think the veteran was credible. And so, under Lane, why isn't that a legal issue?","Sopan Joshi:  So, in Lane, the agency had a regulation that said we need to provide a medical opinion if we think you have a particular condition, and the agency didn't do that. And this Court said, well, that was a legal error, it was harmful, and, therefore, you get another shot at it. And so I think, if you have a situation like that where there's a legal error, that is, the agency didn't follow its own regulations, its own procedural rules, then that's a legal error. But, here, the agency did follow its own regulations. It followed the relevant regulation, 3.159(c)(4), which says that you need to provide an opinion only when you have evidence of an in-service event, which the agency found there wasn't here.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what you're saying is that the agency was not required to state its reasons for not providing a medical opinion?","Sopan Joshi:  Well, it did state its reasons, which is, if you look at page 12 of the Joint Appendix, the agency said, we're not going to provide a medical opinion because we don't think there was an in-service injury, event, disease, or -- or injury.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But it didn't say, we don't think you're credible.","Sopan Joshi:  That's right. It didn't say that. And it didn't have to say that.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So you're saying it has no obligation to say why it's not finding something?","Sopan Joshi:  Well, I think, under this Court's decision in Sims, it doesn't have to say why it finds something or doesn't find something, but it does have to provide a statement of reasons or bases, and it did that here. It said, we're not providing a medical opinion because we don't think there was an in-service injury, period.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Thank you.","Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan?","Justice Elena Kagan:  Mr. Joshi, could you say more about the -- the -- the -- the -- the difference between your view and the SG's view?  I mean, you're both saying that there's no de novo review here, but you seem to be proposing a kind of more deferential standard of review than the SG is.","Sopan Joshi:  So I think, if you read our brief, you might think that, but I don't think that's actually the difference between the two of us. I think we're actually on the same page here. I think the only difference between the two of us is that the SG has, I think, a slightly different view of the clear error standard, and it thinks that that standard is more lenient than we do. And so the SG thinks that the clear error standard is a standard that is, you know, maybe even a little bit more deferential than the one that this Court applies in the -- in the -- in the Social Security context. We don't read this Court's Social Security cases that way. We think that they're actually applying the same standard that we think should apply here, which is the one that this Court has traditionally applied in the clear error context, which is, if you could not rule out the possibility of an error, then the Court of Appeals should not find clear error. And so we think that that's the same standard that this Court applies in the Social Security context. It's the same standard that this Court has traditionally applied in the clear error context. And that's the standard that should apply here. So I think that's actually the only difference between us.","Justice Elena Kagan:  And if I could just go back to the Chief Justice's question about the statute, you said, well, the statute is silent as to the standard of review. But the statute does say that the Court shall take due account of the Secretary's -- the -- the -- the Board's -- the Board's application of 5107(b) in making its determination under 7104(a). And I guess what I want to ask you is, what does that mean?  What does it mean to take due account of the Board's application of 5107(b)?","Sopan Joshi:  So I think the most natural way to read that is that you have to review it for clear error. I think, if you review it de novo, you're not taking account of the Board's application of 5107(b). You're essentially disregarding it. And so I think the most natural reading of that language is that it's telling the Veterans Court, when you review the Board's application of 5107(b), you have to do so under a deferential standard of review. And, again, I think that that is entirely consistent with the way this Court has always understood judicial review of agency fact-finding to work.","Justice Elena Kagan:  Thank you.","Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch?","Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I'd like to pick up where Justice Kagan left off. I -- I -- I'd like to understand what you think the difference between your position and the SG's is. I -- I -- I had understood it to be that you thought that the Board's statement of reasons was adequate, that the Board had adequately explained itself, and that the Federal Circuit was wrong to find that it had not, and -- and that that was the basis of your -- your -- your -- your -- your -- your position. Is -- is that right?","Sopan Joshi:  That is not right, Justice Gorsuch.","Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay.","Sopan Joshi:  We think that the Board did not adequately explain itself. And the only question in this case is whether the Board's failure to adequately explain itself was harmless. And we think that it was harmless because the Board's explanation, although inadequate, was not prejudicial to the veteran. And we think that's the only question in this case.","Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And -- and -- and -- and so, if the Board had done a better job of explaining itself, we wouldn't be here?","Sopan Joshi:  That's right.","Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And then, with respect to the -- the equipoise question, I guess I'm -- I'm struggling to understand where in the statute that comes from. I -- I -- I -- I -- I take your point that the -- that the regulation does speak about equipoise, but where -- where do you get that from the statute?","Sopan Joshi:  So, Justice Gorsuch, I think you get it from the statute in the following sense:  The statute tells you that if the evidence is in equipoise, you resolve the tie in favor of the veteran. And I think that that means that if the evidence is not in equipoise, you don't resolve the tie in favor of the veteran. And so I think that's where it comes from. It's not stated in -- in haec verba, but I think that's the only plausible understanding of the statutory language.","Justice Neil Gorsuch:  So you're saying that the equipoise language is just another way of saying a preponderance of the evidence standard?","Sopan Joshi:  No, I don't think that at all. I think that the equipoise language is just a way of saying, if the evidence is in equipoise, you resolve the tie in favor of the veteran. If the evidence is not in equipoise, you don't resolve the tie in favor of the veteran. I don't think it's a -- a -- a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. I think it's a tie goes to the runner standard.","Justice Neil Gorsuch:  But, if I might, just to interrupt, that sounds like a preponderance standard to me, that -- that -- that if it's equipoise, you give the benefit of the doubt to the veteran, but, if it's not equipoise, then you don't. And that sounds like a preponderance standard.","Sopan Joshi:  I don't think so, Justice Gorsuch, because, under a preponderance standard, 51 percent is enough to win. Under this standard, 51 percent is not enough to win. You need a tie to win. And I think that's the fundamental difference between the two standards.","Justice Neil Gorsuch:  So what's the difference between the two standards?","Sopan Joshi:  The difference between the two standards is that, under a preponderance standard, 51 percent is enough to win. Under this standard, 51 percent is not enough to win. You need a tie.","Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I -- I got that part. But, if -- if you're going to say that 51 percent is enough to win, what are you saying the other 49 percent is?","Sopan Joshi:  So, if you have 51 percent, that means that you have evidence that cuts against the veteran's claim and evidence that supports the veteran's claim, and they're not in equipoise. And so, under the statute, you don't resolve that tie in favor of the veteran. You say, I'm sorry, 51 percent is not enough to win.","Justice Neil Gorsuch:  But -- but I guess I'm just not seeing the difference, other than just semantically, that 51 percent is enough to win, and, here, 51 percent is not enough to win.","Sopan Joshi:  Right.

I mean, you're both saying that there's no de novo review here, but you seem to be proposing a kind of more deferential standard of review than the SG is.","Sopan Joshi:  Well, I -- I think the -- the regulation, as I read it, is consistent with the statute, which is to say, as I read it, it says the evidence in the record is in equipoise when the evidence that supports the claim is in approximate balance with the evidence that does not support the claim. And I think the evidence that does not support the claim is evidence that cuts against the claim. It's not evidence that's neutral. And I think that's consistent with the way the Secretary has long understood the benefit of the doubt standard, which is that the evidence that cuts against the veteran is evidence that's adverse to the veteran's claim."],"num_unique_questions":60,"num_questions":60,"prediction":"[\"Justice Elena Kagan:  And if I could just go back to the Chief Justice's question about the statute, you said, well, the statute is silent as to the standard of review. But the statute does say that the Court shall take due account of the Secretary's -- the -- the -- the Board's -- the Board's application of 5107(b) in making its determination under 7104(a). And I guess what I want to ask you is, what does that mean?  What does it mean to take due account of the Board's application of 5107(b)?\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And then, with respect to the -- the equipoise question, I guess I'm -- I'm struggling to understand where in the statute that comes from. I -- I -- I -- I -- I take your point that the -- that the regulation does speak about equipoise, but where -- where do you get that from the statute?\", \"Sopan Joshi:  Yes.\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you'll be able to answer the legal issue.\", \"Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch?\", \"Sopan Joshi:  Because the I don't know doctor, in this case, was the agency's doctor, and the agency's doctor, when he said, I don't know, also said, I'm going to go consult the literature, and then he came back and said, I've consulted the literature, and now I think it's less likely than not that you have this condition. And so, at that point, you know, he had gone from I don't know to it's less likely than not. And, at that point, it's not in equipoise. It's tipped against the veteran.\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  So what's the difference between the two standards?\", \"Sopan Joshi:  Right. I -- I -- I think the difference is that, in one case, you have evidence that cuts against the veteran's claim, and in the other case, you don't have evidence that cuts against the veteran's claim. And so I think that's the difference.\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But it didn't say, we don't think you're credible.\", \"Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kavanaugh?\", \"Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  I have several questions, but I'll try to be brief. First, on the clear error standard, I just want to make sure I understand correctly. You agree, I think, that the Board's statement of reasons must enable a review court to conclude the Board considered each relevant fact. Is that accurate?\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, then you're not reading the regulation, because the regulation is very clear that it has to be between the evidence that supports the claim and the evidence that does not support the claim. So I don't know how you can read the I don't know doctor as not being evidence that does not support the claim. It doesn't support the claim, so it has to be evidence that does not support the claim.\", \"Sopan Joshi:  That's okay.\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm sorry, I'm going to cut you a little bit short. I'm sorry.\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Mr. Joshi, I don't know what's more cryptic, the language of this statute or the regulations. But, in the regulations, they talk about the evidence in the record is in equipoise. And I think that that's what you're saying, that the equipoise is what the agency has to find. But, in the regulations, they say that the equipoise has to be between the evidence that supports the claim and the evidence that does not support the claim. So, if you have a claimant who has a doctor who says, I have a disability, and you have a doctor who says, I don't, and you have a doctor who says, I don't know, then you're in equipoise, correct?\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay. And -- and -- and -- and so, if the Board had done a better job of explaining itself, we wouldn't be here?\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let's go to the legal issue.\", \"Sopan Joshi:  So, in Lane, the agency had a regulation that said we need to provide a medical opinion if we think you have a particular condition, and the agency didn't do that. And this Court said, well, that was a legal error, it was harmful, and, therefore, you get another shot at it. And so I think, if you have a situation like that where there's a legal error, that is, the agency didn't follow its own regulations, its own procedural rules, then that's a legal error. But, here, the agency did follow its own regulations. It followed the relevant regulation, 3.159(c)(4), which says that you need to provide an opinion only when you have evidence of an in-service event, which the agency found there wasn't here.\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Now, in this case, the agency said, I don't know, and then they said, well, we're going to assume that the doctor who said I don't know is really saying I don't. And then they say, well, now the equipoise is broken. But they never said, we don't believe the doctor who said I do. They just said, we're going to assume that the doctor who said I don't know is really saying I don't. So, in that situation, the equipoise is still maintained, correct?\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So you're saying it has no obligation to say why it's not finding something?\", \"Sopan Joshi:  I don't think so, Justice Gorsuch, because, under a preponderance standard, 51 percent is enough to win. Under this standard, 51 percent is not enough to win. You need a tie to win. And I think that's the fundamental difference between the two standards.\", \"Sopan Joshi:  So, if you have 51 percent, that means that you have evidence that cuts against the veteran's claim and evidence that supports the veteran's claim, and they're not in equipoise. And so, under the statute, you don't resolve that tie in favor of the veteran. You say, I'm sorry, 51 percent is not enough to win.\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  The -- the -- the -- the veteran court said that the agency didn't have to provide a medical opinion. And the agency said, we didn't have to provide a medical opinion because we didn't think the veteran was credible. And so, under Lane, why isn't that a legal issue?\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. But, if you have a claimant who has a doctor who says, I have a disability, and you have two doctors who say, I don't, then the equipoise is broken, correct?\", \"Sopan Joshi:  So I think the most natural way to read that is that you have to review it for clear error. I think, if you review it de novo, you're not taking account of the Board's application of 5107(b). You're essentially disregarding it. And so I think the most natural reading of that language is that it's telling the Veterans Court, when you review the Board's application of 5107(b), you have to do so under a deferential standard of review. And, again, I think that that is entirely consistent with the way this Court has always understood judicial review of agency fact-finding to work.\", \"Justice Elena Kagan:  Thank you.\", \"Sopan Joshi:  We think that the Board did not adequately explain itself. And the only question in this case is whether the Board's failure to adequately explain itself was harmless. And we think that it was harmless because the Board's explanation, although inadequate, was not prejudicial to the veteran. And we think that's the only question in this case.\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  So you're saying that the equipoise language is just another way of saying a preponderance of the evidence standard?\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  But -- but I guess I'm just not seeing the difference, other than just semantically, that 51 percent is enough to win, and, here, 51 percent is not enough to win.\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Okay.\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Well, I think that's slicing the baloney a little thin for me, but I'll let it go. Thank you.\", \"Sopan Joshi:  That's right. I think, if the doctor says, I don't know, it doesn't cut against the veteran. It's neutral. It's neither evidence that supports the claim nor evidence that cuts against the claim.\", \"Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan?\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I'd like to pick up where Justice Kagan left off. I -- I -- I'd like to understand what you think the difference between your position and the SG's is. I -- I -- I had understood it to be that you thought that the Board's statement of reasons was adequate, that the Board had adequately explained itself, and that the Federal Circuit was wrong to find that it had not, and -- and that that was the basis of your -- your -- your -- your -- your -- your position. Is -- is that right?\", \"Sopan Joshi:  So, Justice Sotomayor, I think you're right that the equipoise is still maintained, but I think the premise of your question is that the I don't know evidence is itself evidence that cuts against the veteran, and that's not how I understand it. I understand it to be neutral. It's neither evidence that supports the veteran's claim nor evidence that cuts against it. And so, if you have a world where you have one doctor who says you have it, one doctor who says you don't have it, and one doctor who says I don't know, I think that's an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence.\", \"Sopan Joshi:  No, I'm not saying it's a negative factor. I'm saying, in this case, the I don't know factor became a negative factor when the doctor went back and did the research and said, now I have an opinion, and it's that it's less likely than not.\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what you're saying is that the agency was not required to state its reasons for not providing a medical opinion?\", \"Sopan Joshi:  So I think, if you read our brief, you might think that, but I don't think that's actually the difference between the two of us. I think we're actually on the same page here. I think the only difference between the two of us is that the SG has, I think, a slightly different view of the clear error standard, and it thinks that that standard is more lenient than we do. And so the SG thinks that the clear error standard is a standard that is, you know, maybe even a little bit more deferential than the one that this Court applies in the -- in the -- in the Social Security context. We don't read this Court's Social Security cases that way. We think that they're actually applying the same standard that we think should apply here, which is the one that this Court has traditionally applied in the clear error context, which is, if you could not rule out the possibility of an error, then the Court of Appeals should not find clear error. And so we think that that's the same standard that this Court applies in the Social Security context. It's the same standard that this Court has traditionally applied in the clear error context. And that's the standard that should apply here. So I think that's actually the only difference between us.\", \"Sopan Joshi:  That is not right, Justice Gorsuch.\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And, here, you had one doctor who said, I don't know, and you had one doctor who said, I don't. And you said, I'm going to assume the doctor who said I don't know is really saying I don't, and, therefore, the equipoise is broken. But you didn't say that the doctor who said I have a disability is not believable. You didn't say anything about that. You just made the assumption that the I don't know doctor is an I don't doctor. So, under that theory, why is the equipoise broken?\", \"Sopan Joshi:  That's right.\", \"Sopan Joshi:  Well, I think, under this Court's decision in Sims, it doesn't have to say why it finds something or doesn't find something, but it does have to provide a statement of reasons or bases, and it did that here. It said, we're not providing a medical opinion because we don't think there was an in-service injury, period.\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I -- I got that part. But, if -- if you're going to say that 51 percent is enough to win, what are you saying the other 49 percent is?\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But you're not -- you're not -- you're not accepting that the I don't know is a neutral factor. You're saying it's a negative factor.\", \"Justice Neil Gorsuch:  But, if I might, just to interrupt, that sounds like a preponderance standard to me, that -- that -- that if it's equipoise, you give the benefit of the doubt to the veteran, but, if it's not equipoise, then you don't. And that sounds like a preponderance standard.\", \"Sopan Joshi:  Yes, because the -- the -- the evidence that supports the claim is in approximate balance with the evidence that cuts against the claim, which, in that scenario, is zero.\", \"Sopan Joshi:  No, I don't think that at all. I think that the equipoise language is just a way of saying, if the evidence is in equipoise, you resolve the tie in favor of the veteran. If the evidence is not in equipoise, you don't resolve the tie in favor of the veteran. I don't think it's a -- a -- a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. I think it's a tie goes to the runner standard.\", \"Sopan Joshi:  The difference between the two standards is that, under a preponderance standard, 51 percent is enough to win. Under this standard, 51 percent is not enough to win. You need a tie.\", \"Sopan Joshi:  Fair enough.\", \"Sopan Joshi:  I think, as a matter of logic, that's right, yes.\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if the doctor says, I don't know, you're saying that that's not evidence that cuts against the veteran?\", \"Sopan Joshi:  That's right. It didn't say that. And it didn't have to say that.\", \"Sopan Joshi:  Right.\", \"Sopan Joshi:  So, Justice Gorsuch, I think you get it from the statute in the following sense:  The statute tells you that if the evidence is in equipoise, you resolve the tie in favor of the veteran. And I think that that means that if the evidence is not in equipoise, you don't resolve the tie in favor of the veteran. And so I think that's where it comes from. It's not stated in -- in haec verba, but I think that's the only plausible understanding of the statutory language.\", \"Sopan Joshi:  Well, it did state its reasons, which is, if you look at page 12 of the Joint Appendix, the agency said, we're not going to provide a medical opinion because we don't think there was an in-service injury, event, disease, or -- or injury.\", \"Sopan Joshi:  Mm-hmm.\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Thank you.\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if you have one doctor who says, I have a disability, and you have one doctor who says, I don't know, you win, the veteran wins?\", \"Justice Elena Kagan:  Mr. Joshi, could you say more about the -- the -- the -- the -- the difference between your view and the SG's view?  I mean, you're both saying that there's no de novo review here, but you seem to be proposing a kind of more deferential standard of review than the SG is.\", \"Sopan Joshi:  Well, I -- I think the -- the regulation, as I read it, is consistent with the statute, which is to say, as I read it, it says the evidence in the record is in equipoise when the evidence that supports the claim is in approximate balance with the evidence that does not support the claim.

Alito, Jr. is likely to ask:\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Mr. Yang, you've just said that a preliminary injunction is not a judgment. Is that correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So why do you think that it's not entered?  It's not entered?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So it's not entered?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, what is the answer to my question?  If it's not entered, why is it not entered?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me ask you this. Suppose that a district court enters a preliminary injunction and then the defendant moves for summary judgment, and the district court denies summary judgment. Can the defendant take an interlocutory appeal at that time?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  No, the defendant cannot take an interlocutory appeal at that time?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So, if it's not a judgment, it's not appealable. If it's not appealable, how can it be immediately appealed?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So it is immediately appealable, but it is not a judgment?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So it's a judgment but not a judgment?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So it's a judgment but not a final judgment?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me switch to a different tack. So you say that the -- the -- the question here is whether the plaintiff has obtained some relief on the merits. What if the preliminary injunction is based on a procedural issue?  What if it's based on a timeliness issue?  What if it's based on personal jurisdiction?  Would that be sufficient?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  What if it's based on a procedural issue?  Would that be sufficient?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, it's not a merits issue, right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So it's not a merits issue. It's a procedural issue. So it's not sufficient?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So you're saying that the preliminary injunction has to be based on the merits, not on a procedural issue?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So the preliminary injunction has to be based on the merits, not on a procedural issue, but it doesn't have to be a final determination of the merits?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me ask you about the -- the -- the -- the mootness question. So the plaintiff gets a preliminary injunction and then the case becomes moot. The plaintiff then moves for fees. The district court says:  Well, I'm not going to decide that until after the Court of Appeals rules on the appealability of the preliminary injunction. So the Court of Appeals says it is appealable. It goes back to the district court. The district court says:  Well, now the case is moot, and under Buckhannon, a plaintiff cannot be a prevailing party when the case is moot. And, therefore, I'm not going to award fees. Can't that happen?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that would be --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that would be a ruling that the plaintiff was not a prevailing party because the case was moot. But that would be a ruling on the merits, wouldn't it?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  It would be a ruling on the merits?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So, if the district court can do that, then why can't the district court do exactly the same thing before the appeal is taken?  It gets the motion for fees. It says:  Well, I'm not going to rule on this until the Court of Appeals says whether this is appealable. The Court of Appeals says it is appealable. It goes back to the district court. The district court says:  Now it's moot. Under Buckhannon, you are not a prevailing party. Now, if the district court can do that, why can't it do exactly the same thing before the appeal is taken?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, it can do that, right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  It can do that, right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So it can do that, right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So, in that situation, the district court can say it's moot, you're not a prevailing party, you don't get fees, period. End of case.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A.

So, if it's not a judgment, it's not appealable. If it's not appealable, how can it be immediately appealed?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So it is immediately appealable, but it is not a judgment?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So it's a judgment but not a judgment?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So it's a judgment but not a final judgment?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me switch to a different tack. So you say that the -- the -- the question here is whether the plaintiff has obtained some relief on the merits. What if the preliminary injunction is based on a procedural issue?  What if it's based on a timeliness issue?  What if it's based on personal jurisdiction?  Would that be sufficient?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  What if it's based on a procedural issue?  Would that be sufficient?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, it's not a merits issue, right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So it's not a merits issue. It's a procedural issue. So it's not sufficient?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So you're saying that the preliminary injunction has to be based on the merits, not on a procedural issue?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So the preliminary injunction has to be based on the merits, not on a procedural issue, but it doesn't have to be a final determination of the merits?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me ask you about the -- the -- the -- the mootness question. So the plaintiff gets a preliminary injunction and then the case becomes moot. The plaintiff then moves for fees. The district court says:  Well, I'm not going to decide that until after the Court of Appeals rules on the appealability of the preliminary injunction. So the Court of Appeals says it is appealable. It goes back to the district court. The district court says:  Well, now the case is moot, and under Buckhannon, a plaintiff cannot be a prevailing party when the case is moot. And, therefore, I'm not going to award fees. Can't that happen?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that would be --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that would be a ruling that the plaintiff was not a prevailing party because the case was moot. But that would be a ruling on the merits, wouldn't it?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  It would be a ruling on the merits?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So, if the district court can do that, then why can't the district court do exactly the same thing before the appeal is taken?  It gets the motion for fees. It says:  Well, I'm not going to rule on this until the Court of Appeals says whether this is appealable. The Court of Appeals says it is appealable. It goes back to the district court. The district court says:  Now it's moot. Under Buckhannon, you are not a prevailing party. Now, if the district court can do that, why can't it do exactly the same thing before the appeal is taken?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, it can do that, right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  It can do that, right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So it can do that, right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So, in that situation, the district court can say it's moot, you're not a prevailing party, you don't get fees, period. End of case.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A.

The text differentiates the injury from racketeering and the damages sustained from that injury, thus showing that injury and damages are distinct.

To quote the complaint:  \"Defendant's behavior caused  Plaintiff's fiscal harm in the ingestion of Dixie, and as a direct result of consuming this  product, he was dismissed from his employment.\" That's a personal injury claim outside civil RICO. Respondent argues that every economic loss is its own RICO injury but not to worry because RICO still bars non-pecuniary damages. But that view conflates injury and damages by treating RICO's exclusion of personal injuries as just excluding a narrow type of damages: pain and suffering and emotional distress. Respondent's rule also leaves the personal exclusion toothless since virtually all personal injuries result in monetary loss. It is utterly implausible that Congress federalized every slip and fall involving RICO predicates.

The first is about the \"damages sustained\" locution in Section 1964(c). That means  compensatory damages. We know that from the rest of the U.S. Code, the syntax of the sentence, and the plain meaning of the word \"damages.\"  So rest of  the U.S. Code, that locution, \"damages sustained,\" appears some three dozen times in the U.S. Code. It always means compensatory damages. So we point you to the example of 18 U.S.C. 2255, where victims of crime choose between liquidated damages and damages sustained. You can't choose between liquidated damages and harm. Those have to be two measures of compensation. Syntax of the rest of the sentence. The sentence says:  Recover the damages sustained. If it meant harm, you would expect it to say \"recover for the damages sustained.\" You recover for harm. You don't recover the harm. But, if it means compensatory damages, that's a perfectly sensible sentence. And, finally, the plain meaning of \"damages.\"  Every dictionary will tell you  damages is a measure of compensation, including the treatise that Petitioners cite at page 15 of their opening brief. So, absent that textual hook, the other problem with Petitioners' rule is they  still have not told you how to distinguish the human trafficking case from this case. Here are some of the things I heard my friend say:  Look at the Restatement. Well, we think the relevant Restatement principle is Section 525, the fraudulent misrepresentation tort. That's the only state law tort that survived to trial, right?  It's not a product liability claim. It's an economic tort, fraudulent misrepresentation. She said:  Look to a legal right. Well, Sedima tells us that the legal right protected by RICO is the right not to be harmed by reason of the predicate acts. She said:  Look at whether money was taken. This isn't a forfeiture or a unjust enrichment statute, right?  It's not worded that way. She said:  Look to directness. As Justice Kagan explained, that's a proximate cause problem. We recognize we have a heavy burden on remand, but that's not the argument before you. And she said:  Look at what is trying to be redressed.

Alito, Jr.:  Counsel, I'm interested in your answer to the question I asked your friend about the distinction between the harm that was inflicted and the damages that flow from the harm. So, if a person is fired because of a RICO violation, the harm is the firing. And then the question is, what damages flow from that harm?  So why is it not possible to say that the harm is the firing and the damages are the lost wages?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Easha Anand:  So, Justice Alito, I think the reason why that's not possible is because the harm is not the firing. The harm is the firing by reason of the predicate acts. And I think that's what the Court said in Holmes. So the harm is the harm that's inflicted by the predicate act.

So I think that the harm is the firing by reason of the predicate act. And so, if you're not trying to redress the harm caused by the predicate act, you're not trying to redress the harm. And so the question is, are you trying to redress the harm caused by the predicate act?  And I think that's a question that looks to the substantive law of the predicate act. So, here, the substantive law of the predicate act is the fraudulent misrepresentation tort. It looks to whether the defendant's fraud caused the firing. So, if you're not trying to redress that harm, you're not trying to redress the harm caused by the predicate act. And I think that's what the Court said in Holmes, which is, if you're not trying to redress the harm caused by the predicate act, you're not proximate.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A.

It's the loss of wages.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Easha Anand:  So I think that's a little bit of a semantic dispute, Justice Alito. I think that the harm is the firing. And so I think that if you're not trying to redress the harm caused by the predicate act, you're not proximate. And so I think that's why the Court in Holmes said, if you're not trying to redress the harm caused by the predicate act, you're not proximate. And so I think that's why the Court in Holmes said, if you're not trying to redress the harm caused by the predicate act, you're not proximate.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A.

So, if it's not the loss of wages, what is the harm that is inflicted by the RICO violation?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Easha Anand:  So the harm that's inflicted by the RICO violation is the harm caused by the predicate act. And so, here, the predicate act is the fraudulent misrepresentation, and the harm caused by that is the firing. And so the harm that's inflicted by the RICO violation is the firing.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Okay.

And I think you agree with that. And then, when you apply proximate cause, I think you're going to lose because you're going to lose under the proximate cause analysis. And I think that's why you're trying to come up with a different test. And I think you're trying to come up with a different test because the Restatement test, the First Restatement test, is not going to work for you. So then you're going to the Second Restatement test, and that's not going to work for you. So then you're going to the Third Restatement test, and that's not going to work for you. So then you're trying to come up with a different test. And I just don't think that's going to work. So, if you could address that.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Easha Anand:  Sure, Your Honor. So I think that's not correct.

Alito, Jr.\n        Opening Statement: <speaker>Elizabeth B. Prelogar<\/speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Gun Control Act imposes straightforward but essential requirements. Firearms sellers and manufacturers must mark their products with serial numbers, maintain sales records, and conduct background checks. The industry has followed those conditions without difficulty for more than half a century, and those basic requirements are crucial to solving gun crimes and keeping guns out of the hands of minors, felons, and domestic abusers. But, in recent years, companies like the Respondents here have tried to circumvent those requirements. They've begun selling firearms as easy -to-assemble kits and frames and receivers that require minimal work to be made functional. They've advertised the products, in their words, as \"ridiculously easy to assemble and dummy-proof\" and touted that you can go from opening the mail to have a fully functional gun  in as little as 15 minutes, no serial number, background check, or records required. Those untraceable guns are attractive to people who can't lawfully purchase them or  who plan to use them in crimes. As a result, our nation has seen an explosion in crimes committed with ghost guns. In the face of that public safety crisis, ATF promulgated this rule to underscore two points about the Gun Control Act's plain text. First, a weapon parts kit that can readily be converted to function as a gun with common tools, often in under an hour, is a covered firearm. Second, a product is a frame or receiver under the Act even if the buyer must drill a few holes or remove a few superfluous pieces of plastic to make it functional. Both of those points are consistent with how ATF has interpreted and implemented the Act across five decades and 11 different presidential administrations. Respondents now seek a sea change in the Act's scope. They claim that if a firearm isn't a hundred percent functional, if it's  missing just one hole that could be drilled in seconds and immediately assembled into a working gun, that product can be sold to anyone online  with no background check, no records, and no serial number. That contradicts the Act's plain text, and it also contradicts common sense. This Court should make clear that the Act regulates these products as what they are, firearms and frames and receivers of firearms.

First, Congress altered the common understanding of \"firearm\" to include other  weapons that may readily be converted to firearms. Second, in a departure from prior federal law, Congress decided to regulate only a  single part of a firearm, the frame or receiver, and Congress did not alter the common understanding of a \"frame or receiver.\"  ATF has now exceeded its authority by operating outside of the bounds set by Congress. One, ATF has expanded the definition of \"frame or receiver\" to include items that may readily be converted to a frame or receiver. And, two, ATF has expanded the definition of \"firearm\" to include collections of parts that are not weapons and that do not include a frame or receiver. Some concern has been raised about circumvention, but, of course, complying with a statute is not circumventing it. And as this Court said in Abramski, which has already been referenced, Congress, in the Gun Control Act,  did not seek to pursue its purposes of controlling access to firearms to the nth degree. And, notably, Congress did not regulate the secondary market for firearms, and that secondary market is a much bigger source of firearms for criminals than privately made firearms. There also has been questions raised about the agency's prior practice. There definitely has been a sea change by the agency here. The agency projected that its rule would put 42 out of 43 unlicensed manufacturers out of business. And what the agency said in the Syracuse litigation was they said:  \"An unfinished frame or receiver does not meet the statutory definition of 'firearm' simply because it can be designed to or can readily be converted into a frame or receiver.\"  That's the exact standard t hey've now adopted. Instead, what they looked at was whether critical machining operations had taken place. And, to be clear, we have no quarrel with that prior practice. We have raised as alternatives, one, something has to be  completely machined, or, two, the critical machining operation test. And the -- the latter, we submit, is more consistent with the statutory language and solves the machine gun problem because, if you say, in the machine gun provision, a frame or receiver is also regulated, and if one hole is all that separates a semi-automatic receiver from a machine gun receiver, it's hard to see how the \"readily\" standard would not also be applied there.

Alito, Jr.\n        Opening Statement: <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  This case turns on decisions made by Congress in the Gun Control Act of 1968. First, Congress altered the common understanding of \"firearm\" to include other  weapons that may readily be converted to firearms. Second, in a departure from prior federal law, Congress decided to regulate only a  single part of a firearm, the frame or receiver, and Congress did not alter the common understanding of a \"frame or receiver.\"  ATF has now exceeded its authority by operating outside of the bounds set by Congress. One, ATF has expanded the definition of \"frame or receiver\" to include items that may readily be converted to a frame or receiver. And, two, ATF has expanded the definition of \"firearm\" to include collections of parts that are not weapons and that do not include a frame or receiver. Some concern has been raised about circumvention, but, of course, complying with a statute is not circumventing it. And as this Court said in Abramski, which has already been referenced, Congress, in the Gun Control Act,  did not seek to pursue its purposes of controlling access to firearms to the nth degree. And, notably, Congress did not regulate the secondary market for firearms, and that secondary market is a much bigger source of firearms for criminals than privately made firearms. There also has been questions raised about the agency's prior practice. There definitely has been a sea change by the agency here. The agency projected that its rule would put 42 out of 43 unlicensed manufacturers out of business. And what the agency said in the Syracuse litigation was they said:  \"An unfinished frame or receiver does not meet the statutory definition of 'firearm' simply because it can be designed to or can readily be converted into a frame or receiver.\"  That's the exact standard t hey've now adopted. Instead, what they looked at was whether critical machining operations had taken place. And, to be clear, we have no quarrel with that prior practice. We have raised as alternatives, one, something has to be  completely machined, or, two, the critical machining operation test. And the -- the latter, we submit, is more consistent with the statutory language and solves the machine gun problem because, if you say, in the machine gun provision, a frame or receiver is also regulated, and if one hole is all that separates a semi-automatic receiver from a machine gun receiver, it's hard to see how the \"readily\" standard would not also be applied there. I welcome the Court's questions.<\/text>\n\n        ### Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Mr. Patterson, would you spend a little time on the 922(g) and the 922(n)  --<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Sure.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  -- provisions and how they work together?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Yes. So I -- I think 922(g) is the easier of the two because, there, the -- the possession is -- is possession of a firearm, and it's the same definition of \"firearm\" that is used throughout the Gun Control Act. And so it's possession of a firearm, and that's the same as 922(n). But the -- the -- the critical difference is, in 922(g), you have to have a prior conviction, and in 922(n), you do not. And so that's the -- the difference between the two. And that's why 922(n) is used in a lot of these cases. But it's still the same definition of \"firearm.\"<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So, if you're a convicted felon, you're in 922(g)  --<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Sure.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  -- and you possess a firearm?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Yes, that's right. And 922(n) is for the possession of a firearm or ammunition by a person who is prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm or ammunition. And so that's someone who's under indictment or someone who is a fugitive. And so it's -- it's not -- it's not -- it's not the same thing, but the same definition of \"firearm\" applies in both.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  And you would include the receiver in that?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Yes, we would. And -- and the government does not dispute that.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So, if you're a convicted felon, you're in 922(g), and you possess a receiver, you're in trouble?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Yes. That's right. That's right. And that's the way the government has always prosecuted these cases. They've always --<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  And that's what you're arguing?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Yes. Yes, that's right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  That's the same argument you're making?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Yes. Yes, that's right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  And you have no problem with that?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> That's right. That's right. I mean, we have no problem with the government prosecuting people who possess firearms or receivers. We have a problem with them prosecuting people who possess firearms or receivers that are not firearms or receivers. And so that's -- that's the distinction that we're drawing.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So, if you possess a receiver that's not a firearm, you're not in trouble?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> That's right. That's right. And -- and, you know, I think it's worth noting that the government has not disputed that. They have not disputed that a receiver that is not a firearm is not a firearm. And I think that's telling because, if you look at the statute, it's -- it's possession of a firearm or ammunition. It's not possession of a firearm or a receiver. And so it's -- it's the same definition of \"firearm\" that applies to both.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  But you just said that if you possess a receiver, you're in trouble.<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I'm sorry. If you possess a receiver that is a firearm, you're in trouble. But, if you possess a receiver that is not a firearm, you are not in trouble.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So the problem is you don't know until you're prosecuted?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I think -- I think the way the statute is written, it's -- it's -- it's the same definition of \"firearm\" that applies in both. And so, if -- if you possess a firearm, you are prohibited. And if you possess a receiver that is a firearm, you are prohibited. But, if you possess a receiver that is not a firearm, you are not prohibited.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So you're just arguing for clarity?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> We're arguing for -- for -- for the statute to be read the way Congress wrote it. And -- and Congress did not write this statute to say that a receiver that is not a firearm is a firearm. And so that's -- that's the distinction that we're drawing.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Clarence Thomas:  Thank you.<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel  --<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Counsel, what  --what if the defendant has a receiver and a bunch of other parts, you know, the barrel, the trigger, and so on and so forth, but not a complete firearm?  Is possessing that a violation?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> No, it's not a violation, Your Honor, because the definition of \"firearm\" is a weapon from which a shot may be discharged, and that's the definition of \"firearm\" that's used throughout the Gun Control Act. And so, if you have a collection of parts, that is not a firearm. That's not a weapon from which a shot may be discharged.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, what if he has a -- a -- a -- a -- a pipe bomb, and he has a fuse, but he hasn't connected the two yet?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if he has a pipe bomb, that's an explosive, and that's not a firearm. And so, if he has a pipe bomb and he has a fuse, that's still not a firearm.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, no, but he has the  -- he has the materials to make a firearm, an explosive, and he hasn't connected them yet.<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if he has the materials to make an explosive, that's not an explosive. And so, if he has the materials to make a firearm, that's not a firearm. And that's the way the statute is written. And I think it's notable that Congress did not regulate the secondary market for firearms. It did not regulate the possession of firearms by unlicensed persons. It regulated the possession of firearms by certain prohibited persons, but it did not regulate the possession of firearms by unlicensed persons. And so I think that's telling.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Justice Clarence Thomas:  Nothing further.<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Alito?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  The government's argument is that the term \"firearm\" is sometimes used to refer to the complete weapon and sometimes to refer to a part of a weapon, and the -- the part that is most relevant here is the frame or the receiver, and that's because that is the linchpin, that's the central part of the weapon to which all of the other parts are attached. So what is your answer to that?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I think, if you look at the common understanding of \"firearm,\" it is not a part of a weapon. It is a weapon. And if you look at the definition of \"firearm\" in the Gun Control Act, it is a weapon from which a shot may be discharged. And so I think that's the common understanding of \"firearm\" and the definition of \"firearm\" in the Gun Control Act. And so, if you look at the statute, it says it's possession of a firearm or ammunition. It's not possession of a firearm or a receiver. And so I think that's telling. And I think it's also telling that, if you look at the provision of the Gun Control Act that regulates the possession of firearms by prohibited persons, it says it's the possession of a firearm or ammunition. It does not say it's the possession of a firearm or a frame or receiver. And so I think that's telling.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, let me ask you this --<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Yes.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  -- about the meaning of the term \"firearm.\"  In 922(g), it says a person who has been convicted of a felony may not \"possess in or affecting commerce any firearm or ammunition.\"  Now, if that means a complete weapon, what sense does it make to say \"in or affecting commerce\"?  If it's a complete weapon, it's obvious that it's in commerce. It's being carried around by somebody. But, if it's the frame or the receiver, then it makes sense to say \"in or affecting commerce\" because you can have the frame or the receiver in one place and the other parts in another place.<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if you look at the statute, the statute is regulating the possession of firearms or ammunition. And so, if you look at the provision that regulates the possession of firearms by prohibited persons, it says it's the possession of a firearm or ammunition. And so I think that's telling. And I think it's also telling that the statute does not say it's the possession of a firearm or a frame or receiver. And so I think that's telling. And I think, if you look at the common understanding of \"firearm,\" it is not a part of a weapon. It is a weapon. And if you look at the definition of \"firearm\" in the Gun Control Act, it is a weapon from which a shot may be discharged. And so I think that's the common understanding of \"firearm\" and the definition of \"firearm\" in the Gun Control Act.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, let me ask you this --<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Yes.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  -- about the meaning of \"readily.\"  Suppose someone has a -- a weapon that is capable of firing more than one round automatically without a reload, and it has a switch, but the switch is not connected up. And so, if you turn the switch, nothing will happen. You have to take the weapon apart and connect the switch. How many hours would a gunsmith have to take to do that in order for that to qualify as being readily assembled?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if you look at the provision of the statute that regulates machine guns, it says that a machine gun is any weapon which shoots automatically more than one shot without manual reloading. And so I think, if you have a weapon that is not currently capable of shooting automatically more than one shot without manual reloading, it's not a machine gun.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that wasn't my question. My question is, when would it be readily assembled?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if you look at the statute, the statute says it's readily assembled if it's designed to or may readily be assembled. And so I think, if you have a weapon that is not designed to be assembled, that's not readily assembled. And if you have a weapon that may not readily be assembled, that's not readily assembled. And so I think, if you have a weapon that is not currently capable of shooting automatically more than one shot without manual reloading, it's not a machine gun.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, what does \"readily\" mean?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think \"readily\" means  -- I mean, it's not  -- it's not defined in the statute, but I think, if you look at the dictionary definition of \"readily,\" it's -- it's -- it's easily assembled. And so, if you have a weapon that is not easily assembled, it's not readily assembled.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, how much time would a gunsmith have to take?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if you look at the provision of the statute that regulates short-barrel shotguns, it says that if you have a shotgun that has a barrel of less than 18 inches in length, it's a short-barrel shotgun. And so I think that's telling because, if you look at the provision of the statute that regulates machine guns, it says that a machine gun is any weapon which shoots automatically more than one shot without manual reloading. And so I think, if you have a weapon that is not currently capable of shooting automatically more than one shot without manual reloading, it's not a machine gun.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, what if it is a short-barrel shotgun and it has a switch, but the switch is not connected up?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if you have a short-barrel shotgun, it's a short-barrel shotgun. And if you have a weapon that is not currently capable of shooting automatically more than one shot without manual reloading, it's not a machine gun.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  What if it's readily assembled?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if you look at the statute, the statute says it's readily assembled if it's designed to or may readily be assembled. And so I think, if you have a weapon that is not designed to be assembled, that's not readily assembled. And if you have a weapon that may not readily be assembled, that's not readily assembled.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  How much time would a gunsmith have to take to connect the switch?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if you look at the provision of the statute that regulates short-barrel shotguns, it says that if you have a shotgun that has a barrel of less than 18 inches in length, it's a short-barrel shotgun. And so I think that's telling.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  That doesn't answer my question. How much time would a gunsmith have to take?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if you look at the provision of the statute that regulates short-barrel shotguns, it says that if you have a shotgun that has a barrel of less than 18 inches in length, it's a short-barrel shotgun. And so I think that's telling.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  That doesn't answer my question.<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> I'm sorry.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  How much time would a gunsmith have to take to connect the switch?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if you look at the provision of the statute that regulates machine guns, it says that a machine gun is any weapon which shoots automatically more than one shot without manual reloading. And so I think, if you have a weapon that is not currently capable of shooting automatically more than one shot without manual reloading, it's not a machine gun.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me ask one more question. The  -- the definition of \"firearm\" in 921(a)(3) includes a frame or receiver. And you say that means only a complete frame or receiver. But why wouldn't it also include an incomplete frame or receiver, just like an incomplete firearm?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if you look at the provision of the statute that regulates firearms, it says that a firearm is a weapon from which a shot may be discharged. And so I think, if you have a weapon that is not currently capable of discharging a shot, it's not a firearm. And I think, if you look at the provision of the statute that regulates frames or receivers, it says that a frame or receiver is a firearm. And so I think, if you have a frame or receiver that is not currently capable of discharging a shot, it's not a firearm.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:","cleaned":"        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Mr. Patterson, would you spend a little time on the 922(g) and the 922(n)  --<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A.

Roberts, Jr.:  Counsel, what  --what if the defendant has a receiver and a bunch of other parts, you know, the barrel, the trigger, and so on and so forth, but not a complete firearm?  Is possessing that a violation?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> No, it's not a violation, Your Honor, because the definition of \"firearm\" is a weapon from which a shot may be discharged, and that's the definition of \"firearm\" that's used throughout the Gun Control Act. And so, if you have a collection of parts, that is not a firearm. That's not a weapon from which a shot may be discharged.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, what if he has a -- a -- a -- a -- a pipe bomb, and he has a fuse, but he hasn't connected the two yet?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if he has a pipe bomb, that's an explosive, and that's not a firearm. And so, if he has a pipe bomb and he has a fuse, that's still not a firearm.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, no, but he has the  -- he has the materials to make a firearm, an explosive, and he hasn't connected them yet.<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if he has the materials to make an explosive, that's not an explosive. And so, if he has the materials to make a firearm, that's not a firearm. And that's the way the statute is written. And I think it's notable that Congress did not regulate the secondary market for firearms. It did not regulate the possession of firearms by unlicensed persons. It regulated the possession of firearms by certain prohibited persons, but it did not regulate the possession of firearms by unlicensed persons. And so I think that's telling.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Justice Clarence Thomas:  Nothing further.<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Alito?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  The government's argument is that the term \"firearm\" is sometimes used to refer to the complete weapon and sometimes to refer to a part of a weapon, and the -- the part that is most relevant here is the frame or the receiver, and that's because that is the linchpin, that's the central part of the weapon to which all of the other parts are attached. So what is your answer to that?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I think, if you look at the common understanding of \"firearm,\" it is not a part of a weapon. It is a weapon. And if you look at the definition of \"firearm\" in the Gun Control Act, it is a weapon from which a shot may be discharged. And so I think that's the common understanding of \"firearm\" and the definition of \"firearm\" in the Gun Control Act. And so, if you look at the statute, it says it's possession of a firearm or ammunition. It's not possession of a firearm or a receiver. And so I think that's telling. And I think it's also telling that, if you look at the provision of the Gun Control Act that regulates the possession of firearms by prohibited persons, it says it's the possession of a firearm or ammunition. It does not say it's the possession of a firearm or a frame or receiver. And so I think that's telling.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, let me ask you this --<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Yes.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  -- about the meaning of the term \"firearm.\"  In 922(g), it says a person who has been convicted of a felony may not \"possess in or affecting commerce any firearm or ammunition.\"  Now, if that means a complete weapon, what sense does it make to say \"in or affecting commerce\"?  If it's a complete weapon, it's obvious that it's in commerce. It's being carried around by somebody. But, if it's the frame or the receiver, then it makes sense to say \"in or affecting commerce\" because you can have the frame or the receiver in one place and the other parts in another place.<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if you look at the statute, the statute is regulating the possession of firearms or ammunition. And so, if you look at the provision that regulates the possession of firearms by prohibited persons, it says it's the possession of a firearm or ammunition. And so I think that's telling. And I think it's also telling that the statute does not say it's the possession of a firearm or a frame or receiver. And so I think that's telling. And I think, if you look at the common understanding of \"firearm,\" it is not a part of a weapon. It is a weapon. And if you look at the definition of \"firearm\" in the Gun Control Act, it is a weapon from which a shot may be discharged. And so I think that's the common understanding of \"firearm\" and the definition of \"firearm\" in the Gun Control Act.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.:  -- about the meaning of \"readily.\"  Suppose someone has a -- a weapon that is capable of firing more than one round automatically without a reload, and it has a switch, but the switch is not connected up. And so, if you turn the switch, nothing will happen. You have to take the weapon apart and connect the switch. How many hours would a gunsmith have to take to do that in order for that to qualify as being readily assembled?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if you look at the provision of the statute that regulates machine guns, it says that a machine gun is any weapon which shoots automatically more than one shot without manual reloading. And so I think, if you have a weapon that is not currently capable of shooting automatically more than one shot without manual reloading, it's not a machine gun.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that wasn't my question. My question is, when would it be readily assembled?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if you look at the statute, the statute says it's readily assembled if it's designed to or may readily be assembled. And so I think, if you have a weapon that is not designed to be assembled, that's not readily assembled. And if you have a weapon that may not readily be assembled, that's not readily assembled. And so I think, if you have a weapon that is not currently capable of shooting automatically more than one shot without manual reloading, it's not a machine gun.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, what does \"readily\" mean?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think \"readily\" means  -- I mean, it's not  -- it's not defined in the statute, but I think, if you look at the dictionary definition of \"readily,\" it's -- it's -- it's easily assembled. And so, if you have a weapon that is not easily assembled, it's not readily assembled.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, how much time would a gunsmith have to take?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if you look at the provision of the statute that regulates short-barrel shotguns, it says that if you have a shotgun that has a barrel of less than 18 inches in length, it's a short-barrel shotgun. And so I think that's telling because, if you look at the provision of the statute that regulates machine guns, it says that a machine gun is any weapon which shoots automatically more than one shot without manual reloading. And so I think, if you have a weapon that is not currently capable of shooting automatically more than one shot without manual reloading, it's not a machine gun.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A.

And if you have a weapon that may not readily be assembled, that's not readily assembled.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A.

And so I think that's telling.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  That doesn't answer my question.

Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me ask one more question. The  -- the definition of \"firearm\" in 921(a)(3) includes a frame or receiver. And you say that means only a complete frame or receiver. But why wouldn't it also include an incomplete frame or receiver, just like an incomplete firearm?<\/speaker>\n        <speaker>Peter A. Patterson<\/speaker>\n        <text> Well, I mean, I think, if you look at the provision of the statute that regulates firearms, it says that a firearm is a weapon from which a shot may be discharged. And so I think, if you have a weapon that is not currently capable of discharging a shot, it's not a firearm. And I think, if you look at the provision of the statute that regulates frames or receivers, it says that a frame or receiver is a firearm. And so I think, if you have a frame or receiver that is not currently capable of discharging a shot, it's not a firearm.<\/text>\n        <\/text>\n        <speaker>Justice Samuel A.

They have not disputed that a receiver that is not a firearm is not a firearm. And I think that's telling because, if you look at the statute, it's -- it's possession of a firearm or ammunition. It's not possession of a firearm or a receiver.

And so it's possession of a firearm, and that's the same as 922(n). But the -- the -- the critical difference is, in 922(g), you have to have a prior conviction, and in 922(n), you do not. And so that's the -- the difference between the two. And that's why 922(n) is used in a lot of these cases.

The Ninth Circuit held that a risk disclosure can be misleading  simply because a company does not disclose that the specified triggering event for the risk had occurred in the past.

The Ninth Circuit's approach would trigger serious concerns about over-disclosure and fraud by hindsight, and this Court should reject it. Instead, the Court should adopt a similar approach to the one it took for statements of opinion in Omnicare. There, the Court held that statements of opinion were  ordinarily not actionable as false statements, but the Court recognized that a statement of opinion could be misleading based on an embedded representation about how the speaker formed the opinion. So too here, depending on the content of the statement, a forward-looking risk disclosure can be misleading based on an embedded premise about the current state of affairs. But just as a statement that the road may be flooded if it rains cannot be misleading simply because it rained yesterday, a typical risk disclosure cannot be misleading simply because the triggering event had occurred in the past. Under the correct approach, this case is an easy one. Meta's warnings that business harm could result in the event of data misuse did not imply that Meta had never previously suffered such misuse. But, in any event, the  initial misuse of the data had been publicly reported by the time Meta made the statements at  issue, and Respondents have abandoned any claim based on the continued misuse of the data. And  far from being virtually certain to cause a risk of harm to Meta's business, the initial misuse of the data did not result in any harm when it was publicly reported.

Alito, Jr.:  Mr. Shanmugam, let me ask you about the question that I asked Mr. Clement. I'm going to ask you about a hypothetical that may be similar to the one he gave you, but I'll try to make it a little bit more specific. Suppose the company has a statement in its prospectus that says, you know, our  --our -- our -- our -- our products are going to be -- are going to be used in the medical field, and we warn that if they're used in a way that's not consistent with FDA regulations, there could be serious adverse consequences. And then, at the time when the prospectus is issued, the company knows that that has happened. Now, if I read the prospectus, I would think, well, that's a warning, that's a risk, but that hasn't happened yet. So what would you say about that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I'm -- I'm asking you what you would say about that.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that's -- that's my question, what you would say about that. I'm asking you to assume that there is no other disclosure. That's the only disclosure. Now, if I read that, I would think, well, that's a warning, but it hasn't happened yet. Now, if the company knows that it has happened, I think it's arguable that the company is -- is engaging in a fraudulent scheme. And so I don't understand why you would say that that's not actionable.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So let me change it a little bit. So the company says, you know, there are all sorts of things that could go wrong with the -- with the -- with the product, and, you know, it's -- it's -- it's possible that, you know, a meteor could hit the factory. Now, if the company knows that, in fact, a meteor has hit the factory, then I would think that that would be a fraud.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So, if -- if the company knows that it has happened, then it's actionable. So, if the company knows that it has not happened, then it's not actionable?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So, if the company knows that it has not happened, it's not actionable?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Okay. So it depends on what the company knows?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  But the company  -- the company doesn't know whether the meteor has hit the factory or not?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I don't know how the company could not know whether a meteor had hit the factory.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Well, that's my question. I mean, I -- I don't know how you can separate the two things. You can't say that it's not actionable if the company doesn't know that it hasn't happened, but it is actionable if the company knows that it has happened. I mean, it's either happened or it hasn't happened.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I understand that. But, if it hasn't happened, then it's not actionable. And if it has happened, then it's actionable. So it depends on what the company knows?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that's what I'm asking you. I mean, the company knows that it hasn't happened or the company knows that it has happened. I don't know how the company can be in some middle position.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that's a -- that's a different question. I mean, that's a question of what the company knows, but what is the test?  Is the test what the company knows or is the test whether, in fact, it has happened or not happened?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that's not my question. My question is, is it -- is it -- is it -- is the test whether, in fact, it has happened or whether the company knows that it has happened?  That's my question.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I don't understand how the company can be in a position where it doesn't know whether it has happened or not happened. I really don't understand that.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  No, no, no. I understand that. That's a different question. I'm asking you to assume that the company doesn't know whether it's happened or not happened, and then you have to separate the two things. Has it happened?  Yes or no. The company doesn't know. And yet you're saying it's not actionable if it hasn't happened, but it is actionable if it has happened. I don't understand how you can separate those two things.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me ask it one more time. The company doesn't know whether it has happened. Is it actionable or not?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Sotomayor?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Just to be clear, you're saying that if it's happened, it's not actionable?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  If it's happened, it's not actionable?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if it's happened, it's not actionable, meaning it's not misleading?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if it's happened, it's not actionable, but, if it hasn't happened, it's also not actionable?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Ah.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So it's only actionable if it's happened?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Ah.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So let me go back to the question that Justice Alito asked, which was, if it's happened, it's happened. It's not misleading. It's just a statement of fact. It's not misleading. It's just a statement of fact. You're now putting at issue whether it's happened or not because you're saying, if it's happened, it's not misleading, but, if it hasn't happened, it is misleading. So it's really not a question of whether it's happened or not. It's a question of what the speaker intended. Is that what you're saying?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Ah.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So now we're going to have to prove what was in the speaker's mind?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Ah, okay.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So you're going back to the half truth. If you say, I might get married tomorrow, that's a half truth if I've signed a ketubah today, correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why is this any different?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Ah.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's not what you started by saying. You started by saying, if it's happened, it's not misleading. And I thought that what you were saying, it's not misleading because it's a statement of fact, it either happened or it didn't happen, and, if it did, you're not liable.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So let's go to that, which is, if you say, I intend to get married tomorrow, and you sign a ketubah today, signing the ketubah today doesn't make your statement that you intend to get married tomorrow false, does it?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  It might make it misleading.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Ah.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Ah.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let me go to a second -- let me go to a second point, which is, isn't your whole argument that what you have to prove is that the company knew that the misuse was happening, that the company knew that the misuse was happening, and that it was material, that it was going to hurt the company's profits. Isn't that what you have to prove?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if you can't prove that, why should we rule in your favor?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if we -- if we accept your position that there has to be a statement, that there has to be an omission, that there has to be a half truth, that there has to be a materiality finding, why don't we just remand this case and let the court below decide whether it's pleaded adequately?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what you're asking us to do.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, I'm asking you to assume that we think there's a difference between the Ninth Circuit's position and yours, and if we think there is, why shouldn't we just remand it?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I know, but that's the issue before us.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what they did.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what they did. They said, if you're going to plead that there's a half truth, you have to plead it adequately. And I don't know that they got it right. I don't know that they got it wrong. But, if we think that there is a difference between the two positions, why don't we just remand it and let them decide it?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, they did say that, but they didn't have the benefit of your briefs.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  I'd like to take you back to the Chief Justice's question, which is, you know, the Chief Justice said, well, we're not really talking about the general statement. We're talking about a specific statement, and the specific statement is that the company is going to do X. And, you know, the question is, well, if the company is not going to do X, if the company is going to do Y, is that a misleading statement?  And -- and I guess what I want to ask you is, why isn't that a misleading statement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I guess what I want to ask you is, why isn't that a misleading statement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  No, no, no. I -- I understand that you think that there are some statements that are not misleading. But I'm just asking you, why isn't this one?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I think it's a little bit different. I mean, I think that that's a kind of, you know, we're going to do X, but, you know, this could change, we could change our minds, all of that. And -- and so that -- that's a little bit different. But, if you just said, we're going to do X, we're going to do X, and then it turns out that you're not going to do X, that you're going to do Y, why isn't that a misleading statement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I guess I'm just not really understanding that, that it's not a statement about what you're going to do. It's a statement about what you're going to do. And then you do something different. And so why isn't that a misleading statement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I think that that's exactly the point. You're saying, if we think that the company is going to do X, we're going to do X, we're going to do X, and then it turns out that they're not going to do X, that they're going to do Y, that that's not a misleading statement.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I guess I'm just not understanding that. I mean, if you say, we're going to do X, and then you do Y, that's not a misleading statement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, what -- what -- what is the difference between that and this?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, that's a very different statement. That's a statement that says we're going to do X, but we might do Y. And, you know, that's a different statement. But, if you just say, we're going to do X, and then you do Y, why isn't that a misleading statement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  I -- I guess I'm just not understanding. I mean, you're saying we're going to do X, and then you do Y. Why isn't that a misleading statement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I guess I just don't understand. If you say we're going to do X, and then you do Y, that's not a misleading statement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  So you're saying that there's no difference between saying, we're going to do X, and saying, we're going to do X, but we might do Y?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  So that's a different statement. That's a different statement.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, that's not what we're talking about here. We're talking about a statement that says we're going to do X.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about a statement that says we're going to do X, and then the company does Y.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I guess I'm just not understanding why it's not a misleading statement.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, that's a different question, right?  I mean, that's a question of materiality, and there's all kinds of ways of getting at materiality, but that's a different question. I'm just asking you, why isn't it a misleading statement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, that's not the question that I'm asking.

Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I'd like to return to the Chief Justice's question about the difference between your test and the Ninth Circuit's. And you indicated that you agree with the Ninth Circuit that a purely forward-looking statement can be misleading if it's based on a material misstatement of historical fact. And I -- I guess I want to explore that a little bit further. Do you agree that that's true even if the historical fact is not itself a material omission","cleaned":"        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Mr. Shanmugam, let me ask you about the question that I asked Mr. Clement. I'm going to ask you about a hypothetical that may be similar to the one he gave you, but I'll try to make it a little bit more specific. Suppose the company has a statement in its prospectus that says, you know, our  --our -- our -- our -- our products are going to be -- are going to be used in the medical field, and we warn that if they're used in a way that's not consistent with FDA regulations, there could be serious adverse consequences. And then, at the time when the prospectus is issued, the company knows that that has happened. Now, if I read the prospectus, I would think, well, that's a warning, that's a risk, but that hasn't happened yet. So what would you say about that?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I'm -- I'm asking you what you would say about that.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that's -- that's my question, what you would say about that. I'm asking you to assume that there is no other disclosure. That's the only disclosure. Now, if I read that, I would think, well, that's a warning, but it hasn't happened yet. Now, if the company knows that it has happened, I think it's arguable that the company is -- is engaging in a fraudulent scheme. And so I don't understand why you would say that that's not actionable.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So let me change it a little bit. So the company says, you know, there are all sorts of things that could go wrong with the -- with the -- with the product, and, you know, it's -- it's -- it's possible that, you know, a meteor could hit the factory. Now, if the company knows that, in fact, a meteor has hit the factory, then I would think that that would be a fraud.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So, if -- if the company knows that it has happened, then it's actionable. So, if the company knows that it has not happened, then it's not actionable?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So, if the company knows that it has not happened, it's not actionable?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Okay. So it depends on what the company knows?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  But the company  -- the company doesn't know whether the meteor has hit the factory or not?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I don't know how the company could not know whether a meteor had hit the factory.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Well, that's my question. I mean, I -- I don't know how you can separate the two things. You can't say that it's not actionable if the company doesn't know that it hasn't happened, but it is actionable if the company knows that it has happened. I mean, it's either happened or it hasn't happened.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I understand that. But, if it hasn't happened, then it's not actionable. And if it has happened, then it's actionable. So it depends on what the company knows?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that's what I'm asking you. I mean, the company knows that it hasn't happened or the company knows that it has happened. I don't know how the company can be in some middle position.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that's a -- that's a different question. I mean, that's a question of what the company knows, but what is the test?  Is the test what the company knows or is the test whether, in fact, it has happened or not happened?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that's not my question. My question is, is it -- is it -- is it -- is the test whether, in fact, it has happened or whether the company knows that it has happened?  That's my question.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I don't understand how the company can be in a position where it doesn't know whether it has happened or not happened. I really don't understand that.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  No, no, no. I understand that. That's a different question. I'm asking you to assume that the company doesn't know whether it's happened or not happened, and then you have to separate the two things. Has it happened?  Yes or no. The company doesn't know. And yet you're saying it's not actionable if it hasn't happened, but it is actionable if it has happened. I don't understand how you can separate those two things.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me ask it one more time. The company doesn't know whether it has happened. Is it actionable or not?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Sotomayor?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Just to be clear, you're saying that if it's happened, it's not actionable?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  If it's happened, it's not actionable?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if it's happened, it's not actionable, meaning it's not misleading?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if it's happened, it's not actionable, but, if it hasn't happened, it's also not actionable?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Ah.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So it's only actionable if it's happened?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Ah.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So let me go back to the question that Justice Alito asked, which was, if it's happened, it's happened. It's not misleading. It's just a statement of fact. It's not misleading. It's just a statement of fact. You're now putting at issue whether it's happened or not because you're saying, if it's happened, it's not misleading, but, if it hasn't happened, it is misleading. So it's really not a question of whether it's happened or not. It's a question of what the speaker intended. Is that what you're saying?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Ah.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So now we're going to have to prove what was in the speaker's mind?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Ah, okay.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So you're going back to the half truth. If you say, I might get married tomorrow, that's a half truth if I've signed a ketubah today, correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So why is this any different?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Ah.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But that's not what you started by saying. You started by saying, if it's happened, it's not misleading. And I thought that what you were saying, it's not misleading because it's a statement of fact, it either happened or it didn't happen, and, if it did, you're not liable.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So let's go to that, which is, if you say, I intend to get married tomorrow, and you sign a ketubah today, signing the ketubah today doesn't make your statement that you intend to get married tomorrow false, does it?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  It might make it misleading.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Ah.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Ah.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let me go to a second -- let me go to a second point, which is, isn't your whole argument that what you have to prove is that the company knew that the misuse was happening, that the company knew that the misuse was happening, and that it was material, that it was going to hurt the company's profits. Isn't that what you have to prove?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if you can't prove that, why should we rule in your favor?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, if we -- if we accept your position that there has to be a statement, that there has to be an omission, that there has to be a half truth, that there has to be a materiality finding, why don't we just remand this case and let the court below decide whether it's pleaded adequately?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what you're asking us to do.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, I'm asking you to assume that we think there's a difference between the Ninth Circuit's position and yours, and if we think there is, why shouldn't we just remand it?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I know, but that's the issue before us.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what they did.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what they did. They said, if you're going to plead that there's a half truth, you have to plead it adequately. And I don't know that they got it right. I don't know that they got it wrong. But, if we think that there is a difference between the two positions, why don't we just remand it and let them decide it?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, they did say that, but they didn't have the benefit of your briefs.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Kagan?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  I'd like to take you back to the Chief Justice's question, which is, you know, the Chief Justice said, well, we're not really talking about the general statement. We're talking about a specific statement, and the specific statement is that the company is going to do X. And, you know, the question is, well, if the company is not going to do X, if the company is going to do Y, is that a misleading statement?  And -- and I guess what I want to ask you is, why isn't that a misleading statement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I guess what I want to ask you is, why isn't that a misleading statement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  No, no, no. I -- I understand that you think that there are some statements that are not misleading. But I'm just asking you, why isn't this one?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I think it's a little bit different. I mean, I think that that's a kind of, you know, we're going to do X, but, you know, this could change, we could change our minds, all of that. And -- and so that -- that's a little bit different. But, if you just said, we're going to do X, we're going to do X, and then it turns out that you're not going to do X, that you're going to do Y, why isn't that a misleading statement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I guess I'm just not really understanding that, that it's not a statement about what you're going to do. It's a statement about what you're going to do. And then you do something different. And so why isn't that a misleading statement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I think that that's exactly the point. You're saying, if we think that the company is going to do X, we're going to do X, we're going to do X, and then it turns out that they're not going to do X, that they're going to do Y, that that's not a misleading statement.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I guess I'm just not understanding that. I mean, if you say, we're going to do X, and then you do Y, that's not a misleading statement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, what -- what -- what is the difference between that and this?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, that's a very different statement. That's a statement that says we're going to do X, but we might do Y. And, you know, that's a different statement. But, if you just say, we're going to do X, and then you do Y, why isn't that a misleading statement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  I -- I guess I'm just not understanding. I mean, you're saying we're going to do X, and then you do Y. Why isn't that a misleading statement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I guess I just don't understand. If you say we're going to do X, and then you do Y, that's not a misleading statement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  So you're saying that there's no difference between saying, we're going to do X, and saying, we're going to do X, but we might do Y?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  So that's a different statement. That's a different statement.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, that's not what we're talking about here. We're talking about a statement that says we're going to do X.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about a statement that says we're going to do X, and then the company does Y.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I guess I'm just not understanding why it's not a misleading statement.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, that's a different question, right?  I mean, that's a question of materiality, and there's all kinds of ways of getting at materiality, but that's a different question. I'm just asking you, why isn't it a misleading statement?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, that's not the question that I'm asking.

I -- I understand that you think that there are some statements that are not misleading. But I'm just asking you, why isn't this one?<\/text>\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what they did.<\/text>\", \"Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that's a -- that's a different question. I mean, that's a question of what the company knows, but what is the test?  Is the test what the company knows or is the test whether, in fact, it has happened or not happened?<\/text>\", \"Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right.

I'm just saying, if you say we're going to do X and then you do Y, isn't that a misleading statement?<\/text>\", \"Justice Elena Kagan:  I'd like to take you back to the Chief Justice's question, which is, you know, the Chief Justice said, well, we're not really talking about the general statement. We're talking about a specific statement, and the specific statement is that the company is going to do X. And, you know, the question is, well, if the company is not going to do X, if the company is going to do Y, is that a misleading statement?  And -- and I guess what I want to ask you is, why isn't that a misleading statement?<\/text>\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So let me go back to the question that Justice Alito asked, which was, if it's happened, it's happened. It's not misleading. It's just a statement of fact. It's not misleading. It's just a statement of fact. You're now putting at issue whether it's happened or not because you're saying, if it's happened, it's not misleading, but, if it hasn't happened, it is misleading. So it's really not a question of whether it's happened or not. It's a question of what the speaker intended. Is that what you're saying?<\/text>\", \"Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Mr. Shanmugam, let me ask you about the question that I asked Mr. Clement. I'm going to ask you about a hypothetical that may be similar to the one he gave you, but I'll try to make it a little bit more specific. Suppose the company has a statement in its prospectus that says, you know, our  --our -- our -- our -- our products are going to be -- are going to be used in the medical field, and we warn that if they're used in a way that's not consistent with FDA regulations, there could be serious adverse consequences. And then, at the time when the prospectus is issued, the company knows that that has happened. Now, if I read the prospectus, I would think, well, that's a warning, that's a risk, but that hasn't happened yet. So what would you say about that?<\/text>\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  If it's happened, it's not actionable?<\/text>\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Ah.<\/text>\", \"Justice Elena Kagan:  I -- I guess I'm just not understanding. I mean, you're saying we're going to do X, and then you do Y. Why isn't that a misleading statement?<\/text>\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  It might make it misleading.<\/text>\", \"Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Well, that's my question. I mean, I -- I don't know how you can separate the two things. You can't say that it's not actionable if the company doesn't know that it hasn't happened, but it is actionable if the company knows that it has happened. I mean, it's either happened or it hasn't happened.<\/text>\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, that's what you're asking us to do.<\/text>\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, I'm asking you to assume that we think there's a difference between the Ninth Circuit's position and yours, and if we think there is, why shouldn't we just remand it?<\/text>\", \"Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  No, no, no. I understand that. That's a different question. I'm asking you to assume that the company doesn't know whether it's happened or not happened, and then you have to separate the two things. Has it happened?  Yes or no. The company doesn't know. And yet you're saying it's not actionable if it hasn't happened, but it is actionable if it has happened. I don't understand how you can separate those two things.<\/text>\", \"Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I guess I'm just not really understanding that, that it's not a statement about what you're going to do.

Alito, Jr.\n        Opening Statement: <speaker>Kevin K. Russell<\/speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start by making clear our position. First, as to the actual question presented, we agree that a risk disclosure is not misleading because it omits disclosure of an event that is immaterial because it risks no  business harm. The Ninth Circuit did not hold otherwise. Second, we agree that in addition to proving materiality, plaintiffs must also show  that the risk statement implies that the omitted event did not occur. We don't claim that every risk statement includes that implication. Our position is simply that they can and frequently do, and that ultimately depends on the facts and context of each case. Third, for that reason, the Court should reject Facebook's categorical rule that Item 105 statements are always agnostic about whether the risk has transpired in the past. Facebook admits that if a student tells his parents that there's a risk he may fail an exam when he's already done so, that is misleading because it implies it's impossible that he won't when that isn't true. The same is true of many risk factor statements, including the ones at issue in this case stating that the  -- describing an improper disclosure of user data as a hypothetical risk implied that it was possible it wouldn't occur. And that wasn't  possible because it already had. This does not mean that issuers must disclose every material occurrence of a risk. They simply must say enough to remove the false impression that the omitted event has not yet materialized, something they generally can do, as Facebook did here with respect to hacking, by simply acknowledging that the risk has materialized in the past. Finally, the Ninth Circuit did not adopt any contrary categorical rule. The Court did not discuss whether these particular statements were agnostic about the past because Facebook never argued that they were. It elected instead to argue only that the warned-of risks had not transpired because it viewed the warned -of risks as speaking only to hacking events and business harm. Because Facebook does not challenge the Ninth Circuit's fact-bound rejection of those claims in this Court, this Court should provide any necessary guidance for future cases in the course of affirming the judgment.

Alito, Jr.:  Counsel, I have a lot of questions, but I want to start with one about the way in which you have just characterized the question on which you agree with Facebook. You said that a risk disclosure is not misleading because it omits disclosure of an event that is immaterial because it risks no business harm. Now, if that's the standard, why do you have to go any further?  Why is it necessary to show that the risk statement implies that the event did not occur in the past?  If the statement would not be misleading without the implication that the event did not occur in the past, then the omission of the event must be immaterial. So what do you have to show beyond that? <\/START_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Kevin K. Russell:  Well, we have to show that it would be misleading. And that's what the statement  --<\/START_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, you've already said that it would be misleading if it would be misleading without the implication that the event didn't occur in the past. So you've already shown that it's misleading. <\/START_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Kevin K. Russell:  I don't think that's right, Justice Alito. I think the -- the question is whether it's misleading to say there's a risk that something will happen. And if you say that and it's not true, that's misleading. <\/START_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Okay. So you say there's a risk that something will happen, but it's already happened, and you don't say that. So you're saying there's a risk that something will happen in the future when it's already happened in the past. That's misleading. But you're saying it's not misleading if it doesn't risk business harm. So what do you have to show beyond that? <\/START_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Kevin K. Russell:  Well, what we have to show is that it's misleading. And I think, if you say there's a risk that something will happen when it's already happened, that is misleading. And the reason why is that that statement is saying there's a risk that it will happen. <\/START_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So you've shown that it's misleading. And you're saying that it's not misleading if it doesn't risk business harm.

Russell:  I think it's misleading to say there's a risk that something will happen when it's already happened. And the reason why is that that statement is saying there's a risk that it will happen.

It said that if you're talking about a risk of future data breaches and you've already had a data breach, that's misleading.

A claimant  has to seek relief from the Secretary before suing the Secretary. The claimant never  -- the Secretary never has to seek relief from the claimant for anything and never has any reason to exhaust any remedy. Respondent also emphasizes that Alabama's law is jurisdictional. But this Court has held that a state cannot avoid preemption by defining the jurisdiction of state courts to exclude cases in which the defendant asserts an affirmative defense that this Court has held is not available. And that's exactly what happened in this case. Finally and at a minimum, the Alabama statute is preempted as applied to this case in which the Alabama Supreme Court reached the Kafkaesque conclusion that Petitioners could not challenge their inability to exhaust precisely because of their inability to exhaust.

Nothing in 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 makes clear that it was meant to preempt neutral jurisdictional rules like the one at issue here. Petitioners' reliance on Patsy ignores the key difference between exhaustion rules created by Congress and exhaustion doctrines crafted by courts. The former may preempt, but the latter do not. They are judge-made timing rules, like ripeness and abstention, that do not add elements to a federal right but merely determine when a federal court is going to hear it. This Court's ripeness and abstention holdings do not apply to state courts. Nor does  its determination that federal courts generally should not send 1983 plaintiffs to the states. Precedent confirms that 1983 does not contain a categorical no -exhaustion element. In Johnson v. Fankell, the Court did not require immediate appellate review of a 1983 defense. In Ohio Civil Rights Commission v. Dayton Christian Schools from 1986, this Court applied Younger abstention to force a 1983 plaintiff back into state agency proceedings. These decisions show that deferring consideration of a federal right does not necessarily alter or defeat it. Thus, while some notice of claims rules, like the one in Felder, are preempted as obstacles to adjudication and liability, agency review is typically a means of adjudication and does not inherently conflict with 1983's remedial purpose. But, even if immediate judicial consideration were an unwritten element of 1983,  neutral jurisdictional rules like Alabama's are still a valid excuse for declining jurisdiction. Reading 1983 to preempt such laws would raise serious constitutional questions that are best avoided.

But why is that the relevant principle?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me switch to a different subject. What is the difference between the argument that you're making and the argument that was made in McKesson?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So the  -- the difference is that the state is not trying to regulate the conduct of a federal officer. Is that the difference?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So the state could do that, right?  The state could say we're going to recognize a tort, it's called negligent infliction of emotional distress, and it's a tort that can be committed only by a federal officer, and you can recover only $10, and that would not be preempted?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me ask you one more question, and that concerns the text of 1983. As I read it, it says that every person who, under color of law, shall deprive any  -- any citizen of any right secured by the Constitution and laws shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law. So the right that is created by 1983 is the right to sue for a violation of the Constitution or a federal law. And you say, well, this is not the right that's created by 1983, this is the right created by the Fourteenth Amendment. But why isn't the right created by 1983 the right to sue for a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I mean, it's a right to sue for a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Why isn't that the right that is created by 1983?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I understand that, but I'm talking about the right to sue. Isn't the right to sue for a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment the right that is created by 1983?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I thought that the right that is created by 1983 is the right to sue for a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Now maybe that's not right. Maybe the right that is created by 1983 is the right to sue for a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and to recover only nominal damages. Maybe that's the right that is created by 1983, but that's not what the statute says. So that seems to be a problem for you.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right.

So the  -- the difference is that the state is not trying to regulate the conduct of a federal officer. Is that the difference?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So the state could do that, right?

As I read it, it says that every person who, under color of law, shall deprive any  -- any citizen of any right secured by the Constitution and laws shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law. So the right that is created by 1983 is the right to sue for a violation of the Constitution or a federal law.

But why isn't the right created by 1983 the right to sue for a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A.

Maybe the right that is created by 1983 is the right to sue for a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and to recover only nominal damages.

Respondents also argue that overtime rights aren't waivable. But waivability and standards of proof are unrelated and don't go hand in hand. Waivability goes to who owns the right, the government or the individual, and the standard of proof goes to how hard it is to prove that the right attaches in the first place.

Alito, Jr.:  Well, what do you understand to be the -- the difference between the clear and convincing evidence standard and the preponderance of the evidence standard?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  I think it's a very high standard. It's a very high standard that I think is met only in the rarest of cases. And the reason why we think it's so high is because, in the criminal context, it's a very high standard. And the only other context where it's applied is in a deportation context, which is a very high standard, and also in the -- in the patent context, which is a very high standard. So I think it's -- it's the highest of the high. And I think, if you look at the lower courts, they've all come to the same conclusion, that it's a very high standard, and that's why it's so rarely met. And that's why, in the criminal context, it's the highest of the high and it's very rarely met.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, what do lower courts say about the difference between the two?  Do they say anything?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  They say -- they say that it's a higher standard. And I think the way they say it is that it's -- it's the higher -- it's a higher quantum of proof. It's a higher quantum of evidence. It's a higher quantum of persuasion. And I think the only way you can describe it is just that it's a very high standard, and it's very rarely met. And I think that's why you see it in the deportation context, in the patent context, and in the criminal context.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So, if you -- if you -- if you can't quantify it, how do you think the district court should explain the difference between the two to the jury?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  I think that the district court should just say it's a higher standard and that it's very rarely met. And I think that's what the district court said here, and I think that's what the jury was instructed, and I think that's why they found --<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, if it's -- if it's a higher standard, does that mean that it's more likely than not that the person is liable, but it's not clear and convincing that the person is liable?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  I think it means that the person is more likely than not to be liable, but it's not clear and convincing. And I think that's what the jury was instructed here, and that's why the jury found that it was more likely than not that the company was liable, but it wasn't clear and convincing. And I think that's why the district court entered judgment for the Respondent.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So let me ask you this question. Suppose that a district court said to a jury, look, you have to find by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is liable. But what that means is that it has to be a little bit more than 50 percent likely that the defendant is liable. Would that be error?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  I mean, I think that if you're going to define \"clear and convincing\" as a little bit more than 50 percent, I think you're going to be -- I mean, I think it's going to be a little bit higher than that. But I think, if you're going to define it as a little bit more than 50 percent, I think you're going to be in a world of hurt because you're going to be -- you're going to be saying that it's not really clear and convincing. It's just a little bit more than 50 percent. I think, if you're going to define it as a little bit more than 50 percent, you're going to have to say that that's the preponderance standard.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So that would be error. So then the -- the district court has to say something more than that. What more does the district court have to say?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  I think the district court has to say that it's a higher standard, that it's a higher quantum of proof, that it's a higher quantum of evidence, that it's a higher quantum of persuasion, and that it's very rarely met.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me ask you one -- one more related question, and that is, what if the district court said this:  Look, you have to find by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is liable, but that means that you have to be 75 percent sure that the defendant is liable. Would that be error?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  I mean, I think, if you're going to put a number on it, I think you're going to have to put a higher number on it. I mean, I think 75 percent is a little low. I mean, I think it's going to have to be something higher than that. But, if you're going to put a number on it, I think it's going to have to be higher than 75 percent.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So that would be error. How about 85 percent?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  I think 85 percent is probably fine. I mean, I think you could probably even put 80 percent on it, but I think you're going to have to put a number that's pretty high.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. How are district judges supposed to know all this?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  Well, I think they're supposed to know it because this Court has been very clear in its opinions that clear and convincing evidence is the highest of the high. And I think that's why we've seen it in the rarest of cases, and I think that's why we've seen it in deportation cases, in patent cases, and in criminal cases.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me go on to a different -- a different point. You said that the difference between the preponderance standard and the clear and convincing standard is not that big of a deal. So, if that's the case, why should we bother reviewing this issue?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  Well, I think, if you look at the lower court opinions, they've all come to the same conclusion that the difference is not that big of a deal, but it is a difference. And I think, if you look at the cases, it's a difference that matters. I mean, it's a difference that matters in the criminal context. It's a difference that matters in the deportation context.

Number two, you mentioned the criminal context, and you said that that's why it's so high. But, in the criminal context, it's death penalty cases that generally have the 75 percent instruction, correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S.

And I think, if you look at the lower courts, they've all come to the same conclusion, that the difference between the two is not that great.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But we're not talking about the difference between the two. We're talking about what standard Congress had in mind when it passed this act, correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S.

So tell me why, if it's not the common law, what standard do we presume Congress had in mind?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S.

And I think that if you look at the lower court opinions, they've all come to the same conclusion, that it's a very high standard, and it's very rarely met.

You see it in deportation cases, in patent cases, and in criminal cases.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what do we do with the fact that, at the time that this act was passed, most states had a clear and convincing standard?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S.

Blatt:  Because I think that Congress would have been presuming that the common law standard would have applied, which is the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, and that's the standard that this Court has always applied. And I think that's the standard that's applied in all civil cases. And I think that's the standard that should apply here.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Thank you, counsel.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G.

You know, you said that the difference is not that great. And I guess I'm wondering why you would say that. I mean, the reason we have different standards of proof is because they mean different things, and we think that it's appropriate to have different standards of proof in different contexts. And the clear-and-convincing standard is a very high standard of proof. It's a standard of proof that we usually reserve for cases involving fraud or for cases involving loss of liberty. And the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard is a lower standard of proof, and it's a standard of proof that we usually apply in the mine run of cases. So why would you say that there's not that great a difference between the two?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  So I think there's not that great a difference between the two because I think that the clear-and-convincing standard is a very high standard of proof, but it's not a different standard of proof. It's a higher quantum of proof, but it's not a different standard of proof. And I think that's why you see it in the lower court opinions. And I think that's why it's very rarely met.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Well, I -- I guess I don't understand that. I mean, I think that we have different standards of proof because we think that they mean different things. And we think that they mean different things because we want juries to do different things in different contexts. And in some contexts, we think that the -- the mine run standard is appropriate, and in other contexts, we think that a higher standard is appropriate. So why would you say that the difference is not that great?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  I think the difference is not that great because I think that the lower courts have all said that it's not that great. And I think that it's not that great because it's not a different standard of proof. It's a higher quantum of proof, but it's not a different standard of proof. And I think that's why you see it in the lower court opinions. And I think that's why you see it in the rarest of cases. You see it in deportation cases, in patent cases, and in criminal cases. And I think that's why it's very rarely met.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Elena Kagan:  Thank you, Ms. Blatt.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Gorsuch?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  I just wanted to follow up on Justice Kagan's questions. I -- I -- I guess I'm struggling to understand what a higher quantum of proof means if it's not a different standard of proof.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  So I think what it means is that the -- the -- the clear-and-convincing standard is a higher quantum of proof, but it's not a different standard of proof. And I think that's why you see it in the lower court opinions.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Well, I guess what I want to hear is how is it a higher quantum of proof if it's not a different standard of proof?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  Because it's a higher quantum of proof, but it's not a different standard of proof. And I think that's why you see it in the lower court opinions. And I think that's why you see it in the rarest of cases. You see it in deportation cases, in patent cases, and in criminal cases. And I think that's why it's very rarely met.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  Well, I guess what I want to hear is, is there a percentage likelihood associated with these things?  Is it 51 or whatever the district court said here, 75 percent?  Is it 90 percent?  Is it 95 percent?  Is it 99 percent?  I -- I -- I guess I'm -- I'm -- I'm just curious what -- what -- what the quantum is that creates the difference if it's not a standard?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  So I think the quantum is that it's a higher quantum of proof. And I think that's why you see it in the lower court opinions. And I think that's why you see it in the rarest of cases. You see it in deportation cases, in patent cases, and in criminal cases. And I think that's why it's very rarely met.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Neil Gorsuch:  So -- so it","cleaned":"        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, what do you understand to be the -- the difference between the clear and convincing evidence standard and the preponderance of the evidence standard?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  I think it's a very high standard. It's a very high standard that I think is met only in the rarest of cases. And the reason why we think it's so high is because, in the criminal context, it's a very high standard. And the only other context where it's applied is in a deportation context, which is a very high standard, and also in the -- in the patent context, which is a very high standard. So I think it's -- it's the highest of the high. And I think, if you look at the lower courts, they've all come to the same conclusion, that it's a very high standard, and that's why it's so rarely met. And that's why, in the criminal context, it's the highest of the high and it's very rarely met.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, what do lower courts say about the difference between the two?  Do they say anything?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  They say -- they say that it's a higher standard. And I think the way they say it is that it's -- it's the higher -- it's a higher quantum of proof. It's a higher quantum of evidence. It's a higher quantum of persuasion. And I think the only way you can describe it is just that it's a very high standard, and it's very rarely met. And I think that's why you see it in the deportation context, in the patent context, and in the criminal context.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So, if you -- if you -- if you can't quantify it, how do you think the district court should explain the difference between the two to the jury?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  I think that the district court should just say it's a higher standard and that it's very rarely met. And I think that's what the district court said here, and I think that's what the jury was instructed, and I think that's why they found --<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, if it's -- if it's a higher standard, does that mean that it's more likely than not that the person is liable, but it's not clear and convincing that the person is liable?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  I think it means that the person is more likely than not to be liable, but it's not clear and convincing. And I think that's what the jury was instructed here, and that's why the jury found that it was more likely than not that the company was liable, but it wasn't clear and convincing. And I think that's why the district court entered judgment for the Respondent.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So let me ask you this question. Suppose that a district court said to a jury, look, you have to find by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is liable. But what that means is that it has to be a little bit more than 50 percent likely that the defendant is liable. Would that be error?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  I mean, I think that if you're going to define \"clear and convincing\" as a little bit more than 50 percent, I think you're going to be -- I mean, I think it's going to be a little bit higher than that. But I think, if you're going to define it as a little bit more than 50 percent, I think you're going to be in a world of hurt because you're going to be -- you're going to be saying that it's not really clear and convincing. It's just a little bit more than 50 percent. I think, if you're going to define it as a little bit more than 50 percent, you're going to have to say that that's the preponderance standard.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So that would be error. So then the -- the district court has to say something more than that. What more does the district court have to say?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  I think the district court has to say that it's a higher standard, that it's a higher quantum of proof, that it's a higher quantum of evidence, that it's a higher quantum of persuasion, and that it's very rarely met.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me ask you one -- one more related question, and that is, what if the district court said this:  Look, you have to find by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is liable, but that means that you have to be 75 percent sure that the defendant is liable. Would that be error?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  I mean, I think, if you're going to put a number on it, I think you're going to have to put a higher number on it. I mean, I think 75 percent is a little low. I mean, I think it's going to have to be something higher than that. But, if you're going to put a number on it, I think it's going to have to be higher than 75 percent.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So that would be error. How about 85 percent?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  I think 85 percent is probably fine. I mean, I think you could probably even put 80 percent on it, but I think you're going to have to put a number that's pretty high.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. How are district judges supposed to know all this?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  Well, I think they're supposed to know it because this Court has been very clear in its opinions that clear and convincing evidence is the highest of the high. And I think that's why we've seen it in the rarest of cases, and I think that's why we've seen it in deportation cases, in patent cases, and in criminal cases.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me go on to a different -- a different point. You said that the difference between the preponderance standard and the clear and convincing standard is not that big of a deal. So, if that's the case, why should we bother reviewing this issue?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S. Blatt:  Well, I think, if you look at the lower court opinions, they've all come to the same conclusion that the difference is not that big of a deal, but it is a difference. And I think, if you look at the cases, it's a difference that matters. I mean, it's a difference that matters in the criminal context. It's a difference that matters in the deportation context. And it's a difference that matters in the patent context.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G.

Number two, you mentioned the criminal context, and you said that that's why it's so high.

And I think, in the criminal context, it's -- it's a -- it's a very high standard, and it's very rarely met.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, just so I'm clear, in the criminal context, the clear and convincing standard is not generally applied, correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Lisa S.

Alito, Jr.:  Well, what do you understand to be the -- the difference between the clear and convincing evidence standard and the preponderance of the evidence standard?<\/text>","Lisa S. Blatt:  I think it's a very high standard. It's a very high standard that I think is met only in the rarest of cases. And the reason why we think it's so high is because, in the criminal context, it's a very high standard. And the only other context where it's applied is in a deportation context, which is a very high standard, and also in the -- in the patent context, which is a very high standard. So I think it's -- it's the highest of the high. And I think, if you look at the lower courts, they've all come to the same conclusion, that it's a very high standard, and that's why it's so rarely met. And that's why, in the criminal context, it's the highest of the high and it's very rarely met.<\/text>","Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, what do lower courts say about the difference between the two?  Do they say anything?<\/text>","Lisa S. Blatt:  They say -- they say that it's a higher standard. And I think the way they say it is that it's -- it's the higher -- it's a higher quantum of proof. It's a higher quantum of evidence. It's a higher quantum of persuasion. And I think the only way you can describe it is just that it's a very high standard, and it's very rarely met. And I think that's why you see it in the deportation context, in the patent context, and in the criminal context.<\/text>","Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So, if you -- if you -- if you can't quantify it, how do you think the district court should explain the difference between the two to the jury?<\/text>","Lisa S. Blatt:  I think that the district court should just say it's a higher standard and that it's very rarely met. And I think that's what the district court said here, and I think that's what the jury was instructed, and I think that's why they found --<\/text>","Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, if it's -- if it's a higher standard, does that mean that it's more likely than not that the person is liable, but it's not clear and convincing that the person is liable?<\/text>","Lisa S. Blatt:  I think it means that the person is more likely than not to be liable, but it's not clear and convincing. And I think that's what the jury was instructed here, and that's why the jury found that it was more likely than not that the company was liable, but it wasn't clear and convincing. And I think that's why the district court entered judgment for the Respondent.<\/text>","Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So let me ask you this question. Suppose that a district court said to a jury, look, you have to find by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is liable. But what that means is that it has to be a little bit more than 50 percent likely that the defendant is liable. Would that be error?<\/text>","Lisa S. Blatt:  I mean, I think that if you're going to define \"clear and convincing\" as a little bit more than 50 percent, I think you're going to be -- I mean, I think it's going to be a little bit higher than that. But I think, if you're going to define it as a little bit more than 50 percent, I think you're going to be in a world of hurt because you're going to be -- you're going to be saying that it's not really clear and convincing. It's just a little bit more than 50 percent. I think, if you're going to define it as a little bit more than 50 percent, you're going to have to say that that's the preponderance standard.<\/text>","Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So that would be error. So then the -- the district court has to say something more than that. What more does the district court have to say?<\/text>","Lisa S. Blatt:  I think the district court has to say that it's a higher standard, that it's a higher quantum of proof, that it's a higher quantum of evidence, that it's a higher quantum of persuasion, and that it's very rarely met.<\/text>","Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me ask you one -- one more related question, and that is, what if the district court said this:  Look, you have to find by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is liable, but that means that you have to be 75 percent sure that the defendant is liable. Would that be error?<\/text>","Lisa S. Blatt:  I mean, I think, if you're going to put a number on it, I think you're going to have to put a higher number on it. I mean, I think 75 percent is a little low. I mean, I think it's going to have to be something higher than that. But, if you're going to put a number on it, I think it's going to have to be higher than 75 percent.<\/text>","Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So that would be error. How about 85 percent?<\/text>","Lisa S. Blatt:  I think 85 percent is probably fine. I mean, I think you could probably even put 80 percent on it, but I think you're going to have to put a number that's pretty high.<\/text>","Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. How are district judges supposed to know all this?<\/text>","Lisa S. Blatt:  Well, I think they're supposed to know it because this Court has been very clear in its opinions that clear and convincing evidence is the highest of the high.

Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me go on to a different -- a different point. You said that the difference between the preponderance standard and the clear and convincing standard is not that big of a deal. So, if that's the case, why should we bother reviewing this issue?<\/text>","Lisa S. Blatt:  Well, I think, if you look at the lower court opinions, they've all come to the same conclusion that the difference is not that big of a deal, but it is a difference. And I think, if you look at the cases, it's a difference that matters. I mean, it's a difference that matters in the criminal context. It's a difference that matters in the deportation context.

Blatt:  We are not defending the 75 percent number.<\/text>","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. Number two, you mentioned the criminal context, and you said that that's why it's so high.

Blatt:  Correct.<\/text>","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. But you also said that the common law has no clear and convincing standard?<\/text>","Lisa S. Blatt:  Correct.<\/text>","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So what do we do with that?<\/text>","Lisa S. Blatt:  So I think the common law has no clear and convincing standard, but it does have a very high standard of proof, which is what this Court has said in Santos-Zacaria, which is that it's -- it's a very high standard of proof. And I think, if you look at the lower courts, they've all come to the same conclusion, that the difference between the two is not that great.<\/text>","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But we're not talking about the difference between the two.

You know, you said that the difference is not that great. And I guess I'm wondering why you would say that. I mean, the reason we have different standards of proof is because they mean different things, and we think that it's appropriate to have different standards of proof in different contexts. And the clear-and-convincing standard is a very high standard of proof. It's a standard of proof that we usually reserve for cases involving fraud or for cases involving loss of liberty.

Alito, Jr.:  Well, what do you understand to be the -- the difference between the clear and convincing evidence standard and the preponderance of the evidence standard?<\/text>\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right.

You rely on the -- the -- the rule that says that we presume that Congress legislates against the backdrop of the common law, correct?<\/text>\", \"Lisa S.

It's a very high standard that I think is met only in the rarest of cases. And the reason why we think it's so high is because, in the criminal context, it's a very high standard. And the only other context where it's applied is in a deportation context, which is a very high standard, and also in the -- in the patent context, which is a very high standard. So I think it's -- it's the highest of the high.

You know, you said that the difference is not that great. And I guess I'm wondering why you would say that. I mean, the reason we have different standards of proof is because they mean different things, and we think that it's appropriate to have different standards of proof in different contexts. And the clear-and-convincing standard is a very high standard of proof. It's a standard of proof that we usually reserve for cases involving fraud or for cases involving loss of liberty. And the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard is a lower standard of proof, and it's a standard of proof that we usually apply in the mine run of cases.

Ho<\/speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The False Claims Act, which casts its shadow over every aspect of the administrative state, has always been trained on guarding the public fisc. The FCA protects government funds by defining a claim as a request for money the government provides or that's presented to a government agent. As a result of political branch choices, E-rate reimbursement requests check neither box. The program could have been funded with public money and administered by a government agency, but the political branches chose private funding and a private administrator to prevent E-rate money from being used to mask budget shortfalls and to avoid the Government Corporation Control Act. The consequence of those choices is that E-rate reimbursement requests aren't FCA claims. First, the government doesn't provide any money in the E-rate program. Text, context, structure, and history all confirm that the government provides money for FCA purposes only if it supplies money from its own funds, putting  the public fisc at risk. That never happened here. The government doesn't provide money by making one private party pay another private party, and the government doesn't provide money by collecting debts owed to a private party and in which the government has no financial stake. Second, the program's private administrator, the Administrative Company, isn't a government agent. By design, it lacks power to bind the government, which in turn lacks control over what matters here:  grants of E-rate reimbursement requests. In fact, we know the company can't be a government agent because, if it were, it would violate the Government Corporation Control Act. Choices have consequences, and the choices made by the political branches to insulate the E-rate program from the public fisc foreclose applying the FCA.

As Justice Kagan's soup hypothetical, Justice Barrett's proctor hypothetical illustrate, when an entity like the government provides money through agents, we credit the principal in that situation. So, when Wisconsin Bell  receives money, claims money, from the E-rate program, we credit the government with providing it. FCC mandates also  determine carriers' obligations to contribute to the Universal Service Fund. Those mandates are how the government provided funds to this program, and  it doesn't matter that the government routed the funds directly from the carriers to the  Universal Service Fund instead of requiring an unnecessary detour through federal Treasury accounts because the False Claims Act's applicability doesn't turn on bookkeeping conventions, which is also a point Ms. Ho made, I think, quite well. The point is not exactly how did the money move through a bureaucracy, was it routed efficiently or less efficiently. The point is who is really making the money move, and it is the government. The government is the only relevant decision-maker at all stages of creating, funding, and then controlling the distributions from this program.

Alito, Jr.:  Well, what about a situation in which the government makes a contract with a private entity to build a dam, and the private entity hires a subcontractor, and the subcontractor is paid by the private entity?  So the subcontractor is paid by the private entity. Is that money that is provided by the government?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's a harder case. I think the difference is that in that case, the government has not mandated the relationship between the prime contractor and the subcontractor. So I think, in that case, the subcontractor would not have a claim because the government has not mandated the payment.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, the government has mandated the payment. The government says to the prime contractor, we want you to build this dam, and you have to pay your subcontractors. So, in that sense, the government has mandated the payment. But the subcontractor is paid by the prime contractor, not by the government.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I -- I think the distinction is that the government is not the one who is deciding that this subcontractor is the one who should be paid. It is the prime contractor. So I think that is a harder case. I think that's a case in which the subcontractor would not have a claim.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, why isn't this similar?  Why isn't this similar?  The government says to the administrator, we want you to administer this program, and you have to pay these people. And the administrator says, okay, I will do that. So the administrator is the one who pays them, not the government.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  Well, I think that the administrator is the one who pays them, but the administrator is doing so only because the government has mandated that it do so. And so I think, in that case, the government is the one who is making the decision to pay these entities. And I think that's the key distinction.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  But it's the administrator who writes the check. It's not the government that writes the check.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's true, but I think, in the case of the subcontractor, it's also true that the subcontractor is paid by the prime contractor, not by the government.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Right.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think that's why I think it's a harder case.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Right. But you think that's a harder case. So that means it's not a situation that is so clear that it can be disposed of on a motion to dismiss. It has to go to a jury.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think that's right, but I think that's a -- that's a feature of the False Claims Act generally, is that it's not always going to be clear whether something is false or not. But I think, here, the government is clearly the payer of these claims. And I think that's why the government itself has treated this as the government paying the claims since the beginning of the program.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Well, let me ask you a question about your test. So, if I understand your test, it turns on whether the government mandates the payment by the administrator. Is that right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's right, yes.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. What if the government says to the administrator, you have to pay these entities, but you have discretion to determine the amount that is paid to them?  Is that still the government's money?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  Yes, I think it is. I think, in that case, the government is still the one who is making the decision to pay the money, but it's delegating to the administrator the amount.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  What if the administrator has discretion to determine which entities are going to be paid?  Is that still the government's money?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think that's a harder case. I think, in that case, it's possible that the administrator is really the one who's making the decision. And so I think that's a case in which there may not be a claim.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So the degree of discretion that is -- that is conferred on the administrator determines whether this is the government's money or not the government's money?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's right, yes.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And what is the limit on the discretion that has to be conferred?  Is it a magic number?  Is it a percentage?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the -- the -- the question would be, is the government really the one making the decision or is the administrator really the one making the decision?  And I think, in this case, it's crystal-clear it's the government.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, it's crystal-clear in this case, but what's the general test?  How are we supposed to apply this test?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the general test is, is the government really the one making the decision?  And I think, here, the government is clearly the one making the decision. I think, in the case of the subcontractor, the government is not the one making the decision. And I think, in the case where the administrator has discretion to choose who's paid, that's a harder case. I think that's a case in which there may not be a claim, but I don't think the Court needs to get into that here.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  No, I know, but if we're going to write an opinion for the Court, we have to have some idea what the general test is.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think the general test is, is the government really the one making the decision?  And I think, in this case, it's crystal-clear the government is the one making the decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that's not very helpful. The government is the one making the decision to the same extent in the subcontractor situation as it is here. The government says to the prime contractor, you have to pay your subcontractors, and the government says to the administrator, you have to pay these entities. So, in both situations, the government is making the decision. But you say that in one situation it's the government's money and in the other situation it's not the government's money.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think the difference is that, in the case of the subcontractor, the government is not the one who's making the decision about which subcontractor is paid and how much. The government is simply saying to the prime contractor, you have to pay your subcontractors. But the government is not itself making the decision about which subcontractors to pay and how much. In this case, the government is the one making the decision about which entities to pay and how much.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me come back to one --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Thank you --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  -- one last -- oh, I'm sorry.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  -- thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  No, Chief.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Alito?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  I do have one last question. Let me come back to one last question about your friend on the other side's argument that this is not the government's money because it's not in the Treasury. You said that that's wrong, that it is in the Treasury, but it's not in the general revenues of the Treasury. Where is it in the Treasury?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So it's in the Treasury's bank account. The Treasury has a bank account, and this money is in the Treasury's bank account. It's just not in the general fund. It's in a segregated account.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Thank you.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Sotomayor?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  What's the source of the government's authority to collect these fees?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think the source of the government's authority to collect the fees is Section 254 of the Communications Act, which is 47 U.S.C. 254.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then what's the source of the authority to transfer those fees to the administrator to administer this program?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's also in the same statute, 254, which -- which creates the Universal Service Fund and requires the FCC to determine how to assess and collect the fees.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then you were making the point to Justice Alito that the administrator's just an agent of the government. Is that correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's correct.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then you were making the point that the government is the one making the decision, the ultimate decision, on who's going to be paid, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's correct.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then you were making the point that the government's the one who's making the decision on how much will be paid, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's correct.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then you were making the point that the government's the one who's making the decision on the rules that will govern the program, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's correct.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. And then, on the question of how much will be paid, the administrator, as I understand it, has the authority to determine what the discount will be for each entity, and that determines ultimately how much will be paid, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's right, although I think the FCC determines the category of entities that are eligible for discounts and the administrator only makes the determination as among entities within those categories.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Right. Okay. Thank you.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Barrett?  Justice Jackson?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  So I -- I guess I'm a little confused about the extent to which you're relying on common law. I mean, I hear you saying that the common law is what's relevant here, but then you also say that the common law is very flexible and that there's no one way to look at this. So what are we doing?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the common law is what the text points to. I think that's why the Court should look at the common law. And I think the common law tells you that when the government is the one making the decision to pay an entity, that is government money. And I think that's what the common law says, and that's why I think the Court should look to the common law.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  But the common law is very flexible, and so I guess I'm trying to understand, you know, what are we looking at?  I mean, are we looking at the common law of agency?  Are we looking at the common law of contract?  Are we looking at the common law of property?  I don't know.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think we're looking at the common law of agency and contract. I think that's the relevant common law. And I think the common law of agency and contract tells you that when the government is the one making the decision, that's government money.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  And is that the same common law that the government has relied on to say that this is not government money in other contexts?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the government has made inconsistent arguments, and I think it's made incorrect arguments in other contexts, but I think that's not a reason for this Court to follow those arguments.<\/START_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  All right. Let me ask you about the -- the amount of the recovery. So, if we -- if we agree with you that this is government money and the False Claims Act applies, I understand you to say that the -- the recovery is the amount that the -- the government would have paid, the full amount that the government would have paid to the person who was supposed to be paid, not the amount that the government paid to the person who shouldn't have been paid. Is that right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's right.<\/START_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  Okay. So --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's the -- the -- the -- the general principle, that the government is entitled to the amount it would have paid if the defendant had told the truth.<\/START_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  Right, right, right. So, in this case, that would be the amount that the government would have paid to the school if the school had been telling the truth, if the school had been eligible, is that right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's right.<\/START_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  And that's not the amount that the government paid to the provider, the -- the -- the -- the entity that shouldn't have been paid. So I guess I'm trying to understand why that is. If the point of the False Claims Act is to compensate the government for its losses, why isn't the amount of the recovery in this situation the amount that the government paid to the person who wasn't supposed to be paid?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the reason is that the defendant has prevented the government from learning the truth about the school, and so the government doesn't know whether the school would have been eligible or not. And so I think the right way to look at it is the government is entitled to the amount that it would have paid if the defendant had told the truth.<\/START_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  But doesn't the government have some burden to figure out whether or not the school was eligible?  I mean, you seem to suggest that the government doesn't have any role to play in this world of figuring out whether or not the school was eligible, and if the government had figured that out, it wouldn't have paid the service provider, it would have paid the school. So why isn't it fair to say that the amount that the government is owed is the amount that it paid to the service provider?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the reason is twofold. One is that the government has been prevented from learning the truth about the school. It doesn't know whether the school would have been eligible or not. And, two, the defendant has a burden to prove its defense by a preponderance of the evidence, and so it has the burden of coming forward and establishing that the school would not have been eligible.<\/START_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  All right. So, finally, let me just ask you, why is this case about the government's money?  I mean, I hear you, but this is a case about a private entity that was paid by another private entity for services that it performed. And so it would seem that the amount at issue is the amount that was paid by the private entity to the service provider, not the government's money. So why is this a False Claims Act case?<\/START_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think it's a False Claims Act case because the government is the one who's making the decision about who gets paid and how much, and so it is really the government's money. It's just the government has delegated to another entity the authority to write the check.<\/START_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  But the government isn't making the decision about who's going to get paid and how much in this situation. The government has said, if you're an eligible school, we will pay the -- the -- the -- the service provider on your behalf, but the government isn't involved in the decision-making as to who is eligible and which of the service providers are going to be paid.<\/START_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I disagree with that, Justice","cleaned":"        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, what about a situation in which the government makes a contract with a private entity to build a dam, and the private entity hires a subcontractor, and the subcontractor is paid by the private entity?  So the subcontractor is paid by the private entity. Is that money that is provided by the government?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's a harder case. I think the difference is that in that case, the government has not mandated the relationship between the prime contractor and the subcontractor. So I think, in that case, the subcontractor would not have a claim because the government has not mandated the payment.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, the government has mandated the payment. The government says to the prime contractor, we want you to build this dam, and you have to pay your subcontractors. So, in that sense, the government has mandated the payment. But the subcontractor is paid by the prime contractor, not by the government.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I -- I think the distinction is that the government is not the one who is deciding that this subcontractor is the one who should be paid. It is the prime contractor. So I think that is a harder case. I think that's a case in which the subcontractor would not have a claim.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, why isn't this similar?  Why isn't this similar?  The government says to the administrator, we want you to administer this program, and you have to pay these people. And the administrator says, okay, I will do that. So the administrator is the one who pays them, not the government.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  Well, I think that the administrator is the one who pays them, but the administrator is doing so only because the government has mandated that it do so. And so I think, in that case, the government is the one who is making the decision to pay these entities. And I think that's the key distinction.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  But it's the administrator who writes the check. It's not the government that writes the check.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's true, but I think, in the case of the subcontractor, it's also true that the subcontractor is paid by the prime contractor, not by the government.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Right.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think that's why I think it's a harder case.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Right. But you think that's a harder case. So that means it's not a situation that is so clear that it can be disposed of on a motion to dismiss. It has to go to a jury.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think that's right, but I think that's a -- that's a feature of the False Claims Act generally, is that it's not always going to be clear whether something is false or not. But I think, here, the government is clearly the payer of these claims. And I think that's why the government itself has treated this as the government paying the claims since the beginning of the program.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Well, let me ask you a question about your test. So, if I understand your test, it turns on whether the government mandates the payment by the administrator. Is that right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's right, yes.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. What if the government says to the administrator, you have to pay these entities, but you have discretion to determine the amount that is paid to them?  Is that still the government's money?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  Yes, I think it is. I think, in that case, the government is still the one who is making the decision to pay the money, but it's delegating to the administrator the amount.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  What if the administrator has discretion to determine which entities are going to be paid?  Is that still the government's money?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think that's a harder case. I think, in that case, it's possible that the administrator is really the one who's making the decision. And so I think that's a case in which there may not be a claim.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So the degree of discretion that is -- that is conferred on the administrator determines whether this is the government's money or not the government's money?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's right, yes.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And what is the limit on the discretion that has to be conferred?  Is it a magic number?  Is it a percentage?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the -- the -- the question would be, is the government really the one making the decision or is the administrator really the one making the decision?  And I think, in this case, it's crystal-clear it's the government.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, it's crystal-clear in this case, but what's the general test?  How are we supposed to apply this test?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the general test is, is the government really the one making the decision?  And I think, here, the government is clearly the one making the decision. I think, in the case of the subcontractor, the government is not the one making the decision. And I think, in the case where the administrator has discretion to choose who's paid, that's a harder case. I think that's a case in which there may not be a claim, but I don't think the Court needs to get into that here.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  No, I know, but if we're going to write an opinion for the Court, we have to have some idea what the general test is.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think the general test is, is the government really the one making the decision?  And I think, in this case, it's crystal-clear the government is the one making the decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that's not very helpful. The government is the one making the decision to the same extent in the subcontractor situation as it is here. The government says to the prime contractor, you have to pay your subcontractors, and the government says to the administrator, you have to pay these entities. So, in both situations, the government is making the decision. But you say that in one situation it's the government's money and in the other situation it's not the government's money.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think the difference is that, in the case of the subcontractor, the government is not the one who's making the decision about which subcontractor is paid and how much. The government is simply saying to the prime contractor, you have to pay your subcontractors. But the government is not itself making the decision about which subcontractors to pay and how much. In this case, the government is the one making the decision about which entities to pay and how much.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me come back to one --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Thank you --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  -- one last -- oh, I'm sorry.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  -- thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  No, Chief.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Alito?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  I do have one last question. Let me come back to one last question about your friend on the other side's argument that this is not the government's money because it's not in the Treasury. You said that that's wrong, that it is in the Treasury, but it's not in the general revenues of the Treasury. Where is it in the Treasury?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So it's in the Treasury's bank account. The Treasury has a bank account, and this money is in the Treasury's bank account. It's just not in the general fund. It's in a segregated account.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Thank you.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Sotomayor?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  What's the source of the government's authority to collect these fees?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think the source of the government's authority to collect the fees is Section 254 of the Communications Act, which is 47 U.S.C. 254.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then what's the source of the authority to transfer those fees to the administrator to administer this program?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's also in the same statute, 254, which -- which creates the Universal Service Fund and requires the FCC to determine how to assess and collect the fees.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then you were making the point to Justice Alito that the administrator's just an agent of the government. Is that correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's correct.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then you were making the point that the government is the one making the decision, the ultimate decision, on who's going to be paid, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's correct.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then you were making the point that the government's the one who's making the decision on how much will be paid, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's correct.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then you were making the point that the government's the one who's making the decision on the rules that will govern the program, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's correct.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M.

Justice Jackson?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  So I -- I guess I'm a little confused about the extent to which you're relying on common law.

Alito, Jr.:  Right.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think that's why I think it's a harder case.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Right. But you think that's a harder case. So that means it's not a situation that is so clear that it can be disposed of on a motion to dismiss. It has to go to a jury.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think that's right, but I think that's a -- that's a feature of the False Claims Act generally, is that it's not always going to be clear whether something is false or not. But I think, here, the government is clearly the payer of these claims. And I think that's why the government itself has treated this as the government paying the claims since the beginning of the program.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Well, let me ask you a question about your test. So, if I understand your test, it turns on whether the government mandates the payment by the administrator. Is that right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's right, yes.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. What if the government says to the administrator, you have to pay these entities, but you have discretion to determine the amount that is paid to them?  Is that still the government's money?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  Yes, I think it is. I think, in that case, the government is still the one who is making the decision to pay the money, but it's delegating to the administrator the amount.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  What if the administrator has discretion to determine which entities are going to be paid?  Is that still the government's money?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think that's a harder case. I think, in that case, it's possible that the administrator is really the one who's making the decision. And so I think that's a case in which there may not be a claim.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So the degree of discretion that is -- that is conferred on the administrator determines whether this is the government's money or not the government's money?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's right, yes.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And what is the limit on the discretion that has to be conferred?  Is it a magic number?  Is it a percentage?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the -- the -- the question would be, is the government really the one making the decision or is the administrator really the one making the decision?  And I think, in this case, it's crystal-clear it's the government.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, it's crystal-clear in this case, but what's the general test?  How are we supposed to apply this test?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the general test is, is the government really the one making the decision?  And I think, here, the government is clearly the one making the decision. I think, in the case of the subcontractor, the government is not the one making the decision. And I think, in the case where the administrator has discretion to choose who's paid, that's a harder case. I think that's a case in which there may not be a claim, but I don't think the Court needs to get into that here.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  No, I know, but if we're going to write an opinion for the Court, we have to have some idea what the general test is.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think the general test is, is the government really the one making the decision?  And I think, in this case, it's crystal-clear the government is the one making the decision.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that's not very helpful. The government is the one making the decision to the same extent in the subcontractor situation as it is here. The government says to the prime contractor, you have to pay your subcontractors, and the government says to the administrator, you have to pay these entities. So, in both situations, the government is making the decision. But you say that in one situation it's the government's money and in the other situation it's not the government's money.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think the difference is that, in the case of the subcontractor, the government is not the one who's making the decision about which subcontractor is paid and how much. The government is simply saying to the prime contractor, you have to pay your subcontractors. But the government is not itself making the decision about which subcontractors to pay and how much. In this case, the government is the one making the decision about which entities to pay and how much.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me come back to one --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Thank you --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  -- one last -- oh, I'm sorry.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  -- thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  No, Chief.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Alito?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  I do have one last question. Let me come back to one last question about your friend on the other side's argument that this is not the government's money because it's not in the Treasury. You said that that's wrong, that it is in the Treasury, but it's not in the general revenues of the Treasury. Where is it in the Treasury?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So it's in the Treasury's bank account. The Treasury has a bank account, and this money is in the Treasury's bank account. It's just not in the general fund. It's in a segregated account.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Thank you.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Sotomayor?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  What's the source of the government's authority to collect these fees?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think the source of the government's authority to collect the fees is Section 254 of the Communications Act, which is 47 U.S.C. 254.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then what's the source of the authority to transfer those fees to the administrator to administer this program?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's also in the same statute, 254, which -- which creates the Universal Service Fund and requires the FCC to determine how to assess and collect the fees.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then you were making the point to Justice Alito that the administrator's just an agent of the government. Is that correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's correct.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then you were making the point that the government is the one making the decision, the ultimate decision, on who's going to be paid, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's correct.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then you were making the point that the government's the one who's making the decision on how much will be paid, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's correct.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then you were making the point that the government's the one who's making the decision on the rules that will govern the program, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's correct.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. And then, on the question of how much will be paid, the administrator, as I understand it, has the authority to determine what the discount will be for each entity, and that determines ultimately how much will be paid, correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's right, although I think the FCC determines the category of entities that are eligible for discounts and the administrator only makes the determination as among entities within those categories.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Right. Okay. Thank you.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Barrett?  Justice Jackson?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  So I -- I guess I'm a little confused about the extent to which you're relying on common law. I mean, I hear you saying that the common law is what's relevant here, but then you also say that the common law is very flexible and that there's no one way to look at this. So what are we doing?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the common law is what the text points to. I think that's why the Court should look at the common law. And I think the common law tells you that when the government is the one making the decision to pay an entity, that is government money. And I think that's what the common law says, and that's why I think the Court should look to the common law.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  But the common law is very flexible, and so I guess I'm trying to understand, you know, what are we looking at?  I mean, are we looking at the common law of agency?  Are we looking at the common law of contract?  Are we looking at the common law of property?  I don't know.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think we're looking at the common law of agency and contract. I think that's the relevant common law. And I think the common law of agency and contract tells you that when the government is the one making the decision, that's government money.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  And is that the same common law that the government has relied on to say that this is not government money in other contexts?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the government has made inconsistent arguments, and I think it's made incorrect arguments in other contexts, but I think that's not a reason for this Court to follow those arguments.<\/START_Q>","Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  All right. Let me ask you about the -- the amount of the recovery. So, if we -- if we agree with you that this is government money and the False Claims Act applies, I understand you to say that the -- the recovery is the amount that the -- the government would have paid, the full amount that the government would have paid to the person who was supposed to be paid, not the amount that the government paid to the person who shouldn't have been paid. Is that right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's right.<\/START_Q>","Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  Okay. So --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's the -- the -- the -- the general principle, that the government is entitled to the amount it would have paid if the defendant had told the truth.<\/START_Q>","Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  Right, right, right. So, in this case, that would be the amount that the government would have paid to the school if the school had been telling the truth, if the school had been eligible, is that right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's right.<\/START_Q>","Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  And that's not the amount that the government paid to the provider, the -- the -- the -- the entity that shouldn't have been paid. So I guess I'm trying to understand why that is. If the point of the False Claims Act is to compensate the government for its losses, why isn't the amount of the recovery in this situation the amount that the government paid to the person who wasn't supposed to be paid?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the reason is that the defendant has prevented the government from learning the truth about the school, and so the government doesn't know whether the school would have been eligible or not. And so I think the right way to look at it is the government is entitled to the amount that it would have paid if the defendant had told the truth.<\/START_Q>","Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  But doesn't the government have some burden to figure out whether or not the school was eligible?  I mean, you seem to suggest that the government doesn't have any role to play in this world of figuring out whether or not the school was eligible, and if the government had figured that out, it wouldn't have paid the service provider, it would have paid the school. So why isn't it fair to say that the amount that the government is owed is the amount that it paid to the service provider?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the reason is twofold. One is that the government has been prevented from learning the truth about the school. It doesn't know whether the school would have been eligible or not. And, two, the defendant has a burden to prove its defense by a preponderance of the evidence, and so it has the burden of coming forward and establishing that the school would not have been eligible.<\/START_Q>","Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  All right. So, finally, let me just ask you, why is this case about the government's money?  I mean, I hear you, but this is a case about a private entity that was paid by another private entity for services that it performed. And so it would seem that the amount at issue is the amount that was paid by the private entity to the service provider, not the government's money. So why is this a False Claims Act case?<\/START_Q>","Tejinder Singh:  So I think it's a False Claims Act case because the government is the one who's making the decision about who gets paid and how much, and so it is really the government's money. It's just the government has delegated to another entity the authority to write the check.<\/START_Q>","Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  But the government isn't making the decision about who's going to get paid and how much in this situation. The government has said, if you're an eligible school, we will pay the -- the -- the -- the service provider on your behalf, but the government isn't involved in the decision-making as to who is eligible and which of the service providers are going to be paid.<\/START_Q>"],"unique_questions":["Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  But doesn't the government have some burden to figure out whether or not the school was eligible?

Alito, Jr.:  Well, what about a situation in which the government makes a contract with a private entity to build a dam, and the private entity hires a subcontractor, and the subcontractor is paid by the private entity?  So the subcontractor is paid by the private entity. Is that money that is provided by the government?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's a harder case. I think the difference is that in that case, the government has not mandated the relationship between the prime contractor and the subcontractor.

Kavanaugh:  Right. Okay. Thank you.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Barrett?  Justice Jackson?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  So I -- I guess I'm a little confused about the extent to which you're relying on common law. I mean, I hear you saying that the common law is what's relevant here, but then you also say that the common law is very flexible and that there's no one way to look at this. So what are we doing?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the common law is what the text points to. I think that's why the Court should look at the common law. And I think the common law tells you that when the government is the one making the decision to pay an entity, that is government money. And I think that's what the common law says, and that's why I think the Court should look to the common law.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  But the common law is very flexible, and so I guess I'm trying to understand, you know, what are we looking at?  I mean, are we looking at the common law of agency?  Are we looking at the common law of contract?  Are we looking at the common law of property?  I don't know.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think we're looking at the common law of agency and contract. I think that's the relevant common law. And I think the common law of agency and contract tells you that when the government is the one making the decision, that's government money.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  And is that the same common law that the government has relied on to say that this is not government money in other contexts?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the government has made inconsistent arguments, and I think it's made incorrect arguments in other contexts, but I think that's not a reason for this Court to follow those arguments.<\/START_Q>","Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  And that's not the amount that the government paid to the provider, the -- the -- the -- the entity that shouldn't have been paid. So I guess I'm trying to understand why that is. If the point of the False Claims Act is to compensate the government for its losses, why isn't the amount of the recovery in this situation the amount that the government paid to the person who wasn't supposed to be paid?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the reason is that the defendant has prevented the government from learning the truth about the school, and so the government doesn't know whether the school would have been eligible or not. And so I think the right way to look at it is the government is entitled to the amount that it would have paid if the defendant had told the truth.<\/START_Q>","Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  But the government isn't making the decision about who's going to get paid and how much in this situation. The government has said, if you're an eligible school, we will pay the -- the -- the -- the service provider on your behalf, but the government isn't involved in the decision-making as to who is eligible and which of the service providers are going to be paid.<\/START_Q>","Tejinder Singh:  So I think it's a False Claims Act case because the government is the one who's making the decision about who gets paid and how much, and so it is really the government's money. It's just the government has delegated to another entity the authority to write the check.<\/START_Q>","Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  Okay. So --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's the -- the -- the -- the general principle, that the government is entitled to the amount it would have paid if the defendant had told the truth.<\/START_Q>","Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  Right, right, right. So, in this case, that would be the amount that the government would have paid to the school if the school had been telling the truth, if the school had been eligible, is that right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's right.<\/START_Q>"],"num_unique_questions":9,"num_questions":9,"prediction":"[\"Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  But doesn't the government have some burden to figure out whether or not the school was eligible?  I mean, you seem to suggest that the government doesn't have any role to play in this world of figuring out whether or not the school was eligible, and if the government had figured that out, it wouldn't have paid the service provider, it would have paid the school. So why isn't it fair to say that the amount that the government is owed is the amount that it paid to the service provider?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the reason is twofold. One is that the government has been prevented from learning the truth about the school. It doesn't know whether the school would have been eligible or not. And, two, the defendant has a burden to prove its defense by a preponderance of the evidence, and so it has the burden of coming forward and establishing that the school would not have been eligible.<\/START_Q>\", \"Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  All right. So, finally, let me just ask you, why is this case about the government's money?  I mean, I hear you, but this is a case about a private entity that was paid by another private entity for services that it performed. And so it would seem that the amount at issue is the amount that was paid by the private entity to the service provider, not the government's money. So why is this a False Claims Act case?<\/START_Q>\", \"Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  All right. Let me ask you about the -- the amount of the recovery. So, if we -- if we agree with you that this is government money and the False Claims Act applies, I understand you to say that the -- the recovery is the amount that the -- the government would have paid, the full amount that the government would have paid to the person who was supposed to be paid, not the amount that the government paid to the person who shouldn't have been paid. Is that right?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's right.<\/START_Q>\", \"Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, what about a situation in which the government makes a contract with a private entity to build a dam, and the private entity hires a subcontractor, and the subcontractor is paid by the private entity?  So the subcontractor is paid by the private entity. Is that money that is provided by the government?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's a harder case. I think the difference is that in that case, the government has not mandated the relationship between the prime contractor and the subcontractor. So I think, in that case, the subcontractor would not have a claim because the government has not mandated the payment.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, the government has mandated the payment. The government says to the prime contractor, we want you to build this dam, and you have to pay your subcontractors. So, in that sense, the government has mandated the payment. But the subcontractor is paid by the prime contractor, not by the government.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I -- I think the distinction is that the government is not the one who is deciding that this subcontractor is the one who should be paid. It is the prime contractor. So I think that is a harder case. I think that's a case in which the subcontractor would not have a claim.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, why isn't this similar?  Why isn't this similar?  The government says to the administrator, we want you to administer this program, and you have to pay these people. And the administrator says, okay, I will do that. So the administrator is the one who pays them, not the government.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  Well, I think that the administrator is the one who pays them, but the administrator is doing so only because the government has mandated that it do so. And so I think, in that case, the government is the one who is making the decision to pay these entities. And I think that's the key distinction.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  But it's the administrator who writes the check. It's not the government that writes the check.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's true, but I think, in the case of the subcontractor, it's also true that the subcontractor is paid by the prime contractor, not by the government.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Right.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think that's why I think it's a harder case.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Right. But you think that's a harder case. So that means it's not a situation that is so clear that it can be disposed of on a motion to dismiss. It has to go to a jury.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think that's right, but I think that's a -- that's a feature of the False Claims Act generally, is that it's not always going to be clear whether something is false or not. But I think, here, the government is clearly the payer of these claims. And I think that's why the government itself has treated this as the government paying the claims since the beginning of the program.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Well, let me ask you a question about your test. So, if I understand your test, it turns on whether the government mandates the payment by the administrator. Is that right?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's right, yes.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. What if the government says to the administrator, you have to pay these entities, but you have discretion to determine the amount that is paid to them?  Is that still the government's money?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  Yes, I think it is. I think, in that case, the government is still the one who is making the decision to pay the money, but it's delegating to the administrator the amount.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  What if the administrator has discretion to determine which entities are going to be paid?  Is that still the government's money?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think that's a harder case. I think, in that case, it's possible that the administrator is really the one who's making the decision. And so I think that's a case in which there may not be a claim.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So the degree of discretion that is -- that is conferred on the administrator determines whether this is the government's money or not the government's money?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's right, yes.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And what is the limit on the discretion that has to be conferred?  Is it a magic number?  Is it a percentage?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the -- the -- the question would be, is the government really the one making the decision or is the administrator really the one making the decision?  And I think, in this case, it's crystal-clear it's the government.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, it's crystal-clear in this case, but what's the general test?  How are we supposed to apply this test?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So I think the general test is, is the government really the one making the decision?  And I think, here, the government is clearly the one making the decision. I think, in the case of the subcontractor, the government is not the one making the decision. And I think, in the case where the administrator has discretion to choose who's paid, that's a harder case. I think that's a case in which there may not be a claim, but I don't think the Court needs to get into that here.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  No, I know, but if we're going to write an opinion for the Court, we have to have some idea what the general test is.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think the general test is, is the government really the one making the decision?  And I think, in this case, it's crystal-clear the government is the one making the decision.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that's not very helpful. The government is the one making the decision to the same extent in the subcontractor situation as it is here. The government says to the prime contractor, you have to pay your subcontractors, and the government says to the administrator, you have to pay these entities. So, in both situations, the government is making the decision. But you say that in one situation it's the government's money and in the other situation it's not the government's money.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think the difference is that, in the case of the subcontractor, the government is not the one who's making the decision about which subcontractor is paid and how much. The government is simply saying to the prime contractor, you have to pay your subcontractors. But the government is not itself making the decision about which subcontractors to pay and how much. In this case, the government is the one making the decision about which entities to pay and how much.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Let me come back to one --<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Thank you --<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  -- one last -- oh, I'm sorry.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  -- thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  No, Chief.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Alito?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  I do have one last question. Let me come back to one last question about your friend on the other side's argument that this is not the government's money because it's not in the Treasury. You said that that's wrong, that it is in the Treasury, but it's not in the general revenues of the Treasury. Where is it in the Treasury?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  So it's in the Treasury's bank account. The Treasury has a bank account, and this money is in the Treasury's bank account. It's just not in the general fund. It's in a segregated account.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Thank you.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Sotomayor?  Justice Kagan? Justice Gorsuch?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  What's the source of the government's authority to collect these fees?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think the source of the government's authority to collect the fees is Section 254 of the Communications Act, which is 47 U.S.C. 254.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then what's the source of the authority to transfer those fees to the administrator to administer this program?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  I think that's also in the same statute, 254, which -- which creates the Universal Service Fund and requires the FCC to determine how to assess and collect the fees.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then you were making the point to Justice Alito that the administrator's just an agent of the government. Is that correct?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's correct.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then you were making the point that the government is the one making the decision, the ultimate decision, on who's going to be paid, correct?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's correct.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then you were making the point that the government's the one who's making the decision on how much will be paid, correct?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's correct.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  And then you were making the point that the government's the one who's making the decision on the rules that will govern the program, correct?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's correct.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Okay. And then, on the question of how much will be paid, the administrator, as I understand it, has the authority to determine what the discount will be for each entity, and that determines ultimately how much will be paid, correct?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Tejinder Singh:  That's right, although I think the FCC determines the category of entities that are eligible for discounts and the administrator only makes the determination as among entities within those categories.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh:  Right. Okay. Thank you.<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Barrett?  Justice Jackson?<\/START_Q>\\n        <START_Q> Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:  So I -- I guess I'm a little confused about the extent to which you're relying on common law. I mean, I hear you saying that the common law is what's relevant here, but then you also say that the common law is very flexible and that there's no one way to look at this.

Alito, Jr.\n        Opening Statement: <speaker>Seth P. Waxman<\/speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Richard Glossip was convicted on the word of one man, Justin Sneed, the undisputed murderer in this case. Oklahoma has now disclosed evidence revealing that Mr. Sneed lied to the jury about his history of psychiatric treatment, including the fact that a prison psychiatrist prescribed lithium to treat his previously undiagnosed bipolar disorder. The prosecution suppressed that evidence and then failed to correct Mr. Sneed's perjured denial, just as it suppressed evidence that in the middle of trial, in violation of the court's sequestration order, Sneed altered his testimony about the knife wounds on the victim at the urgent request of the prosecutor, who then falsely denied to the court her prior knowledge. There is no adequate or independent jurisdictional bar to review and no warrant for an evidentiary hearing. As to independence, the court's opinion is suffused with merits determinations on the Brady and Napue claims. And, certainly, there is no \"clear and express statement\" that the court's decision is based on a bona fide separate, adequate, and independent grounds, as long required by this Court to preclude review. Nor is there any adequate bar. By rejecting the State's waiver, the court created a jurisdictional threshold it had never applied in any other case. The disposition was \"without support in prior state law,\" as required by over 60 years of this Court's precedent to establish adequacy. No evidentiary hearing could alter the conclusion that Mr. Glossip was denied due process. There's no dispute that, contrary to Sneed's sworn testimony, the State's own suppressed record shows that he was, in fact, treated by a psychiatrist for bipolar disorder, just as there is no dispute that Sneed changed his testimony about the knife at the  urgent mid-trial request of the prosecutor, who then falsely denied that very fact to the court. This Court should reverse and remand for a new trial. I welcome the Court's questions.<\/text>\n\n        ### Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Mr. Waxman, this is a very complicated case, and I'm not sure I understand the -- the procedural posture of the case and the way in which the -- the Oklahoma court analyzed the case. So, if you could clarify that for me. The case began as a successive application for post-conviction relief. And then the -- the case was treated as though it were a -- a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. And then the court addressed various grounds, including the claim that the evidence that was produced by the discovery in the -- in the federal case showed that Mr. Sneed's testimony was perjured. Is that right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And then the court went on to say that even if the evidence was sufficient to show that his testimony was perjured, the defendant would have to show that the perjured testimony was material, and the court said that it wasn't material because it was -- it was -- it was immaterial and harmless. So that's how the court analyzed the case. Now, as I understand your position, you say that we should not get to the question of whether the perjured testimony was material because the court's ruling was based on an independent and adequate state ground. Is that right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Okay. Thank you.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A.

Is that correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Now, if we get to that, you say that the standard for materiality in this situation is the standard that applies in a -- in a -- in a situation where there's a Brady violation, and that is that there has to be a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different if the evidence had been presented. Is that correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Okay. Now, in -- in a Brady case, the defendant is entitled to have the evidence that should have been turned over, and then the question is whether, if that evidence had been turned over, there's a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different. But, in this case, the evidence that you want to introduce is evidence that the testimony was perjured. And so the question would be whether there's a reasonable probability that if the jury knew that the testimony was perjured, the verdict would have been different.

Alito, Jr. is likely to ask:\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Mr. Clement, I want to ask you about the first of the two claims that you've raised. As I understand it, the claim is that the prosecutor withheld information that would have been helpful to the defendant in impeaching a witness. Is that correct?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Paul D. Clement:  I think that's right, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Okay. So it's an impeachment claim. And the question is whether the information that was withheld was material. Now, in a case like this, what is the way of determining whether it is material?  Is it just a matter of the prosecutor saying, well, I don't think it would have been important, or is it something else?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Paul D. Clement:  Well, I think, at the end of the day, it's a legal question, but I think you have to look at it in context. And I think, here, you have to look at it in context of the fact that the only other witness to the crime was a co-defendant who had a history of lying to the police, who had a history of blaming Mr. Glossip for the crime, who had a history of trying to get a better deal for himself, and who had a history of telling the police that he would do anything to get out of this, including lying. So I think, in that context, you have to look at the evidence that was withheld, and the evidence that was withheld was that the State's key witness had bipolar disorder, which is a mental illness that can affect perception, affect memory, and affect credibility. And I think that's what makes it so material.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, what if the prosecutor had said, well, I don't think this is important because this person's bipolar disorder was under control at the time?  Would that have been enough?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Paul D. Clement:  I think, at that point, Your Honor, I think you're getting into the merits of the Brady claim, which is obviously something that the State confessed error on. And I think, at that point, you'd want to look at the entire record in context, including the fact that there was a lot of other evidence that was withheld that was highly material to the case. But I do think that the fact that this was a bipolar disorder, which is a serious mental illness, I think that's the kind of thing that a defense attorney would want to know. And I think it's the kind of thing that could affect perception, memory, and credibility.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, if it's a legal question, how do we review a determination by a state court that it was not material?  Is that de novo?  Is that clear -- is that clearly erroneous?  Is it something else?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Paul D. Clement:  Well, I think it's de novo, Your Honor, but I think, here, it's not a question of looking at the trial court's assessment of the materiality because the trial court never made that assessment. It never reached the merits of the Brady claim. Instead, it just said that this is something that could have been raised earlier, and, therefore, it's procedurally barred. And so I think, at that point, you look at the record and you look at the merits of the Brady claim, and I think that's where you get to the point where you say this is the kind of thing that could affect perception, memory, and credibility, and it's the kind of thing that a defense attorney would want to know.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, if it's de novo, then we decide whether, in our judgment, this was material. We're not looking at some historical facts. We're making a legal judgment, right?<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Paul D. Clement:  I think that's right, Your Honor, but I think it's informed by the historical facts of the case.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, the historical fact is that the trial judge found this witness to be entirely credible and made a determination that the defendant was guilty based on this witness's testimony.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Paul D. Clement:  Well, Your Honor, I think that's not actually true. I mean, I think the trial court's finding of guilt was not based on the testimony of the witness. I think it was based on the testimony of both witnesses. And I think the problem is that you have one witness who had a history of lying to the police, blaming Mr. Glossip for the crime, and trying to get a better deal for himself, and you have another witness whose mental illness could affect his perception, his memory, and his credibility. And I think, in that context, the fact that this information was withheld from the defense, I think that's what makes it so material.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G.

And I think, at that point, you'd want to look at the entire record in context, including the fact that there was a lot of other evidence that was withheld that was highly material to the case. But I do think that the fact that this was a bipolar disorder, which is a serious mental illness, I think that's the kind of thing that a defense attorney would want to know. And I think it's the kind of thing that could affect perception, memory, and credibility.<\/text>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A.

Alito, Jr.\n        Opening Statement: <speaker>Frederick Liu<\/speaker><text> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  San Francisco's opening brief makes one and only one argument, that Section 1311(b)(1)(C) authorizes only effluent limitations. This Court, however, already rejected that argument in National Association of Manufacturers. And, in any event, the statutory text and history make clear that Section 1311(b)(1)(C) also authorizes other limitations. San  -- San Francisco is therefore wrong to argue that limitations like the ones challenged here are never okay. But that does not mean that they are always okay. Under the statute, EPA may rely on limitations like the ones here only when EPA lacks assurance that the permit's effluent limitations alone are insufficient to protect water quality. Even then, EPA may rely on limitations like the ones here only when EPA lacks the information necessary to develop more  tailored limitations. And, finally, EPA may not impose limitations of any kind that are unconstitutionally vague. San Francisco pressed each of those limiting principles below. But the court of appeals rejected each of San Francisco's case-specific challenges. The court held at Petition Appendix 40 that the permit's effluent limitations alone would be insufficient to protect water quality. The court held at Petition Appendix 46 to 47 that San Francisco had failed to update its long-term control plan, thus depriving EPA of the information necessary to develop more tailored limitations.

Below is an opening statement from a Supreme Court case and the name of a specific justice. Your task is to generate a list of questions that this justice is likely to ask in response to the opening statement. These questions should reflect the justice\u2019s known priorities, jurisprudence, and typical questioning style, and they should be directly relevant to the arguments presented in the opening statement.\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Carefully analyze the opening statement to identify key arguments, assumptions, or ambiguities.\n        2. Generate questions that the specified justice might ask. Limit to 15 or less questions. Do not repeat questions.\n        3. Format each question with specific start and end tags for easier parsing:\n           - Use `<START_Q>` at the beginning of each question.\n           - Use `<END_Q>` at the end of each question.\n\n        ### Example:\n        ### Your Task:\n        Justice: {justice_name}\n        Opening Statement: {opening_statement}\n\n        ### Output:\n        A list of questions that {justice_name} is likely to ask:\n        <START_Q> text of question one <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> text of question two <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> text of question three <END_Q><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Your Task:\n        Justice: Justice Samuel A.

Roberts, Jr.:  General, the Ninth Circuit said that the limitations here were not arbitrary or capricious because they were necessary to protect water quality. Do you think that's correct?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, what is the  -- what is the standard?  What do you think the Ninth Circuit should have said?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but, I mean, that's  -- that's not necessary to protect water quality. I mean, it's not a question of whether or not it's going to be protected. The question is whether or not it's going to be protected by the limitations in the permit.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, it  -- it's -- it's -- it's a question of what the permit is going to do. And the permit is going to require the discharger to take certain actions to protect water quality, and the question is whether or not that's necessary to protect water quality. And I don't think it's necessary to protect water quality if it's going to be protected anyway.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but that's not the question, right?  The question is whether or not the permit is going to protect water quality, and if it is, then I don't see why it's necessary to impose these additional limitations.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, I think it's a pretty big difference. I mean, the one is whether or not the water quality is going to be protected, and the other is whether or not the permit is going to protect the water quality. And it seems to me that the latter is the correct standard.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but that's not what the Ninth Circuit said. It said that the limitations were necessary to protect water quality.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, I think it's a big difference. And I think the difference is, if you say that the limitations are necessary to protect water quality, you're saying that they're necessary to protect water quality, and that's the end of the case. If you say that the limitations are necessary to ensure that the permit is going to protect water quality, that means that you're looking at the terms of the permit, and if they're going to protect water quality, then you don't need the additional limitations.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but that's not what the Ninth Circuit said.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, I know, but it's  -- it's -- it's -- it's a big difference, it seems to me, in the two standards. And I'm just trying to figure out which one you think is the right standard.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  I'll bet. But, if that's the case, then why did the Ninth Circuit say that the limitations were necessary to protect water quality?  That's not the issue. The issue is whether or not the permit is going to protect water quality, and if it is, you don't need the additional limitations.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but that's not what the Ninth Circuit said.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, I  --I understand that. But, if you're saying that the Ninth Circuit erred, then what is the correct standard?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, I think it's a big difference. I mean, if -- if the  -- the  --the standard is that the limitations have to be necessary to protect water quality, then, you know, you're saying that the water quality is not protected, and if it is, then you don't need the additional limitations. On the other hand, if you're saying that the limitations have to be necessary to ensure that the permit is going to protect water quality, then you're saying, well, the permit is protecting water quality, and, therefore, you need the additional limitations.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, I know, but that's not what the Ninth Circuit said.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  I know, but I'm trying to figure out what you think the correct standard is.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Right.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, that's a different question, though. I mean, the question is, if the permit is going to protect water quality, you don't need the additional limitations. If the permit is not going to protect water quality, then you do need the additional limitations. And the Ninth Circuit said that the additional limitations were necessary to protect water quality, which is not the same thing.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, that's right, but that's not what the Ninth Circuit said.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, I know. I mean, I understand you think the Ninth Circuit was wrong, but I'm trying to figure out what you think the correct standard is.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but that's not the question. The question is whether or not the limitations in the permit are sufficient to protect water quality.

But, if that's the case, then why did the Ninth Circuit say that the limitations were necessary to protect water quality?  That's not the issue. The issue is whether or not the permit is going to protect water quality, and if it is, you don't need the additional limitations.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but that's not what the Ninth Circuit said.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, I  --I understand that. But, if you're saying that the Ninth Circuit erred, then what is the correct standard?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, I think it's a big difference. I mean, if -- if the  -- the  --the standard is that the limitations have to be necessary to protect water quality, then, you know, you're saying that the water quality is not protected, and if it is, then you don't need the additional limitations. On the other hand, if you're saying that the limitations have to be necessary to ensure that the permit is going to protect water quality, then you're saying, well, the permit is protecting water quality, and, therefore, you need the additional limitations.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G.

Roberts, Jr.:  Right.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, that's a different question, though. I mean, the question is, if the permit is going to protect water quality, you don't need the additional limitations. If the permit is not going to protect water quality, then you do need the additional limitations. And the Ninth Circuit said that the additional limitations were necessary to protect water quality, which is not the same thing.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, that's right, but that's not what the Ninth Circuit said.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, I know. I mean, I understand you think the Ninth Circuit was wrong, but I'm trying to figure out what you think the correct standard is.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but that's not the question. The question is whether or not the limitations in the permit are sufficient to protect water quality. And if they are, you don't need the additional limitations.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, that's not what the Ninth Circuit said.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G.

Do you think that's correct?","Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, what is the  -- what is the standard?  What do you think the Ninth Circuit should have said?","Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but, I mean, that's  -- that's not necessary to protect water quality. I mean, it's not a question of whether or not it's going to be protected.

Chief Justice Marshall held in Mollan against Torrance in 1824 that in a diversity case, a federal court's jurisdiction once vested cannot be divested by subsequent events. The Court extended that reasoning to removal actions in Kirby against American Soda in 1904. And in 1938, this Court held in St. Paul  Mercury that if the plaintiff after removal amends his pleadings, this does not deprive the district court of jurisdiction because the defendant's statutory right to removal should not be subject to the plaintiff's caprice. The second Justice Marshall confirmed that conclusion in Carnegie -Mellon against Cohill in 1988, and Justice Scalia concurred in Rockwell in 2007. Respondents ask this Court to upset that settled interpretation, claiming that it conflicts with the text of Section 1367. But  Congress codified this Court's longstanding precedent in the text of Section 1367 itself, making clear that if the federal court has original jurisdiction, it shall continue to have supplemental jurisdiction unless Congress expressly provided otherwise. Respondents cannot cite a single decision of this Court, a single decision of a court of appeals outside of the Eighth Circuit, or a single treatise that supports their position. Respondents realize how weak their case is and instead ask the Court to decide something else, whether Grable should be overruled and, if not, whether Grable's requirements were met.

Alito, Jr.:  If I could just clarify something. You're not arguing that there's a constitutional requirement of original jurisdiction at the time of removal?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So, if this were a statutory removal provision, you think the result would be the same?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And that's because the text of 1367 refers to original jurisdiction?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So the argument is that Congress chose to use the term \"original jurisdiction\" in order to incorporate the well- established principles that existed at the time when it was enacted?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And you think that's true even though the text of 1441(a) doesn't refer to original jurisdiction?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, then what's the -- what's the basis for the argument that Congress used the term \"original jurisdiction\" in 1367 in order to incorporate the well- established principles that existed at the time when 1441(a) was enacted?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  What -- what -- what's the basis for that argument?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, it says -- it says \"the district courts shall have original jurisdiction,\" right?  And then it goes on to say what that original jurisdiction consists of. So I don't see how you can get around that.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  No, but what's the -- what's the basis for the argument that Congress used the term \"original jurisdiction\" in order to incorporate the well- established principles that existed at the time when 1441(a) was enacted?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah, but that's not what 1441(a) says.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I understand that. But I -- I don't understand the argument. Maybe it's just a play on words, but I don't understand the argument that Congress used the term \"original jurisdiction\" in order to incorporate the well- established principles that existed at the time when 1441(a) was enacted. So, if 1441(a) didn't refer to original jurisdiction, if it just said, you know, the district court has jurisdiction, you would lose, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah. So that's what I'm trying to understand. I don't understand that argument.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  I mean, I think there's a lot of -- a lot of force to the argument that if the -- if the plaintiff can defeat removal by simply filing an amended complaint that eliminates the federal claim, that that's a -- that that's a -- that's a very odd result. But I'm just trying to understand the statutory argument here.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah, okay. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  I mean, you're saying Congress thought that this was such a big deal that they were willing to use this terminology in order to make sure that this result was produced. Is that the argument?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah. Okay.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So, if it's not jurisdictional, how can you say that the district court lacks the power to adjudicate the claim?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, you can't do that in a diversity case either, right?  I mean, if there's no diversity, the federal court doesn't have the power to adjudicate the claim, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I mean, the -- the district court doesn't have the power to adjudicate a claim if it's not a claim that arises under federal law, right?  I mean, that's the whole point of -- of 1331, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah. No, I understand. I understand. I understand the argument. I just -- I just don't know what to make of it, and that's why I'm asking these questions.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I mean, it's not -- it's not just a matter of the plaintiff's caprice. It's a matter of the plaintiff's right to amend the complaint, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that's the -- I mean, that's the whole point of the -- the argument on the other side, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Okay. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  I have one more question, and I'm sorry to take up so much time. But, on the -- on the Grable issue, you know, the -- the plaintiff has to have a federal claim in order to have a federal question, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And if the plaintiff has a federal claim, then the plaintiff can always bring a federal lawsuit, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So it's not a matter of the plaintiff having to abandon a federal claim, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So the question is whether the plaintiff can choose to bring the federal claim in federal court or has to bring it in state court, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And why isn't that exactly what Congress provided for in 1441?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So, if the plaintiff doesn't want to bring the federal claim in federal court, the plaintiff can just bring it in state court, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So the plaintiff doesn't have to abandon the federal claim, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  No, I understand that. But the plaintiff can bring the federal claim in state court, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Thomas, anything?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  One question.

Alito, Jr.:  If I could just clarify something. You're not arguing that there's a constitutional requirement of original jurisdiction at the time of removal?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. So, if this were a statutory removal provision, you think the result would be the same?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And that's because the text of 1367 refers to original jurisdiction?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So the argument is that Congress chose to use the term \"original jurisdiction\" in order to incorporate the well- established principles that existed at the time when it was enacted?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And you think that's true even though the text of 1441(a) doesn't refer to original jurisdiction?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, then what's the -- what's the basis for the argument that Congress used the term \"original jurisdiction\" in 1367 in order to incorporate the well- established principles that existed at the time when 1441(a) was enacted?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  What -- what -- what's the basis for that argument?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, it says -- it says \"the district courts shall have original jurisdiction,\" right?  And then it goes on to say what that original jurisdiction consists of. So I don't see how you can get around that.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  No, but what's the -- what's the basis for the argument that Congress used the term \"original jurisdiction\" in order to incorporate the well- established principles that existed at the time when 1441(a) was enacted?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah, but that's not what 1441(a) says.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I understand that. But I -- I don't understand the argument. Maybe it's just a play on words, but I don't understand the argument that Congress used the term \"original jurisdiction\" in order to incorporate the well- established principles that existed at the time when 1441(a) was enacted. So, if 1441(a) didn't refer to original jurisdiction, if it just said, you know, the district court has jurisdiction, you would lose, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah. So that's what I'm trying to understand. I don't understand that argument.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  I mean, I think there's a lot of -- a lot of force to the argument that if the -- if the plaintiff can defeat removal by simply filing an amended complaint that eliminates the federal claim, that that's a -- that that's a -- that's a very odd result. But I'm just trying to understand the statutory argument here.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah, okay. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  I mean, you're saying Congress thought that this was such a big deal that they were willing to use this terminology in order to make sure that this result was produced. Is that the argument?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah. Okay.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So, if it's not jurisdictional, how can you say that the district court lacks the power to adjudicate the claim?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, you can't do that in a diversity case either, right?  I mean, if there's no diversity, the federal court doesn't have the power to adjudicate the claim, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I mean, the -- the district court doesn't have the power to adjudicate a claim if it's not a claim that arises under federal law, right?  I mean, that's the whole point of -- of 1331, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah. No, I understand. I understand. I understand the argument. I just -- I just don't know what to make of it, and that's why I'm asking these questions.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I mean, it's not -- it's not just a matter of the plaintiff's caprice. It's a matter of the plaintiff's right to amend the complaint, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, that's the -- I mean, that's the whole point of the -- the argument on the other side, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Okay. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  I have one more question, and I'm sorry to take up so much time. But, on the -- on the Grable issue, you know, the -- the plaintiff has to have a federal claim in order to have a federal question, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And if the plaintiff has a federal claim, then the plaintiff can always bring a federal lawsuit, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So it's not a matter of the plaintiff having to abandon a federal claim, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So the question is whether the plaintiff can choose to bring the federal claim in federal court or has to bring it in state court, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And why isn't that exactly what Congress provided for in 1441?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So, if the plaintiff doesn't want to bring the federal claim in federal court, the plaintiff can just bring it in state court, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  So the plaintiff doesn't have to abandon the federal claim, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  No, I understand that. But the plaintiff can bring the federal claim in state court, right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Thomas, anything?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  One question.

I don't mean to interrupt you, but I'm just curious about the mechanics of it.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Yeah.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  But how do you know that?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So what's the difference between significant and substantial?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  I know, but I'm trying to figure out how you get from significant to substantial.

Roberts, Jr.:  Counsel, I think you just said that the text is dispositive. But, of course, the text of 1441(a) doesn't talk about the complaint at all. It talks about the cause of action. And I wonder if your position is more consistent with that language than your friend's?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, I think the question is whether or not the cause of action is still part of the action. And I would have thought that the answer to that is no. I mean, it's just not part of the action anymore. You've amended the complaint and taken it out.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, I don't know that that's true. I mean, you know, you can have a case that has 10 causes of action, and if one of them is dismissed, the case is not dismissed. And I think it's a little bit of a stretch to say that if you have a case with 10 causes of action and one of them is federal, it's still a federal case if you drop the federal one.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G.

Roberts, Jr.:  Well, that's right. But that's -- that's the point. It's not part of the action anymore. And I understood the point of your friend to be that, well, if you look at the complaint, it's not part of the action anymore. And if you look at the cause of action, it's not part of the cause of action anymore.<\/START_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <\/turn>\n        <turn>Justice John G.

But, of course, the text of 1441(a) doesn't talk about the complaint at all. It talks about the cause of action. And I wonder if your position is more consistent with that language than your friend's?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, I think the question is whether or not the cause of action is still part of the action. And I would have thought that the answer to that is no. I mean, it's just not part of the action anymore. You've amended the complaint and taken it out.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, I don't know that that's true. I mean, you know, you can have a case that has 10 causes of action, and if one of them is dismissed, the case is not dismissed. And I think it's a little bit of a stretch to say that if you have a case with 10 causes of action and one of them is federal, it's still a federal case if you drop the federal one.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but it's still part of the action. And I think that's the question. It's not part of the action anymore.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G.

Roberts, Jr.:  Well, that's right. But that's -- that's the point. It's not part of the action anymore. And I understood the point of your friend to be that, well, if you look at the complaint, it's not part of the action anymore.

In context, that requirement applies not just to the day of approval but to the next day as well. In other words, the petition cannot remain approved if the agency reconsiders its initial decision and concludes that there was a sham marriage. That's because an approved visa petition confers no substantive benefits. It is simply a piece of paper signifying that a beneficiary is eligible to apply for a green card. If Congress believed you shouldn't get that piece of paper saying that you're eligible when you've been in a sham marriage, then -- then the agency has to take it away when it determines that you're not, in fact, eligible. That resolves this case. Because the revocation here was non-discretionary, it is reviewable. The government seeks to shield  itself from judicial review by claiming it has discretion to not revoke the petition even after a sham -marriage finding. Yet it identifies no circumstance in which it has ever or would ever exercise that purported discretion. Nor does it explain what purpose such discretion could serve if, as the government appears to believe, it's not actually allowed to give the beneficiary a green card. The discretion appears to simply be the discretion to allow a person to hold on to a now meaningless piece of paper that has been drained of all of its value. That cannot be the kind  of discretion that Congress sought to protect. The government's view also layers one anomaly on top of another. Most significantly, it creates a disparity in review between an initial decision and a reconsideration of that same decision based on the same criteria. And the government concedes that a person could obtain review if they filed a new -- a new petition and had it denied. But that gives the game away. That is the exact same non-discretionary decision  that the government claims needs to be shielded from review.

Given this volume, Congress had every reason to streamline judicial review by prohibiting litigation at the revocation  stage. And, to be clear, the government believes that Congress did prohibit litigation by making revocations discretionary, including in the face of a sham-marriage determination. The government does not view a revocation as mandatory in that stage, and I am not aware of a longstanding position of the kind that counsel suggests. The text is very clear on this. Section 1252 bars review of actions, the authority for which is specified to be in the  discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security. And Section 1155 specifies that the  Secretary's authority to revoke visa petitions is discretionary at least three times over, as Justice Alito was noting. It uses the term \"may,\" which connotes discretion. It uses the term \"deems,\" which  fairly exudes discretion. And it uses the capacious term \"good and sufficient cause,\" which calls for a discretionary judgment. Now I -- I don't hear Petitioner today to be advancing the secondary argument that I think we saw in his briefing with respect to the idea that a sham -- at least an underlying sham-marriage determination might be reviewable even if the revocation decision itself is  not because the revocation decision is clearly discretionary under Section 1155, and I think that's for good reason. I don't think that this Court has ever suggested that someone can evade a judicial review bar on review of a decision by breaking that decision into its constituent parts.

Roberts, Jr.:  Counsel, I'd like to ask you the same question I asked your friend. Do you agree that the  --the Petitioner has a liberty interest in being considered for adjustment of status?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  We do not agree that he has a liberty interest in being considered for adjustment of status. And the reason for that is because adjustment of status is a discretionary determination. And that's not just a discretionary determination for the Attorney General; it's also a discretionary determination for the Secretary. And so, when you have a discretionary determination, that is not the sort of thing that you can have a liberty interest in. And the reason for that is because, when you have a liberty interest, you have a due process right to notice and a hearing. And so, if you had a liberty interest in adjustment of status, that would mean that you would be entitled to a hearing on your application for adjustment of status. And that is not the sort of thing that the INA provides for.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, what if you're -- what if the -- the ground for denial of adjustment of status is that the person is a member of a gang?  Do you think he has a liberty interest in that determination?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I do not think he has a liberty interest in that determination. I think that's a discretionary determination as well. And I think that's consistent with this Court's decision in Mandel, where it said that the  --the fact that the government is acting in its exercise of consular functions, which is what it is doing when it's determining whether to grant adjustment of status, that that is not the sort of thing that is subject to judicial review. And so I think that's  --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, that's because it's a consular function. I mean, that's a totally different context. But, here, the -- the denial of the application for adjustment of status is based on a factual ground, right, he's a member of a gang, and he says, no, I'm not. And you're saying that he has no liberty interest in that determination?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  That is correct. I think that that is a discretionary determination. And I think that's what this Court said in Romero, that the  -- the denial of discretionary relief is not the sort of thing that triggers procedural due process.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but it's not  -- it's not discretionary whether he's a member of a gang or not, right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  It's not discretionary whether he's a member of a gang or not, but it is discretionary whether to grant adjustment of status to someone who is a member of a gang. And so that is the discretionary determination that's being made. And so, for example, if you had a gang member who came forward and said, I have repented, I am no longer a gang member, I want to cooperate with law enforcement, the government could, in its discretion, say, you know what, we're going to give you adjustment of status because you're cooperating with us. But, if instead that person said, no, I'm still an active gang member and I'm proud of it, then the government is not going to give adjustment of status to that person. And so that is a discretionary determination that is being made. And I think that's consistent with this Court's precedents, that discretionary determinations are not the sort of thing that trigger procedural due process.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Counsel, you said in your brief that Petitioner's argument would \"muddle\" the distinction between a judgment and an action. And I -- I want to give you a chance to expand on that. What is the distinction between a judgment and an action?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  The distinction between a judgment and an action is that an action is the thing that triggers the jurisdiction of the court. So it's the complaint that is filed that says I am bringing this claim against you. A judgment, on the other hand, is the court's determination of the rights and liabilities of the parties. And so, in this context, the judgment is the final order of removal. And so the -- the -- the action is the thing that starts the case. It's the thing that triggers the jurisdiction of the court. And that's what's being described in 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). And so that's why we think that that provision is referring to the final order of removal and not to any other determination that might be made in the course of the case.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but the action is the denial of the application for adjustment of status, right?<\/START_Q>\n        <END_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I  --I -- I -- I do not think that that is correct, that the denial of the application for adjustment of status is the action that triggers the jurisdiction of the court. And I think that's because, in  -- in the INA, Congress has separated out the various steps that are taken in the removal process. And so it has said, in Section 1229a, that the government initiates removal proceedings by filing a notice to appear. And then, in Section 1229(b), it says that the government can then file additional factual allegations in a notice of hearing. And so the government has separated out these various steps in the process. And so I think that when you're looking at what is the action that triggers the jurisdiction of the court, that is the final order of removal, which is the thing that actually triggers the jurisdiction of the court. It's the thing that says you are removable and you have to leave the country.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, the -- the -- the  -- the -- the jurisdictional provision, I guess, is 1252 itself, right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I  -- I think that's correct, yes.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  And that says judicial review of a final order of removal.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  Correct.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  So the action there is the final order of removal?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  Correct.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  And the final order of removal is based on the denial of the application for adjustment of status?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  It is based on the denial of the application for adjustment of status. But, as this Court said in Nasrallah, there is a distinction between the basis for the final order of removal and the final order of removal itself.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but the final order of removal is the action, right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  The final order of removal is the action. And I think that's consistent with this Court's precedents. I mean, this Court has said that the action is the thing that triggers the jurisdiction of the court, and that is the final order of removal.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, that's not what you said in your brief. In your brief, you said the action is the thing that initiates the case.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I  -- I -- I think that's correct. I think the final order of removal is the thing that initiates the case. And I think that's consistent with what this Court has said in its precedents, that the final order of removal is the thing that initiates the case. And I think that's because, if you look at Section 1252, it says that the court of appeals has jurisdiction over a petition for review of any final order of removal. And so I think that that is the thing that initiates the case.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, the final order of removal is what initiates the case, but that's not the action, right?  I mean, the action is the denial of the application for adjustment of status.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I  -- I disagree with that, that the denial of the application for adjustment of status is the action. I think that the final order of removal is the action that initiates the case. And I think that's consistent with this Court's precedents, which have said that the action is the thing that triggers the jurisdiction of the court. And so I think that that's the final order of removal.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, the -- you seem to have a circular argument here, and I'm trying to figure out how to break the circle. You seem to argue that the final order of removal is the action, but then you also argue that the final order of removal is discretionary. So what is the action?  Is it the denial of adjustment of status, or is it the final order of removal?  I think you answered that question, but I'm trying to figure out how that works.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So we think that the final order of removal is the action, and that's because it's the final order of removal that initiates the case. And I think that that's consistent with this Court's precedents. And I think that's also consistent with the text of 1252, which says that the court of appeals has jurisdiction over a petition for review of any final order of removal. And so I think that that is the action. Now, I think, in addition, we think that the final order of removal is discretionary, and I think that that is consistent with the text of the INA, which says that the decision whether to grant adjustment of status is discretionary, and that's at 1255(a).<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So what's the difference between the denial of adjustment of status and the final order of removal?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that the final order of removal is the thing that actually initiates the case. It's the thing that triggers the jurisdiction of the court. And so I think that that is the action. And I think that that's consistent with this Court's precedents. And I think it's also consistent with the text of 1252, which says that the court of appeals has jurisdiction over a petition for review of any final order of removal. And so I think that that is the action that is being described.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So, if the final order of removal is discretionary, then the denial of adjustment of status is not reviewable?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  That is correct, that the denial of adjustment of status is not reviewable. And I think that's consistent with this Court's precedents, which have said that discretionary determinations are not reviewable. And I think it's also consistent with the text of the INA, which says that the decision whether to grant adjustment of status is in the discretion of the Attorney General and also in the discretion of the Secretary.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So how do you have a final order of removal that's discretionary and yet not have the denial of adjustment of status also discretionary?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that that's because the denial of adjustment of status is the basis for the final order of removal. And so, when the -- the -- the IJ issues an order saying that you are removable because you were inadmissible at the time you entered the country and you haven't received adjustment of status, that is the final order of removal. And that is the thing that initiates the case. That is the thing that triggers the jurisdiction of the court. And so I think that that is the action that is being described in 1252.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Thank you.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Alito.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  In your brief, you argued that a court of appeals has no authority to review an IJ's factual finding that a particular marriage is a sham, even if that finding is unsupported by substantial evidence. Is that still the  government's position?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that is correct, yes. I think that that is  --that is the government's position.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, how can that be?  If the -- if the -- the denial of the petition is based on an erroneous factual finding, then how can that be unreviewable?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  Well, I think that's because, as this Court said in Chadha, Congress can permissibly allocate review to the court of appeals and say that you can only review the final order of removal, which is the thing that actually triggers the jurisdiction of the court. And so I think that that is consistent with this Court's precedents.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, if that is true, then why should the court of appeals even have to look at the administrative record?  Why should it have to look at anything that occurred before the final order of removal?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  Well, I think that the court of appeals should look at the administrative record because that is what this Court said in  --in Falcon that the court of appeals should do. And I think that that is  --that is consistent with the fact that the court of appeals is supposed to be reviewing the final order of removal for  substantial evidence, and so it needs to look at the administrative record to do that. But I think that the -- the -- the -- the point is that the court of appeals is not supposed to be reviewing the underlying steps that led to the final order of removal. It's only supposed to be reviewing the final order of removal itself.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Thank you.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Sotomayor.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Counsel, I -- I'm still trying to figure out the  answer to Justice Thomas's question. If the IJ's order is reviewable, is it not reviewable for substantial evidence, or is it reviewable for legal error, and what legal error would that be?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  So I think that the final order of removal is reviewable for legal error and for constitutional claims. And I think that that's what this Court said in Chadha and in Mendoza and in Nasrallah, that the  -- that the court of appeals is supposed to be reviewing the final order of removal for legal error and constitutional claims.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I  --I -- I'm sorry. I don't see how you can review the final order of removal for legal error without looking at the factual underpinnings of it.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  Well, I think that you can look at the factual underpinnings, but I think that the -- the -- the point is that the court of appeals is not supposed to be reviewing the factual underpinnings for substantial evidence. And I think that that's consistent with this Court's precedents, which have said that the  -- the court of appeals is supposed to be reviewing the final order of removal for legal error and for constitutional claims.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, what's the legal error that the court can review?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that the court can review legal errors, such as, for example, the application of an impermissible burden-shifting framework, which is what the court below did in this case. I think that the court can review legal errors, such as the misinterpretation of the regulations. I think that the court can review legal errors, such as the application of an impermissible extrastatutory factor, which is what the court did in Nasrallah. And so I think that there are a number of legal errors that the court of appeals can review even in the context of a final order of removal.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But it can't review the factual basis for the denial of the adjustment of status?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  That is correct, that the court of appeals cannot review the factual basis for the denial of adjustment of status.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if there was no marriage at all, the court can't review that?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  That is correct, that the court cannot review that. And I think that that's consistent with this Court's precedents, which have said that the court of appeals is supposed to be reviewing the final order of removal for legal error and constitutional claims. And I think that that's also consistent with the INA, which says that judicial review is limited to the final order of removal. And so I think that that is the only thing that the court of appeals is supposed to be reviewing.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And it can't review the legal basis for the denial of adjustment of status?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E.","cleaned":"        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Counsel, I'd like to ask you the same question I asked your friend. Do you agree that the  --the Petitioner has a liberty interest in being considered for adjustment of status?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  We do not agree that he has a liberty interest in being considered for adjustment of status. And the reason for that is because adjustment of status is a discretionary determination. And that's not just a discretionary determination for the Attorney General; it's also a discretionary determination for the Secretary. And so, when you have a discretionary determination, that is not the sort of thing that you can have a liberty interest in. And the reason for that is because, when you have a liberty interest, you have a due process right to notice and a hearing. And so, if you had a liberty interest in adjustment of status, that would mean that you would be entitled to a hearing on your application for adjustment of status. And that is not the sort of thing that the INA provides for.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, what if you're -- what if the -- the ground for denial of adjustment of status is that the person is a member of a gang?  Do you think he has a liberty interest in that determination?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I do not think he has a liberty interest in that determination. I think that's a discretionary determination as well. And I think that's consistent with this Court's decision in Mandel, where it said that the  --the fact that the government is acting in its exercise of consular functions, which is what it is doing when it's determining whether to grant adjustment of status, that that is not the sort of thing that is subject to judicial review. And so I think that's  --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, that's because it's a consular function. I mean, that's a totally different context. But, here, the -- the denial of the application for adjustment of status is based on a factual ground, right, he's a member of a gang, and he says, no, I'm not. And you're saying that he has no liberty interest in that determination?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  That is correct. I think that that is a discretionary determination. And I think that's what this Court said in Romero, that the  -- the denial of discretionary relief is not the sort of thing that triggers procedural due process.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but it's not  -- it's not discretionary whether he's a member of a gang or not, right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  It's not discretionary whether he's a member of a gang or not, but it is discretionary whether to grant adjustment of status to someone who is a member of a gang. And so that is the discretionary determination that's being made. And so, for example, if you had a gang member who came forward and said, I have repented, I am no longer a gang member, I want to cooperate with law enforcement, the government could, in its discretion, say, you know what, we're going to give you adjustment of status because you're cooperating with us. But, if instead that person said, no, I'm still an active gang member and I'm proud of it, then the government is not going to give adjustment of status to that person. And so that is a discretionary determination that is being made. And I think that's consistent with this Court's precedents, that discretionary determinations are not the sort of thing that trigger procedural due process.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Counsel, you said in your brief that Petitioner's argument would \"muddle\" the distinction between a judgment and an action. And I -- I want to give you a chance to expand on that. What is the distinction between a judgment and an action?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E.

Roberts, Jr.:  So the action there is the final order of removal?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  Correct.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G.

And I think that that's what this Court said in Chadha and in Mendoza and in Nasrallah, that the  -- that the court of appeals is supposed to be reviewing the final order of removal for legal error and constitutional claims.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I  --I -- I'm sorry. I don't see how you can review the final order of removal for legal error without looking at the factual underpinnings of it.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  Well, I think that you can look at the factual underpinnings, but I think that the -- the -- the point is that the court of appeals is not supposed to be reviewing the factual underpinnings for substantial evidence. And I think that that's consistent with this Court's precedents, which have said that the  -- the court of appeals is supposed to be reviewing the final order of removal for legal error and for constitutional claims.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  Well, what's the legal error that the court can review?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I think that the court can review legal errors, such as, for example, the application of an impermissible burden-shifting framework, which is what the court below did in this case. I think that the court can review legal errors, such as the misinterpretation of the regulations. I think that the court can review legal errors, such as the application of an impermissible extrastatutory factor, which is what the court did in Nasrallah. And so I think that there are a number of legal errors that the court of appeals can review even in the context of a final order of removal.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  But it can't review the factual basis for the denial of the adjustment of status?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  That is correct, that the court of appeals cannot review the factual basis for the denial of adjustment of status.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So, if there was no marriage at all, the court can't review that?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  That is correct, that the court cannot review that. And I think that that's consistent with this Court's precedents, which have said that the court of appeals is supposed to be reviewing the final order of removal for legal error and constitutional claims. And I think that that's also consistent with the INA, which says that judicial review is limited to the final order of removal. And so I think that that is the only thing that the court of appeals is supposed to be reviewing.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And it can't review the legal basis for the denial of adjustment of status?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E.","parsed":["Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Counsel, I'd like to ask you the same question I asked your friend. Do you agree that the  --the Petitioner has a liberty interest in being considered for adjustment of status?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  We do not agree that he has a liberty interest in being considered for adjustment of status. And the reason for that is because adjustment of status is a discretionary determination. And that's not just a discretionary determination for the Attorney General; it's also a discretionary determination for the Secretary. And so, when you have a discretionary determination, that is not the sort of thing that you can have a liberty interest in. And the reason for that is because, when you have a liberty interest, you have a due process right to notice and a hearing. And so, if you had a liberty interest in adjustment of status, that would mean that you would be entitled to a hearing on your application for adjustment of status. And that is not the sort of thing that the INA provides for.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, what if you're -- what if the -- the ground for denial of adjustment of status is that the person is a member of a gang?  Do you think he has a liberty interest in that determination?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  I do not think he has a liberty interest in that determination. I think that's a discretionary determination as well. And I think that's consistent with this Court's decision in Mandel, where it said that the  --the fact that the government is acting in its exercise of consular functions, which is what it is doing when it's determining whether to grant adjustment of status, that that is not the sort of thing that is subject to judicial review. And so I think that's  --<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, that's because it's a consular function. I mean, that's a totally different context. But, here, the -- the denial of the application for adjustment of status is based on a factual ground, right, he's a member of a gang, and he says, no, I'm not. And you're saying that he has no liberty interest in that determination?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  That is correct. I think that that is a discretionary determination. And I think that's what this Court said in Romero, that the  -- the denial of discretionary relief is not the sort of thing that triggers procedural due process.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Well, but it's not  -- it's not discretionary whether he's a member of a gang or not, right?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  It's not discretionary whether he's a member of a gang or not, but it is discretionary whether to grant adjustment of status to someone who is a member of a gang. And so that is the discretionary determination that's being made. And so, for example, if you had a gang member who came forward and said, I have repented, I am no longer a gang member, I want to cooperate with law enforcement, the government could, in its discretion, say, you know what, we're going to give you adjustment of status because you're cooperating with us. But, if instead that person said, no, I'm still an active gang member and I'm proud of it, then the government is not going to give adjustment of status to that person. And so that is a discretionary determination that is being made. And I think that's consistent with this Court's precedents, that discretionary determinations are not the sort of thing that trigger procedural due process.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Counsel, you said in your brief that Petitioner's argument would \"muddle\" the distinction between a judgment and an action. And I -- I want to give you a chance to expand on that. What is the distinction between a judgment and an action?<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak:  The distinction between a judgment and an action is that an action is the thing that triggers the jurisdiction of the court. So it's the complaint that is filed that says I am bringing this claim against you. A judgment, on the other hand, is the court's determination of the rights and liabilities of the parties. And so, in this context, the judgment is the final order of removal. And so the -- the -- the action is the thing that starts the case. It's the thing that triggers the jurisdiction of the court. And that's what's being described in 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). And so that's why we think that that provision is referring to the final order of removal and not to any other determination that might be made in the course of the case.<\/START_Q>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G.

Alito, Jr.\n        Opening Statement: <speaker>Ephraim McDowell<\/speaker><text> Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The DSH provision is designed to compensate hospitals for serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients. And in the Medicare fraction, Congress used a patient's entitlement to SSI benefits as a proxy for determining whether the patient is low income. SSI benefits are monthly cash payments made by SSA when a person meets eligibility requirements in a particular month, including the requirement of having low income in that month. Thus, as HHS has consistently recognized since Congress enacted the Medicare fraction, a person is entitled to SSI benefits only when he satisfies the requirements for a cash payment during the month of his hospital stay. That interpretation is fully consistent with the one this Court upheld in Empire Health. The Medica re fraction uses two distinct phrases, \"entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A\" and \"entitled to SSI benefits under Title XVI.\"  And while the word \"entitled\" means the same thing within both phrases, benefits under Medicare Part A are fundamentally distinct from SSI benefits under Title XVI. Petitioners claim that a person is entitled to SSI benefits even if he is not owed a cash payment during the month of his hospital  stay so long as he received at least a single cash payment sometime within the year prior to his hospital stay. But SSI benefits are monthly cash paymen ts. So, if a person is not entitled to the cash payment in a particular month, he's simply not entitled to SSI benefits in that month. Petitioners also claim that SSI benefits under Title XVI include not only cash payments but also certain non-cash benefits. But those non-cash benefits are not supplemental security income benefits because they are not cash payments made by SSA, nor are they provided under Title XVI. Ultimately, Petitioners would routinely count patients as low income even though they are earning too much income to be entitled to an SSI benefit. That approach is flatly inconsistent with Congress's choice of SSI entitlement as the proxy for low-income status. I welcome the Court's questions.<\/text>\n\n        ### Output:\n    ","justice":"Justice Samuel A.

SSI benefits are monthly cash payments made by SSA when a person meets eligibility requirements in a particular month, including the requirement of having low income in that month. Thus, as HHS has consistently recognized since Congress enacted the Medicare fraction, a person is entitled to SSI benefits only when he satisfies the requirements for a cash payment during the month of his hospital stay. That interpretation is fully consistent with the one this Court upheld in Empire Health. The Medica re fraction uses two distinct phrases, \"entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A\" and \"entitled to SSI benefits under Title XVI.\"  And while the word \"entitled\" means the same thing within both phrases, benefits under Medicare Part A are fundamentally distinct from SSI benefits under Title XVI. Petitioners claim that a person is entitled to SSI benefits even if he is not owed a cash payment during the month of his hospital  stay so long as he received at least a single cash payment sometime within the year prior to his hospital stay. But SSI benefits are monthly cash paymen ts. So, if a person is not entitled to the cash payment in a particular month, he's simply not entitled to SSI benefits in that month. Petitioners also claim that SSI benefits under Title XVI include not only cash payments but also certain non-cash benefits. But those non-cash benefits are not supplemental security income benefits because they are not cash payments made by SSA, nor are they provided under Title XVI. Ultimately, Petitioners would routinely count patients as low income even though they are earning too much income to be entitled to an SSI benefit. That approach is flatly inconsistent with Congress's choice of SSI entitlement as the proxy for low-income status.

Yet the government insists that the statute not only requires nothing that wasn't already required by Section (a) before 2002 but also requires the one thing we know Congress didn't want. Under its view, the Veterans Court does not even look at the agency's benefit-of-the -doubt rulings unless a -- so long as no factual finding specifically challenged by the veteran is infected with clear error. That is also what the Veterans Court and the Federal Circuit held in these cases. Their decisions render Congress's statutory amendment entirely superfluous. They mean that  a uniquely generous standard of proof is reviewed in a uniquely ungenerous way. And, if  upheld, they will allow the agency's non-compliance with its statutory mandate to continue unchecked. I welcome the Court's questions.<\/text>\n\n        ### Output:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Ms. Bostwick, the first question is whether this provision is jurisdictional, and I think you agree that it is not jurisdictional in the sense that it deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction. So we're left with the question of whether it is jurisdictional in the sense that it is mandatory and subject to a strict harmless error standard. You say that it is not jurisdictional in that sense. So what is the harmless error standard that would apply?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, I mean, what would be the standard?  I mean, it's not harmless error, right?  It's not the -- the standard that would apply under 52(a) or under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. What would be the standard?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A.

I mean, that's the statutory provision. But what would the court say?  What would the court say?  This is a question of law. It's a question of statutory interpretation. We think that the court is required to do X. So what would X be?  What would the court say?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A.

It takes due account of the Secretary's application of it, and it does so in making the determinations under subsection (a). Those textual clues point to standard principles of judicial review of agency action. That is, the Veterans Cour t reviews legal aspects of the Secretary's application of 5107(b) de novo and factual aspects deferentially, here, for clear error. The Secretary's determination that all the evidence in the record on a particular issue is or is not an approximate balance is itself factual or predominantly factual and  so should be reviewed for clear error. Now what I heard my friend say this morning and the reason Petitioners resist that fairly obvious conclusion, I think, is because they observe that everything I just said could have been inferred from subsection (a) itself. And so that leaves subsection (b)(1) with no additional work to do. But, when Congress enacted (b)(1) in 2002, it took what was implicit or just generally covered in (a) and made it explicit and specific. It put an exclamation point on it. That's not nothing. Think of the Tenth Amendment, for example. But, even if you think that our interpretation renders (b)(1) largely redundant, it's still better than the alternative that Petitioners offer you. Petitioners say that the approximate balance finding should be reviewed de novo. But  that creates needless contradictions in the text. It conflicts with the express standard of review Congress supplied in (a)(4). It's in  serious tension with the prohibition on trial de novo in subsection (c). It's a real divergence from standard principles of judicial review generally and judicial review of agency decisions more specifically. And it's even inconsistent with the way other factual issues under (b)(1) are reviewed, as my friend mentioned this morning, like the in-service connection or existence of a disability. If Congress intended that highly irregular result, I think the language in (b)(1) is an awfully cryptic way of going about it. So, as between two interpretations, one that's sort of consistent, coherent, with a little bit of redundancy, and one that eliminates the redundancy at the cost of a statute at war with itself, I think you should pick the former over the latter.

I mean, we're not talking about statutory language. We're talking about the absence of statutory language. So what would it be based on?  Would it be based on the fact that this is a unique statute and a unique body?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I -- I think that's right. I think the fact that this is a unique statute and a unique body, I think, is a factor that would be relevant in sort of figuring out the background principles of judicial review. But, again, I don't think that's enough to get you to the fairly dramatic departure that Petitioners' position would require.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Well, what would be enough?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I -- I think the statutory language would be enough, but it would have to be a lot clearer than it is here.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  What would that look like?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think it would look like the language that the Court used in Kisor, which is, when you're reviewing an agency's interpretation of its own regulations, you should give it a measure of deference, so long as it's reasonable, so long as it's not inconsistent with the regulation itself. And so, when you have that kind of language, that's a pretty clear indication that Congress intended something different. But, again, even if you thought that, I mean, there's a lot of room between that and the sort of trial de novo standard that Petitioners are asking for.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So what is the difference between the standard that you're arguing for and the de novo standard that you're resisting?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So the de novo standard that they're resisting is a trial de novo standard. It's not just de novo legal review. It's de novo review of fact and law. It's trial de novo. And so that's a pretty significant departure from the normal standard of judicial review, which is deferential review of factual determinations by the agency.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Well, I think that's what you normally get in a court of review. You normally get de novo review.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  De novo legal review, that's correct.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Well, what's the difference between the de novo review that you normally get in a court of review and what you're arguing for here?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So, again, it's de novo review of legal questions, and it's deferential review of factual determinations. And so, in this context, that means that the Veterans Court is going to have to give the Board's determination that the evidence is in approximate balance the same kind of deference that it would give any other factual determination by the Board. Now, if the Board --<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So what's the difference between that and de novo review?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Well, again, it's that it's deferential. It's not a trial de novo standard. It's not -- it's not saying, you know, we're going to look at the evidence and we're going to make our own determination as to whether or not the evidence is in approximate balance. It's saying we're going to look at the evidence, and we're going to defer to the Board's determination so long as it's not clearly erroneous.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So, if you have a -- if you have a 50\/50 tie, what do you do?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So, if you have a 50\/50 tie, that is a determination for the Board to make, and if the Board says, I think it's in approximate balance, we think that that's entitled to deference so long as it's not clearly erroneous. Now, if the Board --<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Well, let's just say it's 50\/50.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So, if it's 50\/50, then -- then it's -- then it's entitled to deference. Now, if the Board provides no explanation, if the Board says nothing, well, then, you know, that's a legal question for the Veterans Court. But, if the Board --<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  No, I know, but that's --<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  -- explains it, then it's entitled to deference.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  But I think you're just -- you're begging the question. The -- the point is that you have a tie. You have 50\/50. You have equipoise. And under your view, what do you do with that?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So, under our view, that is a determination for the Board to make. And if the Board says, I think, under the circumstances, although it's 50\/50, I think that that means that the evidence is in approximate balance, that's entitled to deference.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So you would say it's not in approximate balance?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  No, I'm saying that that's a determination for the Board to make.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Well, that's --<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  And if the Board says --<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  I mean, that's what I'm trying to get at.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Right. So, if the Board says, I think, under the circumstances, this is in approximate balance, then that's entitled to deference.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So you would say that 50\/50 is in approximate balance?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I would say that that's a determination for the Board to make, and if the Board makes it, then it's entitled to deference.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  No, I know, but I'm just trying to get your answer.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I don't have an answer.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  You don't have an answer?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I don't have an answer.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So, if it's 50\/50 --<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  It's a factual question.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  -- you don't know whether or not it's in approximate balance?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  It's a factual question that the Board will answer. And if the Board says, under the circumstances, we think that that is in approximate balance, then that's entitled to deference.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So what are the circumstances that would provide you --<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Well, the Board will tell you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  No, I mean, you -- you have been thinking about this case.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  You're participating in this case.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So, if it's 50\/50, what would you think would be in approximate balance?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So, again, I think that's a determination for the Board to make. And if the Board says, under the circumstances, we think that that is in approximate balance, then that's entitled to deference.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So you can't think of any circumstances?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I can't think of any circumstances, but, again, that's because I think that that's a determination for the Board to make in the first instance.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So the -- the -- the -- the standard that you're suggesting is that it's not clear error for the Board to say, if it's 50\/50, that it's in approximate balance?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think that's right, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Okay. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Breyer?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Stephen G. Breyer:  I -- I -- I'd like to know what you think of this. I mean, it's a little bit different question, but, basically, you've heard what's been said, and you have to decide it. And I -- I thought that the -- the question that we were deciding was, is there a special standard of review that applies to this kind of situation?  And I thought the answer to that, yes, there is a special standard of review. It's a special standard of review because, when the agency makes a finding of fact, that is a question of law, whether they're reasonable, and you review it de novo. Now, if you want to add the word \"reasonableness,\" you can, but I don't know why you have to. But that's what I thought the question was. Am I wrong about that?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So I think that's right insofar as the question presented goes, but I think that the -- the amicus's position is that the Board's determination that the evidence is in approximate balance is itself a legal determination, and, therefore, subject to de novo review, full stop. And I think that that is incorrect because I think that that is a predominantly factual determination.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Stephen G. Breyer:  I see. So -- so what you're saying is, if you read the statute, you will find that the agency's determination that the evidence is in equipoise is a factual determination?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think that's right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Stephen G. Breyer:  Is that right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think that's right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Stephen G. Breyer:  All right. If you read the statute, you will find that the agency's determination that the evidence is in equipoise is a factual determination. Is that what you just said?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think that's right, yes.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Stephen G. Breyer:  Okay. Now suppose you read the statute and you find that the agency's determination that the evidence is in equipoise is a legal determination. Then what?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Then I think it's subject to de novo review, but I don't think the statute says that.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Stephen G. Breyer:  No, I know you don't think it says that. I'm just trying to get this straight in my mind. All right. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Alito?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Suppose that the Secretary -- suppose that the Board makes a decision and the Board says, we are not going to provide our reasons. We just think that the evidence is in equipoise. Would that be reviewable at all?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I -- I think that probably would be reviewable, and the reason is that that is a legal determination, right?  That's the Board saying, I'm not going to state a premise. And so, if you don't state a premise, then you're not really making a factual determination. You're making a legal determination. And I think that that would be reviewable. And the -- the legal standard would be, did the Board have to state its premise?  And the answer is yes, it did.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, it's reviewable for what purpose?  To see whether they were right about the fact that they didn't have to provide the reasons?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's right. That's right. I think that's exactly right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And if they were wrong about that, then what?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Then the Veterans Court would have to remand to have them state their premise.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And if they were right about that, then what?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Then the -- then the Veterans Court would say, well, you know, you don't have to state your premise, but, in this case, you did, and so we're going to affirm.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Sotomayor?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm a little confused. I thought that the Board always had to give reasons.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So how could they ever say we're not going to provide reasons?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's right. So I -- I -- I think that that would be legal error, right?  I think that that would be legal error on the part of the Board.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let me ask you this. I'm assuming that the reason why we're here is because there are mixed questions of law and fact, correct?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And that's what we're fighting about, how much of it is mixed?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And how much of it is factual?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, in your view, when the Board makes a credibility determination, that's a factual finding?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's a factual finding.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. When it makes a determination that something is a current condition, is that a factual or legal determination?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think that's a factual determination.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  It is?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think it's a factual determination.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  How about the nexus between the condition and the military service?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think that's a factual determination as well.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And how about the nexus between the condition and the service-connected disability?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Same thing. I think that's a factual determination.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And how about the severity of the disability?  Is that a factual or legal question?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think that's a factual determination.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, basically, you're saying everything is factual.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think that's right. I think that the -- the -- the application of the statutory standard, the application of the regulatory standard, is a factual determination. And I think that the only legal questions that would be available in -- in this context are, for example, was there a particular piece of evidence that was impermissible to rely on?  Did the Board rely on impermissible evidence?  That would be a legal question. Did the Board provide sufficient","cleaned":"        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Mr. Joshi, in -- in -- the -- in the absence of any statutory language, would the Veterans Court be reviewing the decision of the Board for clear error?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think it would be reviewing it for clear error, yes, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  And if you were to review it de novo, wouldn't that be a change from the normal standard of review?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Yes, Your Honor, it would be.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  And what would that be based on?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  It would be based on the statutory language, but, as I said, I think that's a pretty cryptic way of going about it.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Well, I don't -- it's not -- it's not a statutory language. I mean, we're not talking about statutory language. We're talking about the absence of statutory language. So what would it be based on?  Would it be based on the fact that this is a unique statute and a unique body?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I -- I think that's right. I think the fact that this is a unique statute and a unique body, I think, is a factor that would be relevant in sort of figuring out the background principles of judicial review. But, again, I don't think that's enough to get you to the fairly dramatic departure that Petitioners' position would require.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Well, what would be enough?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I -- I think the statutory language would be enough, but it would have to be a lot clearer than it is here.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  What would that look like?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think it would look like the language that the Court used in Kisor, which is, when you're reviewing an agency's interpretation of its own regulations, you should give it a measure of deference, so long as it's reasonable, so long as it's not inconsistent with the regulation itself. And so, when you have that kind of language, that's a pretty clear indication that Congress intended something different. But, again, even if you thought that, I mean, there's a lot of room between that and the sort of trial de novo standard that Petitioners are asking for.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So what is the difference between the standard that you're arguing for and the de novo standard that you're resisting?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So the de novo standard that they're resisting is a trial de novo standard. It's not just de novo legal review. It's de novo review of fact and law. It's trial de novo. And so that's a pretty significant departure from the normal standard of judicial review, which is deferential review of factual determinations by the agency.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Well, I think that's what you normally get in a court of review. You normally get de novo review.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  De novo legal review, that's correct.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Well, what's the difference between the de novo review that you normally get in a court of review and what you're arguing for here?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So, again, it's de novo review of legal questions, and it's deferential review of factual determinations. And so, in this context, that means that the Veterans Court is going to have to give the Board's determination that the evidence is in approximate balance the same kind of deference that it would give any other factual determination by the Board. Now, if the Board --<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So what's the difference between that and de novo review?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Well, again, it's that it's deferential. It's not a trial de novo standard. It's not -- it's not saying, you know, we're going to look at the evidence and we're going to make our own determination as to whether or not the evidence is in approximate balance. It's saying we're going to look at the evidence, and we're going to defer to the Board's determination so long as it's not clearly erroneous.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So, if you have a -- if you have a 50\/50 tie, what do you do?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So, if you have a 50\/50 tie, that is a determination for the Board to make, and if the Board says, I think it's in approximate balance, we think that that's entitled to deference so long as it's not clearly erroneous. Now, if the Board --<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Well, let's just say it's 50\/50.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So, if it's 50\/50, then -- then it's -- then it's entitled to deference. Now, if the Board provides no explanation, if the Board says nothing, well, then, you know, that's a legal question for the Veterans Court. But, if the Board --<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  No, I know, but that's --<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  -- explains it, then it's entitled to deference.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  But I think you're just -- you're begging the question. The -- the point is that you have a tie. You have 50\/50. You have equipoise. And under your view, what do you do with that?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So, under our view, that is a determination for the Board to make. And if the Board says, I think, under the circumstances, although it's 50\/50, I think that that means that the evidence is in approximate balance, that's entitled to deference.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So you would say it's not in approximate balance?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  No, I'm saying that that's a determination for the Board to make.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Well, that's --<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  And if the Board says --<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  I mean, that's what I'm trying to get at.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Right. So, if the Board says, I think, under the circumstances, this is in approximate balance, then that's entitled to deference.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So you would say that 50\/50 is in approximate balance?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I would say that that's a determination for the Board to make, and if the Board makes it, then it's entitled to deference.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  No, I know, but I'm just trying to get your answer.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I don't have an answer.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  You don't have an answer?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I don't have an answer.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So, if it's 50\/50 --<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  It's a factual question.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  -- you don't know whether or not it's in approximate balance?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  It's a factual question that the Board will answer. And if the Board says, under the circumstances, we think that that is in approximate balance, then that's entitled to deference.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So what are the circumstances that would provide you --<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Well, the Board will tell you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  No, I mean, you -- you have been thinking about this case.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  You're participating in this case.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So, if it's 50\/50, what would you think would be in approximate balance?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So, again, I think that's a determination for the Board to make. And if the Board says, under the circumstances, we think that that is in approximate balance, then that's entitled to deference.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So you can't think of any circumstances?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I can't think of any circumstances, but, again, that's because I think that that's a determination for the Board to make in the first instance.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  So the -- the -- the -- the standard that you're suggesting is that it's not clear error for the Board to say, if it's 50\/50, that it's in approximate balance?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think that's right, Your Honor.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Clarence Thomas:  Okay. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Breyer?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Stephen G. Breyer:  I -- I -- I'd like to know what you think of this. I mean, it's a little bit different question, but, basically, you've heard what's been said, and you have to decide it. And I -- I thought that the -- the question that we were deciding was, is there a special standard of review that applies to this kind of situation?  And I thought the answer to that, yes, there is a special standard of review. It's a special standard of review because, when the agency makes a finding of fact, that is a question of law, whether they're reasonable, and you review it de novo. Now, if you want to add the word \"reasonableness,\" you can, but I don't know why you have to. But that's what I thought the question was. Am I wrong about that?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  So I think that's right insofar as the question presented goes, but I think that the -- the amicus's position is that the Board's determination that the evidence is in approximate balance is itself a legal determination, and, therefore, subject to de novo review, full stop. And I think that that is incorrect because I think that that is a predominantly factual determination.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Stephen G. Breyer:  I see. So -- so what you're saying is, if you read the statute, you will find that the agency's determination that the evidence is in equipoise is a factual determination?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think that's right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Stephen G. Breyer:  Is that right?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think that's right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Stephen G. Breyer:  All right. If you read the statute, you will find that the agency's determination that the evidence is in equipoise is a factual determination. Is that what you just said?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think that's right, yes.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Stephen G. Breyer:  Okay. Now suppose you read the statute and you find that the agency's determination that the evidence is in equipoise is a legal determination. Then what?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Then I think it's subject to de novo review, but I don't think the statute says that.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Stephen G. Breyer:  No, I know you don't think it says that. I'm just trying to get this straight in my mind. All right. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Alito?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Suppose that the Secretary -- suppose that the Board makes a decision and the Board says, we are not going to provide our reasons. We just think that the evidence is in equipoise. Would that be reviewable at all?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I -- I think that probably would be reviewable, and the reason is that that is a legal determination, right?  That's the Board saying, I'm not going to state a premise. And so, if you don't state a premise, then you're not really making a factual determination. You're making a legal determination. And I think that that would be reviewable. And the -- the legal standard would be, did the Board have to state its premise?  And the answer is yes, it did.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, it's reviewable for what purpose?  To see whether they were right about the fact that they didn't have to provide the reasons?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's right. That's right. I think that's exactly right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And if they were wrong about that, then what?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Then the Veterans Court would have to remand to have them state their premise.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And if they were right about that, then what?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Then the -- then the Veterans Court would say, well, you know, you don't have to state your premise, but, in this case, you did, and so we're going to affirm.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Thank you.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Sotomayor?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  I'm a little confused. I thought that the Board always had to give reasons.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So how could they ever say we're not going to provide reasons?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's right. So I -- I -- I think that that would be legal error, right?  I think that that would be legal error on the part of the Board.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let me ask you this. I'm assuming that the reason why we're here is because there are mixed questions of law and fact, correct?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And that's what we're fighting about, how much of it is mixed?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And how much of it is factual?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's right.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, in your view, when the Board makes a credibility determination, that's a factual finding?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  That's a factual finding.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. When it makes a determination that something is a current condition, is that a factual or legal determination?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think that's a factual determination.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  It is?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think it's a factual determination.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  How about the nexus between the condition and the military service?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think that's a factual determination as well.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And how about the nexus between the condition and the service-connected disability?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  Same thing. I think that's a factual determination.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And how about the severity of the disability?  Is that a factual or legal question?<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think that's a factual determination.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, basically, you're saying everything is factual.<\/text>\n        <START_Q> Sopan Joshi:  I think that's right. I think that the -- the -- the application of the statutory standard, the application of the regulatory standard, is a factual determination. And I think that the only legal questions that would be available in -- in this context are, for example, was there a particular piece of evidence that was impermissible to rely on?  Did the Board rely on impermissible evidence?  That would be a legal question. Did the Board provide sufficient","parsed":["Justice Clarence Thomas:  Mr. Joshi, in -- in -- the -- in the absence of any statutory language, would the Veterans Court be reviewing the decision of the Board for clear error?","Sopan Joshi:  I think it would be reviewing it for clear error, yes, Your Honor.","Justice Clarence Thomas:  And if you were to review it de novo, wouldn't that be a change from the normal standard of review?","Sopan Joshi:  Yes, Your Honor, it would be.","Justice Clarence Thomas:  And what would that be based on?","Sopan Joshi:  It would be based on the statutory language, but, as I said, I think that's a pretty cryptic way of going about it.","Justice Clarence Thomas:  Well, I don't -- it's not -- it's not a statutory language.

So, basically, you're saying everything is factual."],"unique_questions":["Justice Clarence Thomas:  Well, I don't -- it's not -- it's not a statutory language. I mean, we're not talking about statutory language. We're talking about the absence of statutory language. So what would it be based on?  Would it be based on the fact that this is a unique statute and a unique body?","Justice Clarence Thomas:  So what are the circumstances that would provide you --","Justice Clarence Thomas:  You're participating in this case.","Justice Clarence Thomas:  So you can't think of any circumstances?","Justice Stephen G.

Thank you.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  How about the nexus between the condition and the military service?","Sopan Joshi:  So, if you have a 50\/50 tie, that is a determination for the Board to make, and if the Board says, I think it's in approximate balance, we think that that's entitled to deference so long as it's not clearly erroneous. Now, if the Board --","Sopan Joshi:  Same thing. I think that's a factual determination.","Sopan Joshi:  Well, again, it's that it's deferential. It's not a trial de novo standard. It's not -- it's not saying, you know, we're going to look at the evidence and we're going to make our own determination as to whether or not the evidence is in approximate balance. It's saying we're going to look at the evidence, and we're going to defer to the Board's determination so long as it's not clearly erroneous.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  So how could they ever say we're not going to provide reasons?","Justice Stephen G. Breyer:  I -- I -- I'd like to know what you think of this. I mean, it's a little bit different question, but, basically, you've heard what's been said, and you have to decide it. And I -- I thought that the -- the question that we were deciding was, is there a special standard of review that applies to this kind of situation?  And I thought the answer to that, yes, there is a special standard of review. It's a special standard of review because, when the agency makes a finding of fact, that is a question of law, whether they're reasonable, and you review it de novo. Now, if you want to add the word \"reasonableness,\" you can, but I don't know why you have to. But that's what I thought the question was. Am I wrong about that?","Justice Stephen G. Breyer:  All right. If you read the statute, you will find that the agency's determination that the evidence is in equipoise is a factual determination. Is that what you just said?","Sopan Joshi:  I would say that that's a determination for the Board to make, and if the Board makes it, then it's entitled to deference.","Justice Clarence Thomas:  Well, let's just say it's 50\/50.","Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Sotomayor?","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  And that's what we're fighting about, how much of it is mixed?","Justice Clarence Thomas:  So, if it's 50\/50 --","Sopan Joshi:  That's a factual finding.","Justice Clarence Thomas:  Well, what's the difference between the de novo review that you normally get in a court of review and what you're arguing for here?","Justice Clarence Thomas:  Okay. Thank you.","Justice Clarence Thomas:  -- you don't know whether or not it's in approximate balance?","Sopan Joshi:  So, again, it's de novo review of legal questions, and it's deferential review of factual determinations. And so, in this context, that means that the Veterans Court is going to have to give the Board's determination that the evidence is in approximate balance the same kind of deference that it would give any other factual determination by the Board. Now, if the Board --","Sopan Joshi:  I think it's a factual determination.","Justice Clarence Thomas:  And if you were to review it de novo, wouldn't that be a change from the normal standard of review?","Sopan Joshi:  Right.","Sopan Joshi:  I can't think of any circumstances, but, again, that's because I think that that's a determination for the Board to make in the first instance.","Sopan Joshi:  It's a factual question.","Sopan Joshi:  -- explains it, then it's entitled to deference.","Justice Clarence Thomas:  Well, what would be enough?","Justice Clarence Thomas:  So you would say it's not in approximate balance?","Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  All right. Thank you.","Sopan Joshi:  I -- I think that's right. I think the fact that this is a unique statute and a unique body, I think, is a factor that would be relevant in sort of figuring out the background principles of judicial review.

Alito, Jr.:  Suppose that the Secretary -- suppose that the Board makes a decision and the Board says, we are not going to provide our reasons. We just think that the evidence is in equipoise. Would that be reviewable at all?","Sopan Joshi:  So, if it's 50\/50, then -- then it's -- then it's entitled to deference. Now, if the Board provides no explanation, if the Board says nothing, well, then, you know, that's a legal question for the Veterans Court. But, if the Board --","Justice Clarence Thomas:  No, I know, but that's --","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So let me ask you this. I'm assuming that the reason why we're here is because there are mixed questions of law and fact, correct?","Sopan Joshi:  Thank you.","Sopan Joshi:  De novo legal review, that's correct.","Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  And if they were right about that, then what?","Sopan Joshi:  Right. So, if the Board says, I think, under the circumstances, this is in approximate balance, then that's entitled to deference.","Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.:  Well, it's reviewable for what purpose?  To see whether they were right about the fact that they didn't have to provide the reasons?","Sopan Joshi:  So, under our view, that is a determination for the Board to make. And if the Board says, I think, under the circumstances, although it's 50\/50, I think that that means that the evidence is in approximate balance, that's entitled to deference.","Justice Clarence Thomas:  I mean, that's what I'm trying to get at.","Sopan Joshi:  I think it would look like the language that the Court used in Kisor, which is, when you're reviewing an agency's interpretation of its own regulations, you should give it a measure of deference, so long as it's reasonable, so long as it's not inconsistent with the regulation itself. And so, when you have that kind of language, that's a pretty clear indication that Congress intended something different. But, again, even if you thought that, I mean, there's a lot of room between that and the sort of trial de novo standard that Petitioners are asking for.","Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.:  Justice Alito?","Sopan Joshi:  That's right.","Justice Clarence Thomas:  Well, that's --","Justice Clarence Thomas:  No, I know, but I'm just trying to get your answer.","Justice Clarence Thomas:  So what is the difference between the standard that you're arguing for and the de novo standard that you're resisting?","Sopan Joshi:  I think that's right.","Sopan Joshi:  I think that's right, yes.","Justice Sonia Sotomayor:  All right. So, in your view, when the Board makes a credibility determination, that's a factual finding?","Sopan Joshi:  Well, the Board will tell you.","Justice Stephen G. Breyer:  Is that right?","Sopan Joshi:  I don't have an answer.","Justice Clarence Thomas:  You don't have an answer?","Sopan Joshi:  So I think that's right insofar as the question presented goes, but I think that the -- the amicus's position is that the Board's determination that the evidence is in approximate balance is itself a legal determination, and, therefore, subject to de novo review, full stop. And I think that that is incorrect because I think that that is a predominantly factual determination.","Justice Clarence Thomas:  And what would that be based on?","Justice Clarence Thomas:  So what's the difference between that and de novo review?","Sopan Joshi:  I -- I think that probably would be reviewable, and the reason is that that is a legal determination, right?  That's the Board saying, I'm not going to state a premise. And so, if you don't state a premise, then you're not really making a factual determination. You're making a legal determination. And I think that that would be reviewable. And the -- the legal standard would be, did the Board have to state its premise?  And the answer is yes, it did.","Justice Clarence Thomas:  Mr. Joshi, in -- in -- the -- in the absence of any statutory language, would the Veterans Court be reviewing the decision of the Board for clear error?","Sopan Joshi:  Yes, Your Honor, it would be.","Justice Stephen G.

The -- the point is that you have a tie. You have 50\/50. You have equipoise. And under your view, what do you do with that?","Sopan Joshi:  And if the Board says --","Justice Clarence Thomas:  Well, I think that's what you normally get in a court of review.
