      "FACTS_OF_THE_CASE:\n",
      "On May 11, 2006, Jose Gomez received an unsolicited text message advertising the U.S. Navy. The text message was the result of a partnership between the Navy and the Campbell-Ewald Company, a marketing consultant that the Navy hired to help with a recruiting campaign. The compilation of the list of targeted phone numbers and the actual sending of the message was outsourced to a company called Mindmatics.\n",
      "Gomez sued and argued that that Campbell-Ewald violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act by instructing or allowing a third-party vendor to send unsolicited text messages on the behalf of a client. After Campbell-Ewald's motion to dismiss was denied, the company offered Gomez a settlement, which Gomez rejected. Campbell-Ewald again moved to dismiss the case and argued that Gomez's rejection of the settlement offer made the claim moot. The district court denied the motion, and Campbell-Ewald moved for summary judgment based on the argument that the company had derivative sovereign immunity because it was acting on behalf of the government. The district court granted the motion for summary judgment. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that Campbell-Ewald was not entitled to the derivative sovereign immunity defense because the defense had only ever been applied in the context of property damage resulting from public works projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "LEGAL_QUESTION:\n",
      "(1) Does a case become moot when a plaintiff receives an offer of complete relief for his claim? If so, is the answer different when the plaintiff has asserted a class action claim but receives the offer of complete relief before any class is certified?(2) Is the doctrine of derivative sovereign immunity limited to claims arising out of property damage caused by public works projects?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_john_g_roberts_jr<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To affirm the Ninth Circuit on the first two questions presented, this Court must accept the following two propositions: First, a plaintiff can force a court to adjudicate the merits of his claim simply by refusing the defendant's offer of capitulation and complete relief. And, second, that a plaintiff has what amounts to a substantive right to class litigation that applies as soon as the complaint is filed and that entitles the case to proceed even if his individual claim drops out before --<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_antonin_scalia<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "\n",
      "I don't think so, Your Honor. The district court found that it was at page 40 of the Petition Appendix. The Ninth Circuit decided this case based on that premise. That's at page 5a of the Petition Appendix. So I think as the case comes --<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_antonin_scalia<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Do we take it on that assumption, too?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you should, Your Honor. Now -- now, they have argued below that the only reason that it wasn't for complete relief was that -- because it didn't provide for attorneys' fees. But the TCPA, the underlying statute here, does not provide for attorneys' fees.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_elena_kagan<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "But that's a merits question as to whether they're entitled to attorneys' fees. If the question is complete -- you know, \"complete relief\" means what the plaintiff has asked for. The plaintiff has asked for attorneys' fees here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think that's what \"complete relief\" means, Your Honor. I think it means that the plaintiff has received everything that he could -- that he could if he received a judgment in this -- in --<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_sonia_sotomayor<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",

So I don't see how this could be -- putting aside the class action, putting aside the attorneys' fees, those appear to me to be fairly critical liability determinations that were not made by the court below.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. First, as the case comes to the Court, I think it is accepted that the offer was for complete relief. Now let me try to answer the points that you raise. First, he's not entitled to a finding of liability. If a litigant was always entitled to a finding of liability, then essentially no case could become moot. If you take the voluntary cessation context, a litigant could always insist that he's still entitled to the finding of liability.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_anthony_m_kennedy<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "It -- it seems that you want us to write an -- an opinion saying that a settlement offer is equivalent to a judgment. And we've had cases, like the Kokkonen case, in which there was a settlement approved by the court, case dismissed, then the settlement was not performed. They went to court seeking an injunction. The court said, no, no. You have a contract. You have to file again. You have to go into a different court. You have to start all over again. A settlement offer and a settlement contract and a settlement agreement are different from a judgment, and you do not have a judgment.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Your Honor, I think that the accepted principle is that a settlement moots the case and requires the court to dispose of the case. I mean, I think that's the accepted principle. And --<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_anthony_m_kennedy<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, Your Honor, I think -- I think this case is consistent with the Kokkonen case. What the Kokkonen case recognized is that, once a case has come to an end, the Court has ancillary jurisdiction to dispose of it. In that case it dealt with the enforcement of a consent decree. Here our fundamental --<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_ruth_bader_ginsburg<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Federal rule in point, Mr. Garre -- and it says -- Rule 68 says an offer of judgment expires automatically after 14 days if it's not accepted. It is deemed withdrawn, and it cannot be used for any purpose other than to saddle the plaintiff with costs if she doesn't get more than the offer. So we have a Federal rule directly in point, and that instructs litigants what an offer of judgment means. Why do we look any further than that?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, first, Your Honor, this case, there was not only the Rule 68 offer of judgment, but a freestanding settlement offer. So we think that the mechanics of Rule 68 don't apply here. It's --<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_ruth_bader_ginsburg<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, isn't that rather an end run around the offer of judgment?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I don't -- I don't think so. I mean, it still presents the question of whether the controversy still exists given that the defendant has offered the plaintiff everything that he -- he could secure through a Federal judgment.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_ruth_bader_ginsburg<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "The plaintiff -- the plaintiff asks for class action, didn't get that because they weren't far -- far along enough for the plaintiff even to move for certification.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "And the plaintiff in Genesis Healthcare asked for a collective action. The Court found that that allegation did not --<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_ruth_bader_ginsburg<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "But the collective action is simply a device for permissive joinder. It's quite different, as Genesis recognized. Class action -- I don't remember Justice Thomas' exact words, but it's a whole different kettle of fish.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I mean, here's how I think it's different, Your Honor. You're right. It is different. But it's different in that this Court has repeatedly said that the class has no independent legal status until it's certified. And it's different in that, in Genesis Healthcare, you had a statutory right to a collective action, but the Court said that that didn't trump Article III. And here you just --<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_ruth_bader_ginsburg<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "All it -- all it is -- it's an invitation to people to join you. That's all -- all that -- it's a permissive joinder.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it was still pretty important to the plaintiff in that case, and it was a statutory right. And here the question is: When the individual claim drops out, is there any basis for the action to proceed simply so that, on the -- on the potential that a class could be certified?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_ruth_bader_ginsburg<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "One -- one is -- is that potential. The other is, it's not that I would be entitled to attorneys' fees from the loser, but if there's a class, then there are a lot of other people who will share in the attorneys' fees and I'll have to pay less.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "And that -- that's the cost-sharing argument that was made in Roper. And if I could say a couple things about that. First, the plaintiff in this case, unlike the plaintiff in Roper, never made that argument below. He never argued in favor of cost sharing. In fact, the complaint, if you look on page 21 of the Joint Appendix, touts that he has all the financial resources necessary to bring this action. Second of all, in Roper the Court relied on that interest solely for the purpose of allowing the appeal from the denial of certification when the mooting event occurred after the denial of certification. So there you had a real relation back issue. If the Court had been wrong in denying certification, then the case never would have become moot in the first place. Here, the mooting event takes place before certification. There's nothing to relate back to.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_elena_kagan<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "But if I could go back a little bit, Mr. Garre. And this is, I think, the question that Justice Scalia started with. There are a number of things that you've said, well, he asked for it, but he's not entitled to it. He asked for attorneys' fees, but he's not entitled to attorneys' fees. And he asked for an injunction or declaratory relief, and he's not entitled to that. And he asked for class certification, but he's not entitled to that, and so the case is moot. And the \"so the case is moot\" seems to me to be a non sequitur. In other words, he's asked for these things, you haven't offered these things, and there's a dispute about whether he's entitled to these things. Now, you might be completely right as to the \"He's not entitled to attorneys' fees.\" But that has to be adjudicated. You can't -- a court can't just say, Oh, you've offered complete relief, because in his view you haven't offered complete relief, and that's what the litigation is all about.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "And a court can make that determination just like a court can determine whether or not a defendant who says he's going to stop his action has truly voluntarily ceased his action.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_elena_kagan<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "A court can absolutely make that determination. But the question is does the Court make that determination in the guise of a mootness motion?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "\n",
      "Why can't it -- why can't it do that in the context of a summary judgment motion? I mean, why does it have to moot the case? Wouldn't the appropriate vehicle be a summary judgment motion in which you admit the facts that make you liable, or you concede the facts that make you liable? And then you fight about the legal questions?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "The -- the reason is, when -- when one party throws in the towel, the match is over.

      "No -- well, you're right, Your Honor. That's the Rule 68 offer. If you go on page 57a of the petition appendix, there's the freestanding settlement offer, which isn't a Rule 68 offer. The other thing about Rule 68 is it's really not designed for the situation of complete relief. It's designed for the situation where the defendant and plaintiff have to gamble, essentially, over whether or not an offer for less than complete relief is sufficient. They -- they want to settle on that basis. In this case you had a freestanding settlement offer. It provided for complete relief, and so the question is whether or not the -- the plaintiff had a personal stake in the case sufficient -- in the outcome of the case sufficient to keep this case alive. Justice Kennedy, to get back to your point about settlement. And I think what's important to recognize here is -- here's our position: When the offer of complete relief is made and when a court has determined that it is, indeed, for complete relief, then the case has to come to an end. Now, whether you say it's -- it's moot at that precise moment or whether you say it starts the ball rolling down the hill towards a dismissal or entry of judgment for the plaintiff based on the terms of the offer, the point is -- is that when the defendant has offered everything, the courts can't go ahead and expound on the law. Now, this Court has repeatedly said, when it's not necessary to decide, it's necessary not to decide. And that's the fundamental principle at stake here.

That's like the Judge Friendly decision that we cite in our reply brief. So that situation is not going to happen.

He also pointed out that the offer of complete relief in this case, in this kind of situation, puts the plaintiff in a better position than a default judgment.

      "\n",
      "But you've had to -- you had to deposit the money in an account in the name of the plaintiff.

      "That's -- that's, of course, right, Your Honor, but of course, if acceptance was the rule, then it's a little bit odd that the Court didn't mention the fact that he didn't accept it at all. The other point I wanted to make in response to Justice Sotomayor's question is: We cited a long footnote in our opening brief that has many cases recognizing this principle, and in our reply brief, we cite the holding case out of the English courts. It's an 1840 case, and that case is exactly on point, involving a situation where a claim was brought for a debt, the defendant came in and said, here's your money, and the court in that case -- the plaintiff refused to accept it. And the court in that case said it had a beholden duty to end the case, given that the -- the defendant had offered everything that the --<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_elena_kagan<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "-- plaintiff was seeking.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_elena_kagan<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "-- and this is very much along the same lines -- you know, you have an old English case. You have these three cases in the '90s, 1890s, which were really about liabilities had -- that had already been satisfied, and the court said, it's already been satisfied, payment has already been made. But there's really no history at all -- and tender offers have existed for a long, long time. There's no history at all of -- of saying that a tender offer moots a case, as opposed to the classic understanding, the common law understanding, of tender offers was that it created an incentive for parties, and that that was their purpose and that was their effect, was to incentivize parties to do something, but not to -- for -- not to provide a mechanism for a court just to throw out a case when a party decided that, for whatever reason, he thought that the tender offer was not good enough.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "So I think first -- just a quibble -- I do think there's a long-standing practice of recognizing that when the defendant has been offered everything he could secure, the case goes away. Second of all, and I think maybe more important: I mean, I would say that your dissent in Genesis Healthcare itself recognizes that acceptance can't be the rule in all cases. I mean, you recognize in the situation where the plaintiff doesn't accept for obstinacy or madness, but once you're there, you recognize that acceptance can't be the rule. And that's got to be right, because in the voluntary cessation context, we don't require the plaintiff to accept that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_elena_kagan<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Well, but I -- I said that mootness is not the appropriate remedy in that case. The appropriate remedy in a case where it's absolutely clear that -- that the -- that the defendant has given -- has offered the plaintiff everything the plaintiff has asked for, which it's not in this case, but where it's absolutely clear where the defendant has offered everything that the plaintiff himself has asked for, the appropriate thing to do, in order to prevent wasteful litigation, is not to dismiss the case for mootness but to grant judgment in favor of the plaintiff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>advocate<|end_header_id|>\n",

That's not a judgment on the merits because it's not adjudicating the claim on the merits. It's not picking a winner, not involving the Court picking a winner -- a loser -- winner, and it resolves all the hypothetical concerns that they've raised about eliminating the case before they actually have the check in hand.
