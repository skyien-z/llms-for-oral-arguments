      "Jose Lopez, a Mexican national living in South Dakota, was convicted of aiding and abetting the possession of cocaine. The crime is a felony under South Dakota law, but only a misdemeanor under the federal Controlled Substances Act.\n",
      "The Immigration and Naturalization Service began proceedings to remove Lopez from the country. Lopez applied for a cancellation of his removal, citing the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA). The INA allows an alien to avoid removal if he meets certain qualifications and has no prior \"aggravated felony\" convictions. Lopez argued that he was eligible for cancellation of his removal because his drug offense was only a misdemeanor under federal law.\n",
      "An Immigration Judge denied Lopez's request for cancellation, and the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed, on the grounds that Lopez had committed an aggravated felony. Lopez then sued the Attorney General and brought his case to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The Circuit Court affirmed the lower courts, ruling that a crime is an aggravated felony under the INA if it is a felony under either federal or state law.\n",

      "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A drug-trafficking crime is defined in 18 U.S. Code Section 924(c) as any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act or two other Federal statutes. \"Punishable\" is a key term. If that word is omitted, the remaining phrase, \"any felony under the Controlled Substances Act. \" clearly refers to felony violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The parties agree that \"punishable\" means \"subject to criminal sanctions\". So, a 924(c), is conduct that is subject to being punished under the Controlled Substances Act. State felonies are not, themselves, punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. It is not a Federal crime to violate State law. The defendant's conduct may be punishable under both Federal and State law, but a State felony is not a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_anthony_m_kennedy<|end_header_id|>\n",

But there are three additional textual indications, in addition to simply the 924(c). The first one is, there are other provisions of Section 924... (e), (g), and (k)... where Congress actually used very similar language. It referred to conduct punishable under the Controlled Substances Act or the two other statutes, or offenses under the Controlled Substances Act or the two other Federal statutes.

I think perhaps the government would say, \"Well, we're talking about offenses. \" That's a little different from a felony, but \"offenses\" is actually a broader term. I'll mention an additional statute, which was not in the appendix... 18 U.S. Code Section 3559(c)(2)(H). This provision... it's a similar provision; it defines a CSA. An additional textual indication is, it's agreed... and this Court has already said, in Gonzales against the United States, that a drug-trafficking crime under 924(c), under the criminal statute, must be a Federal crime. 924(c)(1)(A) refers to a crime that may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, and that clearly refers to a Federal crime. The definition of drug-trafficking crime, by its term, says it is for purposes of 924(c), so there is no reason why Congress would have wanted to include State felonies in a definition that applies to a Federal criminal provision that all concede applies only to Federal predicate offenses.

      "The... Justice Alito, there is an argument... it's developed in the brief of the American Bar Association... that, because illicit trafficking is the general category, that all the aggravated felonies in this category should have a trafficking component; and, therefore, the felonies punishable under the Controlled Substances Act that are \"simple possession\" offenses should not, in fact, be included. That is not an argument that we have pressed in our brief. We read the phrase to say \"illicit trafficking, including any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. \" So, I would agree with you, to the extent that if it is a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, Congress has said, by definition, that it is included in the category of illicit trafficking.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_stephen_g_breyer<|end_header_id|>\n",

Now, we think that's pretty straightforward. It has to be an offense described. So, the simple example is money laundering. It... the offense described in 18 U.S. Code Section 1956, \"money laundering\", is an aggravated felony. So, a violation of State law or of foreign law can be an aggravated felony, but only if it is the offense described in 1956. If States or a foreign government has a broader definition of \"money laundering\", that can't count, because it's not the offense described. And when you turn to a drug-trafficking crime, the way that offense is described in 101(A)(43) is... Congress picked up, in its entirety and without any modification, the definition of 924(c), a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. So, if you agree that, in the criminal statute, that means a felony violation of the Controlled Substances Act, the offense described is the felonies in the Controlled Substances Act, not the felonies in the misdemeanors.
