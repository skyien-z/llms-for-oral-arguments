{"prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a legal expert trained to simulate Supreme Court oral arguments.\n\nFACTS_OF_THE_CASE:\nATF, created in 1972, is responsible for regulating firearms under the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA). The GCA requires federal firearms licensees (FFLs) to conduct background checks, record firearm transfers, and serialize firearms when selling or transferring them. The GCA's regulation of firearms is based on the definition of \"firearm,\" which includes the \"frame or receiver.\" However, ATF's 1978 definition of \"frame or receiver\" became outdated due to changes in modern firearm design, such as the AR-15 and Glock pistols. Furthermore, the rise of privately made firearms (PMFs) or \"ghost guns\" posed challenges to law enforcement because they were not regulated under the GCA and did not require serialization. In response, ATF issued a Final Rule in 2022, updating the definitions of \"frame,\" \"receiver,\" and \"firearm\" to better capture modern firearm designs and regulate PMFs. The Final Rule took effect on August 24, 2022.\nThe respondents in this case challenged the Final Rule's redefinition of \"frame or receiver\" and \"firearm,\" arguing that it exceeded ATF's congressionally mandated authority. The district court granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs and vacated the Final Rule in its entirety. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's determination that the two provisions exceeded ATF's statutory authority.\n\nLEGAL_QUESTION:\nDid the ATF exceed its statutory authority in promulgating its Final Rule purporting to regulate so-called \"ghost guns\"?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_john_g_roberts_jr<|end_header_id|>\n\n We will hear argument first this morning in Case 23-852, Garland versus VanDerStok. General Prelogar.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>petitioner<|end_header_id|>\n\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The Gun Control Act imposes straightforward but essential requirements. Firearms sellers and manufacturers must mark their products with serial numbers, maintain sales records, and conduct background checks. The industry has followed those conditions without difficulty for more than half a century, and those basic requirements are crucial to solving gun crimes and keeping guns out of the hands of minors, felons, and domestic abusers. But, in recent years, companies like the Respondents here have tried to circumvent those requirements. They've begun selling firearms as easy -to-assemble kits and frames and receivers that require minimal work to be made functional. They've advertised the products, in their words, as \"ridiculously easy to assemble and dummy-proof\" and touted that you can go from opening the mail to have a fully functional gun  in as little as 15 minutes, no serial number, background check, or records required. Those untraceable guns are attractive to people who can't lawfully purchase them or  who plan to use them in crimes. As a result, our nation has seen an explosion in crimes committed with ghost guns. In the face of that public safety crisis, ATF promulgated this rule to underscore two points about the Gun Control Act's plain text. First, a weapon parts kit that can readily be converted to function as a gun with common tools, often in under an hour, is a covered firearm. Second, a product is a frame or receiver under the Act even if the buyer must drill a few holes or remove a few superfluous pieces of plastic to make it functional. Both of those points are consistent with how ATF has interpreted and implemented the Act across five decades and 11 different presidential administrations. Respondents now seek a sea change in the Act's scope. They claim that if a firearm isn't a hundred percent functional, if it's  missing just one hole that could be drilled in seconds and immediately assembled into a working gun, that product can be sold to anyone online  with no background check, no records, and no serial number. That contradicts the Act's plain text, and it also contradicts common sense.

First, a weapon parts kit that can readily be converted to function as a gun with common tools, often in under an hour, is a covered firearm. Second, a product is a frame or receiver under the Act even if the buyer must drill a few holes or remove a few superfluous pieces of plastic to make it functional. Both of those points are consistent with how ATF has interpreted and implemented the Act across five decades and 11 different presidential administrations. Respondents now seek a sea change in the Act's scope. They claim that if a firearm isn't a hundred percent functional, if it's  missing just one hole that could be drilled in seconds and immediately assembled into a working gun, that product can be sold to anyone online  with no background check, no records, and no serial number. That contradicts the Act's plain text, and it also contradicts common sense. This Court should make clear that the Act regulates these products as what they are, firearms and frames and receivers of firearms.

{"prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a legal expert trained to simulate Supreme Court oral arguments.\n\nFACTS_OF_THE_CASE:\nATF, created in 1972, is responsible for regulating firearms under the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA). The GCA requires federal firearms licensees (FFLs) to conduct background checks, record firearm transfers, and serialize firearms when selling or transferring them. The GCA's regulation of firearms is based on the definition of \"firearm,\" which includes the \"frame or receiver.\" However, ATF's 1978 definition of \"frame or receiver\" became outdated due to changes in modern firearm design, such as the AR-15 and Glock pistols. Furthermore, the rise of privately made firearms (PMFs) or \"ghost guns\" posed challenges to law enforcement because they were not regulated under the GCA and did not require serialization. In response, ATF issued a Final Rule in 2022, updating the definitions of \"frame,\" \"receiver,\" and \"firearm\" to better capture modern firearm designs and regulate PMFs. The Final Rule took effect on August 24, 2022.\nThe respondents in this case challenged the Final Rule's redefinition of \"frame or receiver\" and \"firearm,\" arguing that it exceeded ATF's congressionally mandated authority. The district court granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs and vacated the Final Rule in its entirety. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's determination that the two provisions exceeded ATF's statutory authority.\n\nLEGAL_QUESTION:\nDid the ATF exceed its statutory authority in promulgating its Final Rule purporting to regulate so-called \"ghost guns\"?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>respondent<|end_header_id|>\n\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  This case turns on decisions made by Congress in the Gun Control Act of 1968. First, Congress altered the common understanding of \"firearm\" to include other  weapons that may readily be converted to firearms. Second, in a departure from prior federal law, Congress decided to regulate only a  single part of a firearm, the frame or receiver, and Congress did not alter the common understanding of a \"frame or receiver.\"  ATF has now exceeded its authority by operating outside of the bounds set by Congress. One, ATF has expanded the definition of \"frame or receiver\" to include items that may readily be converted to a frame or receiver. And, two, ATF has expanded the definition of \"firearm\" to include collections of parts that are not weapons and that do not include a frame or receiver. Some concern has been raised about circumvention, but, of course, complying with a statute is not circumventing it. And as this Court said in Abramski, which has already been referenced, Congress, in the Gun Control Act,  did not seek to pursue its purposes of controlling access to firearms to the nth degree. And, notably, Congress did not regulate the secondary market for firearms, and that secondary market is a much bigger source of firearms for criminals than privately made firearms. There also has been questions raised about the agency's prior practice. There definitely has been a sea change by the agency here. The agency projected that its rule would put 42 out of 43 unlicensed manufacturers out of business. And what the agency said in the Syracuse litigation was they said:  \"An unfinished frame or receiver does not meet the statutory definition of 'firearm' simply because it can be designed to or can readily be converted into a frame or receiver.\"  That's the exact standard t hey've now adopted. Instead, what they looked at was whether critical machining operations had taken place. And, to be clear, we have no quarrel with that prior practice. We have raised as alternatives, one, something has to be  completely machined, or, two, the critical machining operation test. And the -- the latter, we submit, is more consistent with the statutory language and solves the machine gun problem because, if you say, in the machine gun provision, a frame or receiver is also regulated, and if one hole is all that separates a semi-automatic receiver from a machine gun receiver, it's hard to see how the \"readily\" standard would not also be applied there.

The GCA requires federal firearms licensees (FFLs) to conduct background checks, record firearm transfers, and serialize firearms when selling or transferring them. The GCA's regulation of firearms is based on the definition of \"firearm,\" which includes the \"frame or receiver.\" However, ATF's 1978 definition of \"frame or receiver\" became outdated due to changes in modern firearm design, such as the AR-15 and Glock pistols. Furthermore, the rise of privately made firearms (PMFs) or \"ghost guns\" posed challenges to law enforcement because they were not regulated under the GCA and did not require serialization. In response, ATF issued a Final Rule in 2022, updating the definitions of \"frame,\" \"receiver,\" and \"firearm\" to better capture modern firearm designs and regulate PMFs. The Final Rule took effect on August 24, 2022.\nThe respondents in this case challenged the Final Rule's redefinition of \"frame or receiver\" and \"firearm,\" arguing that it exceeded ATF's congressionally mandated authority.

The GCA requires federal firearms licensees (FFLs) to conduct background checks, record firearm transfers, and serialize firearms when selling or transferring them. The GCA's regulation of firearms is based on the definition of \"firearm,\" which includes the \"frame or receiver.\" However, ATF's 1978 definition of \"frame or receiver\" became outdated due to changes in modern firearm design, such as the AR-15 and Glock pistols. Furthermore, the rise of privately made firearms (PMFs) or \"ghost guns\" posed challenges to law enforcement because they were not regulated under the GCA and did not require serialization. In response, ATF issued a Final Rule in 2022, updating the definitions of \"frame,\" \"receiver,\" and \"firearm\" to better capture modern firearm designs and regulate PMFs. The Final Rule took effect on August 24, 2022.\nThe respondents in this case challenged the Final Rule's redefinition of \"frame or receiver\" and \"firearm,\" arguing that it exceeded ATF's congressionally mandated authority. The district court granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs and vacated the Final Rule in its entirety. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's determination that the two provisions exceeded ATF's statutory authority.\n\nLEGAL_QUESTION:\nDid the ATF exceed its statutory authority in promulgating its Final Rule purporting to regulate so-called \"ghost guns\"?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>respondent<|end_header_id|>\n\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  This case turns on decisions made by Congress in the Gun Control Act of 1968. First, Congress altered the common understanding of \"firearm\" to include other  weapons that may readily be converted to firearms. Second, in a departure from prior federal law, Congress decided to regulate only a  single part of a firearm, the frame or receiver, and Congress did not alter the common understanding of a \"frame or receiver.\"  ATF has now exceeded its authority by operating outside of the bounds set by Congress. One, ATF has expanded the definition of \"frame or receiver\" to include items that may readily be converted to a frame or receiver. And, two, ATF has expanded the definition of \"firearm\" to include collections of parts that are not weapons and that do not include a frame or receiver. Some concern has been raised about circumvention, but, of course, complying with a statute is not circumventing it. And as this Court said in Abramski, which has already been referenced, Congress, in the Gun Control Act,  did not seek to pursue its purposes of controlling access to firearms to the nth degree. And, notably, Congress did not regulate the secondary market for firearms, and that secondary market is a much bigger source of firearms for criminals than privately made firearms. There also has been questions raised about the agency's prior practice. There definitely has been a sea change by the agency here. The agency projected that its rule would put 42 out of 43 unlicensed manufacturers out of business. And what the agency said in the Syracuse litigation was they said:  \"An unfinished frame or receiver does not meet the statutory definition of 'firearm' simply because it can be designed to or can readily be converted into a frame or receiver.\"  That's the exact standard t hey've now adopted. Instead, what they looked at was whether critical machining operations had taken place. And, to be clear, we have no quarrel with that prior practice. We have raised as alternatives, one, something has to be  completely machined, or, two, the critical machining operation test. And the -- the latter, we submit, is more consistent with the statutory language and solves the machine gun problem because, if you say, in the machine gun provision, a frame or receiver is also regulated, and if one hole is all that separates a semi-automatic receiver from a machine gun receiver, it's hard to see how the \"readily\" standard would not also be applied there. I welcome the Court's questions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_sonia_sotomayor<|end_header_id|>\n\nMr. Finkelstein, if you're correct, the agency has the authority to regulate the manufacture of unfinished receivers, as it did in the Syracuse litigation, then why did it not simply do that in this rulemaking?<|eot_id|>", "question_text": "Mr. Finkelstein, if you're correct, the agency has the authority to regulate the manufacture of unfinished receivers, as it did in the Syracuse litigation, then why did it not simply do that in this rulemaking?"}]}

Horn was involved in a car accident that caused injuries to his hip and right shoulder. While seeking alternative natural remedies, he discovered an advertisement for Dixie X CBD Dew Drops Tincture, which claimed to contain 0% THC and be compliant with federal law. As a commercial truck driver subject to random drug testing, Horn carefully investigated these claims before purchasing and consuming the product in October 2012. However, he subsequently failed a drug test and lost his job, wages, and benefits. Independent lab tests confirmed that Dixie X contained THC, contrary to the advertisement's claims.\nOn August 6, 2015, Horn sued the companies who allegedly falsely marketed the product\u2014Medical Marijuana, Inc., Dixie Holdings, LLC, and Red Dice Holdings, LLC\u2014in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York, which included a civil RICO claim and eight state law claims. The district court granted partial summary judgment to the defendants, concluding that Horn lacked RICO standing because he sued for the loss of earnings, which was derivative of an antecedent personal injury. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated, concluding that nothing in the text of RICO's civil-action provision, or in its structure or history, supports a rule that bars plaintiffs from suing simply because their otherwise recoverable economic losses happen to have been connected to a non-recoverable personal injury.\n\nLEGAL_QUESTION:\nAre economic harms resulting from personal injuries properly considered injuries to \"business or property by reason of\" the defendant's acts for purposes of a civil treble-damages action under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_john_g_roberts_jr<|end_header_id|>\n\n We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 23-365, Medical Marijuana versus Horn.

Because RICO's cause of action excludes personal injuries, RICO excludes damages resulting from personal injuries.

And the references to damages he sustains shows that damages are the losses suffere d as a result of the injury. Damages are not themselves the injury inflicted by the defendant. This distinction tracks this Court's recognition that lost wages and medical expenses are classic damages from personal injuries. Respondent's complaint alleges  the personal injury of unwanted ingestion of THC and the resulting damages of lost wages. To quote the complaint:  \"Defendant's behavior caused  Plaintiff's fiscal harm in the ingestion of Dixie, and as a direct result of consuming this  product, he was dismissed from his employment.\" That's a personal injury claim outside civil RICO. Respondent argues that every economic loss is its own RICO injury but not to worry because RICO still bars non-pecuniary damages. But that view conflates injury and damages by treating RICO's exclusion of personal injuries as just excluding a narrow type of damages: pain and suffering and emotional distress. Respondent's rule also leaves the personal exclusion toothless since virtually all personal injuries result in monetary loss.

The first is about the \"damages sustained\" locution in Section 1964(c). That means  compensatory damages. We know that from the rest of the U.S. Code, the syntax of the sentence, and the plain meaning of the word \"damages.\"  So rest of  the U.S. Code, that locution, \"damages sustained,\" appears some three dozen times in the U.S. Code. It always means compensatory damages. So we point you to the example of 18 U.S.C. 2255, where victims of crime choose between liquidated damages and damages sustained. You can't choose between liquidated damages and harm. Those have to be two measures of compensation. Syntax of the rest of the sentence. The sentence says:  Recover the damages sustained. If it meant harm, you would expect it to say \"recover for the damages sustained.\" You recover for harm. You don't recover the harm. But, if it means compensatory damages, that's a perfectly sensible sentence. And, finally, the plain meaning of \"damages.\"  Every dictionary will tell you  damages is a measure of compensation, including the treatise that Petitioners cite at page 15 of their opening brief. So, absent that textual hook, the other problem with Petitioners' rule is they  still have not told you how to distinguish the human trafficking case from this case. Here are some of the things I heard my friend say:  Look at the Restatement. Well, we think the relevant Restatement principle is Section 525, the fraudulent misrepresentation tort. That's the only state law tort that survived to trial, right?  It's not a product liability claim. It's an economic tort, fraudulent misrepresentation. She said:  Look to a legal right. Well, Sedima tells us that the legal right protected by RICO is the right not to be harmed by reason of the predicate acts. She said:  Look at whether money was taken. This isn't a forfeiture or a unjust enrichment statute, right?  It's not worded that way. She said:  Look to directness. As Justice Kagan explained, that's a proximate cause problem. We recognize we have a heavy burden on remand, but that's not the argument before you. And she said:  Look at what is trying to be redressed. Here, we're trying to redress the loss of income from being fired.

Horn was involved in a car accident that caused injuries to his hip and right shoulder. While seeking alternative natural remedies, he discovered an advertisement for Dixie X CBD Dew Drops Tincture, which claimed to contain 0% THC and be compliant with federal law. As a commercial truck driver subject to random drug testing, Horn carefully investigated these claims before purchasing and consuming the product in October 2012. However, he subsequently failed a drug test and lost his job, wages, and benefits. Independent lab tests confirmed that Dixie X contained THC, contrary to the advertisement's claims.\nOn August 6, 2015, Horn sued the companies who allegedly falsely marketed the product\u2014Medical Marijuana, Inc., Dixie Holdings, LLC, and Red Dice Holdings, LLC\u2014in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York, which included a civil RICO claim and eight state law claims. The district court granted partial summary judgment to the defendants, concluding that Horn lacked RICO standing because he sued for the loss of earnings, which was derivative of an antecedent personal injury. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated, concluding that nothing in the text of RICO's civil-action provision, or in its structure or history, supports a rule that bars plaintiffs from suing simply because their otherwise recoverable economic losses happen to have been connected to a non-recoverable personal injury.\n\nLEGAL_QUESTION:\nAre economic harms resulting from personal injuries properly considered injuries to \"business or property by reason of\" the defendant's acts for purposes of a civil treble-damages action under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>respondent<|end_header_id|>\n\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  I want to address two quick points.

The first is about the \"damages sustained\" locution in Section 1964(c). That means  compensatory damages. We know that from the rest of the U.S. Code, the syntax of the sentence, and the plain meaning of the word \"damages.\"  So rest of  the U.S. Code, that locution, \"damages sustained,\" appears some three dozen times in the U.S. Code. It always means compensatory damages. So we point you to the example of 18 U.S.C. 2255, where victims of crime choose between liquidated damages and damages sustained. You can't choose between liquidated damages and harm. Those have to be two measures of compensation. Syntax of the rest of the sentence. The sentence says:  Recover the damages sustained. If it meant harm, you would expect it to say \"recover for the damages sustained.\" You recover for harm. You don't recover the harm. But, if it means compensatory damages, that's a perfectly sensible sentence. And, finally, the plain meaning of \"damages.\"  Every dictionary will tell you  damages is a measure of compensation, including the treatise that Petitioners cite at page 15 of their opening brief. So, absent that textual hook, the other problem with Petitioners' rule is they  still have not told you how to distinguish the human trafficking case from this case.

We recognize we have a heavy burden on remand, but that's not the argument before you. And she said:  Look at what is trying to be redressed. Here, we're trying to redress the loss of income from being fired. I welcome the Court's questions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_sonia_sotomayor<|end_header_id|>\n\nCan I just ask you to address this point about directness, which you said was a proximate cause issue.

During heavy rains, the system can exceed its capacity, resulting in combined sewer overflows (CSOs) that discharge pollutants into the Pacific Ocean. The Clean Water Act requires cities like San Francisco to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for such discharges. San Francisco has been implementing a CSO control plan since the late 1960s and completed construction of its current CSO control facilities in 1997.\nIn 2019, the EPA and the California Regional Water Quality Control Board issued a new NPDES permit for San Francisco's Oceanside treatment facility. San Francisco is challenging two provisions in this permit: (1) narrative prohibitions against violating water quality standards, and (2) a requirement that San Francisco update its long-term CSO control plan. San Francisco argues that these provisions are inconsistent with the Clean Water Act and EPA regulations. The EPA's Environmental Appeals Board denied San Francisco's administrative appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied San Francisco's petition for review, holding that the Clean Water Act authorizes EPA to include in the Oceanside NPDES permit the challenged provisions, and that EPA's decision to do so was rationally connected to evidence in the administrative record.\n\nLEGAL_QUESTION:\nDoes the Clean Water Act allow the Environmental Protection Agency (or an authorized state) to impose generic prohibitions in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits that subject permit-holders to enforcement for violating water quality standards without identifying specific limits to which their discharges must conform?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_john_g_roberts_jr<|end_header_id|>\n\n We'll hear argument now in Case 23-753, the City and County of San Francisco versus the Environmental Protection Agency.

The Generic Prohibitions fail this task. As Judge Collins explained below, the Generic Prohibitions erase the distinction between water quality standards and discharge limitations, making them one and the same. The Generic Prohibitions revive the very \"cause or contribute\" standard Congress repealed. And they do not function as discharge limitations. As the Second Circuit recognized, they add nothing that tells a permitholder how  to control its discharges. EPA claims it uses the Generic Prohibitions as a backstop, an insurance policy against changing circumstances. But the Clean  Water Act already gives EPA all the tools it needs to address uncertainty. EPA can reopen, modify, or terminate a permit when conditions change, and it can exercise its statutory authority to protect public welfare in emergencies. What EPA cannot do is expose permitholders to liability based on receiving water conditions it cannot control. The Generic Prohibitions are also inconsistent with the Act's permit shield. The shield protects permitholders from liability as long as they comply with their permit terms.

The EPA's Environmental Appeals Board denied San Francisco's administrative appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied San Francisco's petition for review, holding that the Clean Water Act authorizes EPA to include in the Oceanside NPDES permit the challenged provisions, and that EPA's decision to do so was rationally connected to evidence in the administrative record.\n\nLEGAL_QUESTION:\nDoes the Clean Water Act allow the Environmental Protection Agency (or an authorized state) to impose generic prohibitions in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits that subject permit-holders to enforcement for violating water quality standards without identifying specific limits to which their discharges must conform?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>respondent<|end_header_id|>\n\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  San Francisco's opening brief makes one and only one argument, that Section 1311(b)(1)(C) authorizes only effluent limitations. This Court, however, already rejected that argument in National Association of Manufacturers. And, in any event, the statutory text and history make clear that Section 1311(b)(1)(C) also authorizes other limitations. San  -- San Francisco is therefore wrong to argue that limitations like the ones challenged here are never okay. But that does not mean that they are always okay. Under the statute, EPA may rely on limitations like the ones here only when EPA lacks assurance that the permit's effluent limitations alone are insufficient to protect water quality. Even then, EPA may rely on limitations like the ones here only when EPA lacks the information necessary to develop more  tailored limitations. And, finally, EPA may not impose limitations of any kind that are unconstitutionally vague. San Francisco pressed each of those limiting principles below. But the court of appeals rejected each of San Francisco's case-specific challenges. The court held at Petition Appendix 40 that the permit's effluent limitations alone would be insufficient to protect water quality. The court held at Petition Appendix 46 to 47 that San Francisco had failed to update its long-term control plan, thus depriving EPA of the information necessary to develop more tailored limitations. And the court at Petition Appendix 32 rejected San Francisco's vagueness challenge. San Francisco did not seek this Court's review of any of those parts of the decision below. Rather than pursue an individualized challenge to the limitations in this case, San Francisco has put before this Court only a facial challenge:  That all limitations that prohibit discharges based on their effects on water quality are invalid on their face because they don't fit the statutory definition of effluent limitation.

San Francisco argues that these provisions are inconsistent with the Clean Water Act and EPA regulations. The EPA's Environmental Appeals Board denied San Francisco's administrative appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied San Francisco's petition for review, holding that the Clean Water Act authorizes EPA to include in the Oceanside NPDES permit the challenged provisions, and that EPA's decision to do so was rationally connected to evidence in the administrative record.\n\nLEGAL_QUESTION:\nDoes the Clean Water Act allow the Environmental Protection Agency (or an authorized state) to impose generic prohibitions in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits that subject permit-holders to enforcement for violating water quality standards without identifying specific limits to which their discharges must conform?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>respondent<|end_header_id|>\n\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  San Francisco's opening brief makes one and only one argument, that Section 1311(b)(1)(C) authorizes only effluent limitations. This Court, however, already rejected that argument in National Association of Manufacturers. And, in any event, the statutory text and history make clear that Section 1311(b)(1)(C) also authorizes other limitations. San  -- San Francisco is therefore wrong to argue that limitations like the ones challenged here are never okay. But that does not mean that they are always okay. Under the statute, EPA may rely on limitations like the ones here only when EPA lacks assurance that the permit's effluent limitations alone are insufficient to protect water quality. Even then, EPA may rely on limitations like the ones here only when EPA lacks the information necessary to develop more  tailored limitations. And, finally, EPA may not impose limitations of any kind that are unconstitutionally vague. San Francisco pressed each of those limiting principles below. But the court of appeals rejected each of San Francisco's case-specific challenges. The court held at Petition Appendix 40 that the permit's effluent limitations alone would be insufficient to protect water quality. The court held at Petition Appendix 46 to 47 that San Francisco had failed to update its long-term control plan, thus depriving EPA of the information necessary to develop more tailored limitations. And the court at Petition Appendix 32 rejected San Francisco's vagueness challenge. San Francisco did not seek this Court's review of any of those parts of the decision below. Rather than pursue an individualized challenge to the limitations in this case, San Francisco has put before this Court only a facial challenge:  That all limitations that prohibit discharges based on their effects on water quality are invalid on their face because they don't fit the statutory definition of effluent limitation. Because that argument can't be squared with this Court's precedents or the statute itself, this Court should affirm.

Those textual clues point to standard principles of judicial review of agency action. That is, the Veterans Cour t reviews legal aspects of the Secretary's application of 5107(b) de novo and factual aspects deferentially, here, for clear error.

But, when Congress enacted (b)(1) in 2002, it took what was implicit or just generally covered in (a) and made it explicit and specific. It put an exclamation point on it. That's not nothing. Think of the Tenth Amendment, for example. But, even if you think that our interpretation renders (b)(1) largely redundant, it's still better than the alternative that Petitioners offer you. Petitioners say that the approximate balance finding should be reviewed de novo. But  that creates needless contradictions in the text. It conflicts with the express standard of review Congress supplied in (a)(4). It's in  serious tension with the prohibition on trial de novo in subsection (c). It's a real divergence from standard principles of judicial review generally and judicial review of agency decisions more specifically. And it's even inconsistent with the way other factual issues under (b)(1) are reviewed, as my friend mentioned this morning, like the in-service connection or existence of a disability. If Congress intended that highly irregular result, I think the language in (b)(1) is an awfully cryptic way of going about it. So, as between two interpretations, one that's sort of consistent, coherent, with a little bit of redundancy, and one that eliminates the redundancy at the cost of a statute at war with itself, I think you should pick the former over the latter.

Think of the Tenth Amendment, for example. But, even if you think that our interpretation renders (b)(1) largely redundant, it's still better than the alternative that Petitioners offer you. Petitioners say that the approximate balance finding should be reviewed de novo. But  that creates needless contradictions in the text. It conflicts with the express standard of review Congress supplied in (a)(4). It's in  serious tension with the prohibition on trial de novo in subsection (c). It's a real divergence from standard principles of judicial review generally and judicial review of agency decisions more specifically.

The Secretary and Director moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the revocation decision was unreviewable because it was a discretionary action.

In other words, the petition cannot remain approved if the agency reconsiders its initial decision and concludes that there was a sham marriage. That's because an approved visa petition confers no substantive benefits. It is simply a piece of paper signifying that a beneficiary is eligible to apply for a green card. If Congress believed you shouldn't get that piece of paper saying that you're eligible when you've been in a sham marriage, then -- then the agency has to take it away when it determines that you're not, in fact, eligible.

Nor does it explain what purpose such discretion could serve if, as the government appears to believe, it's not actually allowed to give the beneficiary a green card. The discretion appears to simply be the discretion to allow a person to hold on to a now meaningless piece of paper that has been drained of all of its value. That cannot be the kind  of discretion that Congress sought to protect. The government's view also layers one anomaly on top of another. Most significantly, it creates a disparity in review between an initial decision and a reconsideration of that same decision based on the same criteria.

Despite Bouarfa's response, the Secretary revoked the approval, and Bouarfa's appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals was unsuccessful.\nBouarfa sued in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, challenging the officials' actions as arbitrary and capricious. The Secretary and Director moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the revocation decision was unreviewable because it was a discretionary action. The district court granted the motion, concluding that while the action was based on nondiscretionary criteria, the action itself was discretionary and thus that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to review the decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\n\nLEGAL_QUESTION:\nMay a visa petitioner obtain judicial review when an approved petition is revoked on the basis of nondiscretionary criteria?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>respondent<|end_header_id|>\n\n Mr. Chief Justice, and  may it please the Court:  There were more than 900,000 I-130 visa petitions filed last year, and USCIS granted, denied, or revoked more than 800,000 such petitions. Given this volume, Congress had every reason to streamline judicial review by prohibiting litigation at the revocation  stage. And, to be clear, the government believes that Congress did prohibit litigation by making revocations discretionary, including in the face of a sham-marriage determination. The government does not view a revocation as mandatory in that stage, and I am not aware of a longstanding position of the kind that counsel suggests. The text is very clear on this. Section 1252 bars review of actions, the authority for which is specified to be in the  discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security. And Section 1155 specifies that the  Secretary's authority to revoke visa petitions is discretionary at least three times over, as Justice Alito was noting. It uses the term \"may,\" which connotes discretion. It uses the term \"deems,\" which  fairly exudes discretion. And it uses the capacious term \"good and sufficient cause,\" which calls for a discretionary judgment. Now I -- I don't hear Petitioner today to be advancing the secondary argument that I think we saw in his briefing with respect to the idea that a sham -- at least an underlying sham-marriage determination might be reviewable even if the revocation decision itself is  not because the revocation decision is clearly discretionary under Section 1155, and I think that's for good reason. I don't think that this Court has ever suggested that someone can evade a judicial review bar on review of a decision by breaking that decision into its constituent parts. And, here, the text of Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is very clear because it says that you  --it puts the focus on the nature of the agency's authority. So it says:  A decision, the authority for which is specified  to be in the Secretary's discretion.

The defendants removed the case to federal court, which remanded it back to state court, and then they appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which determined that the antitrust and unjust-enrichment claims raised substantial federal issues and belonged in federal court. Upon returning to the district court, Wullschleger amended her complaint to remove references to federal law, dropped the antitrust and unjust-enrichment claims, and added a civil-conspiracy claim. Despite these changes, the district court exercised federal-question jurisdiction and ultimately granted the manufacturers' motion to dismiss, leading to a second appeal. Reviewing the case de novo, the Eighth Circuit concluded that amending a complaint to eliminate the only federal questions destroys subject-matter jurisdiction and thus returned the case to state court.\n\nLEGAL_QUESTION:\nCan a plaintiff whose state-court lawsuit has been removed by the defendants to federal court seek to have the case sent back to state court by amending the complaint to omit all references to federal law?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_john_g_roberts_jr<|end_header_id|>\n\n We'll hear argument next in Case 23-677, Royal Canin versus Wullschleger.

It conflicts with the text and structure of Section 1367 and with more than a century of precedent. Chief Justice Marshall held in Mollan against Torrance in 1824 that in a diversity case, a federal court's jurisdiction once vested cannot be divested by subsequent events. The Court extended that reasoning to removal actions in Kirby against American Soda in 1904. And in 1938, this Court held in St. Paul  Mercury that if the plaintiff after removal amends his pleadings, this does not deprive the district court of jurisdiction because the defendant's statutory right to removal should not be subject to the plaintiff's caprice. The second Justice Marshall confirmed that conclusion in Carnegie -Mellon against Cohill in 1988, and Justice Scalia concurred in Rockwell in 2007. Respondents ask this Court to upset that settled interpretation, claiming that it conflicts with the text of Section 1367. But  Congress codified this Court's longstanding precedent in the text of Section 1367 itself, making clear that if the federal court has original jurisdiction, it shall continue to have supplemental jurisdiction unless Congress expressly provided otherwise. Respondents cannot cite a single decision of this Court, a single decision of a court of appeals outside of the Eighth Circuit, or a single treatise that supports their position. Respondents realize how weak their case is and instead ask the Court to decide something else, whether Grable should be overruled and, if not, whether Grable's requirements were met.

The defendants removed the case to federal court, which remanded it back to state court, and then they appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which determined that the antitrust and unjust-enrichment claims raised substantial federal issues and belonged in federal court. Upon returning to the district court, Wullschleger amended her complaint to remove references to federal law, dropped the antitrust and unjust-enrichment claims, and added a civil-conspiracy claim. Despite these changes, the district court exercised federal-question jurisdiction and ultimately granted the manufacturers' motion to dismiss, leading to a second appeal. Reviewing the case de novo, the Eighth Circuit concluded that amending a complaint to eliminate the only federal questions destroys subject-matter jurisdiction and thus returned the case to state court.\n\nLEGAL_QUESTION:\nCan a plaintiff whose state-court lawsuit has been removed by the defendants to federal court seek to have the case sent back to state court by amending the complaint to omit all references to federal law?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>respondent<|end_header_id|>\n\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The life of the law has not been logic.

And while I take a back seat to nobody in my love of our four-legged friends, I am confident Congress believed that misbranded human product was a more substantial federal issue than misbranded pet food. If we turn to which complaint controls, the Eighth Circuit again should be affirmed. My friend and I crucially agree the text of 1367 is dispositive here. And, remarkably, we also agree, if this case were originally in federal court, it must be dismissed. Why?  Because, by amending out all of the federal issues, they're no longer in the action.

The adjustment is based on two formulas: the Medicare fraction and the Medicaid fraction. The Medicare fraction, which is at the center of this dispute, represents the percentage of a hospital's Medicare patients who are also entitled to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits.\nOver 200 hospitals are challenging the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) interpretation of who counts as \"entitled to supplementary security income benefits\" for the Medicare fraction calculation. HHS considers only patients who qualify for the monthly SSI cash payment during their hospital stay, while the hospitals argue that all patients enrolled in the SSI program should be included, even if they don't receive a payment that month. The hospitals also dispute HHS's matching process and seek access to detailed SSI payment codes for their patients. After being denied relief by HHS's internal review board and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the hospitals sought judicial review, but the district court granted summary judgment to HHS. The U.S. Circuit Court for the D.C.

Just two terms ago, in Empire Health, this Court looked at the words \"entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A\" and said that it means qualifying for the Medicare Part A program. \"Entitled to SSI benefits\" in the same sentence should mean the same thing, qualifying for the SSI program. A person qualifies for the SSI program when she applies and is determined eligible, and that eligibility lasts until it is terminated. The government disagrees because it says that there's no such thing as an SSI program and the only SSI benefit is a monthly cash payment. But Congress created what it called a national program, and it created a program of income insurance. This is a program where a  person who's low income enough to qualify in the first place is promised a minimum guaranteed  income for a calendar year, and in the months where that income is not needed, the cash payment is suspended. Nothing is terminated, and other benefits remain available. In the end, this is about DSH, and DSH is about ensuring that hospitals are reimbursed for low-income patients that are less healthy and that are costlier to treat, and health does not change overnight. The government's interpretation simply does not count that low-income population. It does not count the low -income Medicaid patient coming out of a nursing home.

A person qualifies for the SSI program when she applies and is determined eligible, and that eligibility lasts until it is terminated.

And in the Medicare fraction, Congress used a patient's entitlement to SSI benefits as a proxy for determining whether the patient is low income. SSI benefits are monthly cash payments made by SSA when a person meets eligibility requirements in a particular month, including the requirement of having low income in that month. Thus, as HHS has consistently recognized since Congress enacted the Medicare fraction, a person is entitled to SSI benefits only when he satisfies the requirements for a cash payment during the month of his hospital stay. That interpretation is fully consistent with the one this Court upheld in Empire Health. The Medica re fraction uses two distinct phrases, \"entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A\" and \"entitled to SSI benefits under Title XVI.\"  And while the word \"entitled\" means the same thing within both phrases, benefits under Medicare Part A are fundamentally distinct from SSI benefits under Title XVI. Petitioners claim that a person is entitled to SSI benefits even if he is not owed a cash payment during the month of his hospital  stay so long as he received at least a single cash payment sometime within the year prior to his hospital stay. But SSI benefits are monthly cash paymen ts. So, if a person is not entitled to the cash payment in a particular month, he's simply not entitled to SSI benefits in that month. Petitioners also claim that SSI benefits under Title XVI include not only cash payments but also certain non-cash benefits. But those non-cash benefits are not supplemental security income benefits because they are not cash payments made by SSA, nor are they provided under Title XVI.

The hospitals also dispute HHS's matching process and seek access to detailed SSI payment codes for their patients. After being denied relief by HHS's internal review board and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the hospitals sought judicial review, but the district court granted summary judgment to HHS. The U.S. Circuit Court for the D.C. Circuit affirmed.\n\nLEGAL_QUESTION:\nDoes the phrase \"entitled\u2026 to benefits\" include all who meet basic program eligibility criteria, whether or not benefits are actually received?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>respondent<|end_header_id|>\n\n Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The DSH provision is designed to compensate hospitals for serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients. And in the Medicare fraction, Congress used a patient's entitlement to SSI benefits as a proxy for determining whether the patient is low income. SSI benefits are monthly cash payments made by SSA when a person meets eligibility requirements in a particular month, including the requirement of having low income in that month. Thus, as HHS has consistently recognized since Congress enacted the Medicare fraction, a person is entitled to SSI benefits only when he satisfies the requirements for a cash payment during the month of his hospital stay. That interpretation is fully consistent with the one this Court upheld in Empire Health. The Medica re fraction uses two distinct phrases, \"entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A\" and \"entitled to SSI benefits under Title XVI.\"  And while the word \"entitled\" means the same thing within both phrases, benefits under Medicare Part A are fundamentally distinct from SSI benefits under Title XVI. Petitioners claim that a person is entitled to SSI benefits even if he is not owed a cash payment during the month of his hospital  stay so long as he received at least a single cash payment sometime within the year prior to his hospital stay. But SSI benefits are monthly cash paymen ts. So, if a person is not entitled to the cash payment in a particular month, he's simply not entitled to SSI benefits in that month. Petitioners also claim that SSI benefits under Title XVI include not only cash payments but also certain non-cash benefits. But those non-cash benefits are not supplemental security income benefits because they are not cash payments made by SSA, nor are they provided under Title XVI. Ultimately, Petitioners would routinely count patients as low income even though they are earning too much income to be entitled to an SSI benefit. That approach is flatly inconsistent with Congress's choice of SSI entitlement as the proxy for low-income status.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed and remanded, finding that Heath identified enough specific evidence of discriminatory pricing to allow a reasonable jury to find that Wisconsin Bell, acting with the required scienter, charged specific schools and libraries more than it charged similarly situated customers.\n\nLEGAL_QUESTION:\nDo reimbursement requests submitted to the Federal Communications Commission's E-rate program qualify as \"claims\" under the False Claims Act?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_john_g_roberts_jr<|end_header_id|>\n\n We will hear argument this morning in Case 23-1127, Wisconsin Bell versus United States ex rel. Todd Heath. Ms. Ho.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>petitioner<|end_header_id|>\n\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  The False Claims Act, which casts its shadow over every aspect of the administrative state, has always been trained on guarding the public fisc. The FCA protects government funds by defining a claim as a request for money the government provides or that's presented to a government agent. As a result of political branch choices, E-rate reimbursement requests check neither box. The program could have been funded with public money and administered by a government agency, but the political branches chose private funding and a private administrator to prevent E-rate money from being used to mask budget shortfalls and to avoid the Government Corporation Control Act. The consequence of those choices is that E-rate reimbursement requests aren't FCA claims. First, the government doesn't provide any money in the E-rate program. Text, context, structure, and history all confirm that the government provides money for FCA purposes only if it supplies money from its own funds, putting  the public fisc at risk. That never happened here. The government doesn't provide money by making one private party pay another private party, and the government doesn't provide money by collecting debts owed to a private party and in which the government has no financial stake. Second, the program's private administrator, the Administrative Company, isn't a government agent. By design, it lacks power to bind the government, which in turn lacks control over what matters here:  grants of E-rate reimbursement requests. In fact, we know the company can't be a government agent because, if it were, it would violate the Government Corporation Control Act. Choices have consequences, and the choices made by the political branches to insulate the E-rate program from the public fisc foreclose applying the FCA. I welcome the Court's questions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_sonia_sotomayor<|end_header_id|>\n\n Ms. Ho, I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question.<|eot_id|>", "question_text": "Ms. Ho, I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question."}]}

The program provides federal subsidies on a sliding scale, and service providers must follow the \"lowest-corresponding-price\" rule, offering schools and libraries the lowest price charged to similarly situated non-residential customers. Wisconsin Bell, aware of this rule since its inception, provided services to hundreds of eligible schools and libraries under the E-rate program.\nDespite knowing about the rule, Wisconsin Bell did not train its sales representatives or implement compliance mechanisms until 2009. The company admitted to treating pricing contracts for schools and libraries the same as other customers, often instructing sales representatives to offer the highest prices possible. In 2009, following a settlement by its parent company with the Department of Justice and FCC, Wisconsin Bell developed a compliance plan. In 2008, Todd Heath filed a qui tam action under the False Claims Act, alleging that Wisconsin Bell submitted false claims and certifications related to the E-rate program.

The administrator pays on the government's behalf using money the government collects and controls  to advance a federal program that the government created. FCC mandates, which the administrator must follow, specify who must be paid and how much they must be paid. So, when the administrator paid Wisconsin Bell, that was the government providing money through its agent. Indeed, many government programs, including most notably Medicare, use private claims administrators to provide billions of dollars to beneficiaries of government programs. As Justice Kagan's soup hypothetical, Justice Barrett's proctor hypothetical illustrate, when an entity like the government provides money through agents, we credit the principal in that situation. So, when Wisconsin Bell  receives money, claims money, from the E-rate program, we credit the government with providing it. FCC mandates also  determine carriers' obligations to contribute to the Universal Service Fund. Those mandates are how the government provided funds to this program, and  it doesn't matter that the government routed the funds directly from the carriers to the  Universal Service Fund instead of requiring an unnecessary detour through federal Treasury accounts because the False Claims Act's applicability doesn't turn on bookkeeping conventions, which is also a point Ms. Ho made, I think, quite well. The point is not exactly how did the money move through a bureaucracy, was it routed efficiently or less efficiently. The point is who is really making the money move, and it is the government. The government is the only relevant decision-maker at all stages of creating, funding, and then controlling the distributions from this program. The administrator merely does what the government wants. Under the plain meaning of the word \"provide,\" the government therefore provides the money Wisconsin Bell claims.

{"prompt": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a legal expert trained to simulate Supreme Court oral arguments.\n\nFACTS_OF_THE_CASE:\nUnder the so-called \"American Rule,\" each litigant pays their own attorney's fees, regardless of whether they win or lose. However, certain statutes permit the payment of \"a reasonable attorney's fee\" to \"the prevailing party\" in litigation; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 is one such statute, permitting the payment of attorney's fees to parties that prevail in civil rights litigation.\nSeveral indigent Virginia residents challenged in federal court a state statute that required automatic suspension of the driver's licenses of those who failed to pay certain court fines and fees. Finding the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their case, the district court granted a preliminary injunction ordering the state to remove the plaintiffs' suspensions. The state did not appeal the injunction, so the plaintiffs were able to drive again. Before the case could go to trial, the Virginia legislature repealed the statute. The plaintiffs then petitioned for attorney's fees under Section 1988, but the district court rejected that request, citing a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit holding that a grant of a preliminary injunction does not render a plaintiff a \"prevailing party.\" The plaintiffs appealed. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, but, on rehearing, the en banc 4th Circuit reversed.\n\nLEGAL_QUESTION:\nIs a party who obtains a preliminary injunction a \"prevailing party\" for purposes of being entitled to attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1988?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_john_g_roberts_jr<|end_header_id|>\n\n We'll hear argument next in Case 23-621, Lackey versus Stinnie.

A preliminary injunction is neither a final judgment nor a determination that the defendant is liable on the merits for violating federal law. It is simply a threshold prediction of the likelihood of success based on a truncated record and an initial, often hasty assessment of the law that may well prove to be faulty as the case proceeds. It provid es no enduring relief. By its nature, it is a temporary procedural order that dissolves upon final judgment. A preliminary injunction, therefore, does not make a plaintiff a prevailing party  within the meaning of that legal term of art, and, thus, no statutory exception to the de fault American rule applies. Legal dictionaries at the time Congress enacted Section 1988 defined  \"prevailing party\" based on whether the party had successfully maintained its claim, looking to the end of the suit, not on its degree of success at earlier stages. This Court's precedent similarly provides that liability for fees and liability on the merits go hand in hand. The Court should therefore adopt a bright-line rule serving the critical interest in ready administrability that a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff the prevailing party.

Now, while a plaintiff whose case is dismissed might not lose on the merits, Section 1988 does not award fees to non-losing parties. It requires prevailing party status.

The plaintiffs, each having filed applications for benefits, alleged various grievances against the Department's processing methods. Subsequently, Secretary Washington and the Department filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In response, the plaintiffs amended their complaint, which resulted in the omission of several initial claims and the exclusion of the Department as a defendant.\nThe remaining allegations in the suit were federal claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, accusing Secretary Washington of implementing policies and procedures that violated both the Social Security Act of 1935, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 503(a)(1), and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs sought various forms of relief, including multiple permanent and preliminary injunctions to expedite the handling of unemployment compensation applications and improve communication clarity, as well as attorney fees. Secretary Washington again moved to dismiss the case, citing reasons such as lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, absence of a private cause of action, and the substantive meritlessness of the claims. The court granted the dismissal without stating the basis for it. The plaintiffs moved to alter, amend, or vacate the judgment, but the court denied their motion. They then appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court, which affirmed the dismissal, concluding that the lower court lacked jurisdiction over the suit because the plaintiffs had not yet exhausted mandatory administrative remedies.\n\nLEGAL_QUESTION:\nDoes a Section 1983 claim brought in state court require the plaintiffs to first exhaust state administrative remedies?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_john_g_roberts_jr<|end_header_id|>\n\n We will hear argument first this term in Case 23-191, Williams versus Fitzgerald.

In Patsy, this Court held that a failure  to exhaust was not a defense to liability under Section 1983. In this case, however, the Supreme Court of Alabama dismissed Petitioners' claims because Petitioners failed to exhaust, contradicting Patsy's holding. Felder confirms that Patsy applies in state court. This Court reasoned that the dominant characteristic of a civil rights claim is that it's judicially enforceable in the first instance, and that characteristic does not vary depending on whether the suit is filed in federal or state court. The same reasoning applies to this case. Respondent characterizes Alabama's statute as a neutral procedural rule. But there's nothing neutral about it. A claimant  has to seek relief from the Secretary before suing the Secretary. The claimant never  -- the Secretary never has to seek relief from the claimant for anything and never has any reason to exhaust any remedy. Respondent also emphasizes that Alabama's law is jurisdictional. But this Court has held that a state cannot avoid preemption by defining the jurisdiction of state courts to exclude cases in which the defendant asserts an affirmative defense that this Court has held is not available.

Nothing in 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 makes clear that it was meant to preempt neutral jurisdictional rules like the one at issue here. Petitioners' reliance on Patsy ignores the key difference between exhaustion rules created by Congress and exhaustion doctrines crafted by courts. The former may preempt, but the latter do not. They are judge-made timing rules, like ripeness and abstention, that do not add elements to a federal right but merely determine when a federal court is going to hear it. This Court's ripeness and abstention holdings do not apply to state courts. Nor does  its determination that federal courts generally should not send 1983 plaintiffs to the states. Precedent confirms that 1983 does not contain a categorical no -exhaustion element. In Johnson v. Fankell, the Court did not require immediate appellate review of a 1983 defense.

Thus, while some notice of claims rules, like the one in Felder, are preempted as obstacles to adjudication and liability, agency review is typically a means of adjudication and does not inherently conflict with 1983's remedial purpose.

Petitioners' reliance on Patsy ignores the key difference between exhaustion rules created by Congress and exhaustion doctrines crafted by courts. The former may preempt, but the latter do not.

These decisions show that deferring consideration of a federal right does not necessarily alter or defeat it.

The data originated from a personality quiz integrated on Facebook by Aleksandr Kogan, who gained access to users' data and their Facebook friends' data without consent. Although only about 270,000 users took the quiz, Kogan harvested data from over 30 million users. Cambridge Analytica used this data to create personality profiles of American voters, which were allegedly used to benefit political campaigns, including Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\nFacebook learned of Cambridge Analytica's misconduct in 2015 but failed to inform affected users. The company continued to investigate the data usage and negotiated a confidential settlement with Kogan in 2016. Despite assurances that the data had been deleted, Facebook discovered in 2016 that Cambridge Analytica was still using the data. The scandal became public in March 2018, leading to significant drops in Facebook's stock price. Shortly after, it was revealed that Facebook had been sharing user data with dozens of whitelisted third parties without express user consent, contradicting previous statements about data control and privacy. These revelations, along with subsequent privacy concerns and regulatory actions, led to further stock price declines and reduced revenue growth for Facebook. Shareholders filed a securities fraud action against Facebook and its executives, alleging violations of Sections 10(b), 20(a), and 20A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act's implementing regulations.\nThe district court dismissed the shareholders' claims, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that under the heightened standard of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, the shareholders adequately pleaded falsity as to some of the challenged risk statements.\n\nLEGAL_QUESTION:\nAre risk disclosures false or misleading when they do not disclose that a risk has materialized in the past, even if that past event presents no known risk of ongoing or future business harm?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_john_g_roberts_jr<|end_header_id|>\n\n We will hear argument this morning in Case 23-980, Facebook versus Amalgamated Bank.

The Ninth Circuit held that a risk disclosure can be misleading  simply because a company does not disclose that the specified triggering event for the risk had occurred in the past. That holding was incorrect. A risk disclosure warrants that a type of event may cause harm in the future. It usually makes no representation that the event had never previously occurred. The Ninth Circuit's approach would trigger serious concerns about over-disclosure and fraud by hindsight, and this Court should reject it. Instead, the Court should adopt a similar approach to the one it took for statements of opinion in Omnicare. There, the Court held that statements of opinion were  ordinarily not actionable as false statements, but the Court recognized that a statement of opinion could be misleading based on an embedded representation about how the speaker formed the opinion. So too here, depending on the content of the statement, a forward-looking risk disclosure can be misleading based on an embedded premise about the current state of affairs. But just as a statement that the road may be flooded if it rains cannot be misleading simply because it rained yesterday, a typical risk disclosure cannot be misleading simply because the triggering event had occurred in the past. Under the correct approach, this case is an easy one. Meta's warnings that business harm could result in the event of data misuse did not imply that Meta had never previously suffered such misuse. But, in any event, the  initial misuse of the data had been publicly reported by the time Meta made the statements at  issue, and Respondents have abandoned any claim based on the continued misuse of the data. And  far from being virtually certain to cause a risk of harm to Meta's business, the initial misuse of the data did not result in any harm when it was publicly reported.

The Ninth Circuit's approach would trigger serious concerns about over-disclosure and fraud by hindsight, and this Court should reject it. Instead, the Court should adopt a similar approach to the one it took for statements of opinion in Omnicare. There, the Court held that statements of opinion were  ordinarily not actionable as false statements, but the Court recognized that a statement of opinion could be misleading based on an embedded representation about how the speaker formed the opinion. So too here, depending on the content of the statement, a forward-looking risk disclosure can be misleading based on an embedded premise about the current state of affairs. But just as a statement that the road may be flooded if it rains cannot be misleading simply because it rained yesterday, a typical risk disclosure cannot be misleading simply because the triggering event had occurred in the past. Under the correct approach, this case is an easy one. Meta's warnings that business harm could result in the event of data misuse did not imply that Meta had never previously suffered such misuse. But, in any event, the  initial misuse of the data had been publicly reported by the time Meta made the statements at  issue, and Respondents have abandoned any claim based on the continued misuse of the data. And  far from being virtually certain to cause a risk of harm to Meta's business, the initial misuse of the data did not result in any harm when it was publicly reported.

First, as to the actual question presented, we agree that a risk disclosure is not misleading because it omits disclosure of an event that is immaterial because it risks no  business harm. The Ninth Circuit did not hold otherwise. Second, we agree that in addition to proving materiality, plaintiffs must also show  that the risk statement implies that the omitted event did not occur. We don't claim that every risk statement includes that implication. Our position is simply that they can and frequently do, and that ultimately depends on the facts and context of each case. Third, for that reason, the Court should reject Facebook's categorical rule that Item 105 statements are always agnostic about whether the risk has transpired in the past. Facebook admits that if a student tells his parents that there's a risk he may fail an exam when he's already done so, that is misleading because it implies it's impossible that he won't when that isn't true. The same is true of many risk factor statements, including the ones at issue in this case stating that the  -- describing an improper disclosure of user data as a hypothetical risk implied that it was possible it wouldn't occur. And that wasn't  possible because it already had. This does not mean that issuers must disclose every material occurrence of a risk. They simply must say enough to remove the false impression that the omitted event has not yet materialized, something they generally can do, as Facebook did here with respect to hacking, by simply acknowledging that the risk has materialized in the past. Finally, the Ninth Circuit did not adopt any contrary categorical rule. The Court did not discuss whether these particular statements were agnostic about the past because Facebook never argued that they were. It elected instead to argue only that the warned-of risks had not transpired because it viewed the warned -of risks as speaking only to hacking events and business harm. Because Facebook does not challenge the Ninth Circuit's fact-bound rejection of those claims in this Court, this Court should provide any necessary guidance for future cases in the course of affirming the judgment.

First, as to the actual question presented, we agree that a risk disclosure is not misleading because it omits disclosure of an event that is immaterial because it risks no  business harm. The Ninth Circuit did not hold otherwise. Second, we agree that in addition to proving materiality, plaintiffs must also show  that the risk statement implies that the omitted event did not occur. We don't claim that every risk statement includes that implication. Our position is simply that they can and frequently do, and that ultimately depends on the facts and context of each case. Third, for that reason, the Court should reject Facebook's categorical rule that Item 105 statements are always agnostic about whether the risk has transpired in the past. Facebook admits that if a student tells his parents that there's a risk he may fail an exam when he's already done so, that is misleading because it implies it's impossible that he won't when that isn't true. The same is true of many risk factor statements, including the ones at issue in this case stating that the  -- describing an improper disclosure of user data as a hypothetical risk implied that it was possible it wouldn't occur. And that wasn't  possible because it already had. This does not mean that issuers must disclose every material occurrence of a risk. They simply must say enough to remove the false impression that the omitted event has not yet materialized, something they generally can do, as Facebook did here with respect to hacking, by simply acknowledging that the risk has materialized in the past. Finally, the Ninth Circuit did not adopt any contrary categorical rule. The Court did not discuss whether these particular statements were agnostic about the past because Facebook never argued that they were. It elected instead to argue only that the warned-of risks had not transpired because it viewed the warned -of risks as speaking only to hacking events and business harm. Because Facebook does not challenge the Ninth Circuit's fact-bound rejection of those claims in this Court, this Court should provide any necessary guidance for future cases in the course of affirming the judgment.

The data originated from a personality quiz integrated on Facebook by Aleksandr Kogan, who gained access to users' data and their Facebook friends' data without consent. Although only about 270,000 users took the quiz, Kogan harvested data from over 30 million users. Cambridge Analytica used this data to create personality profiles of American voters, which were allegedly used to benefit political campaigns, including Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\nFacebook learned of Cambridge Analytica's misconduct in 2015 but failed to inform affected users. The company continued to investigate the data usage and negotiated a confidential settlement with Kogan in 2016. Despite assurances that the data had been deleted, Facebook discovered in 2016 that Cambridge Analytica was still using the data.

The data originated from a personality quiz integrated on Facebook by Aleksandr Kogan, who gained access to users' data and their Facebook friends' data without consent. Although only about 270,000 users took the quiz, Kogan harvested data from over 30 million users. Cambridge Analytica used this data to create personality profiles of American voters, which were allegedly used to benefit political campaigns, including Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\nFacebook learned of Cambridge Analytica's misconduct in 2015 but failed to inform affected users. The company continued to investigate the data usage and negotiated a confidential settlement with Kogan in 2016. Despite assurances that the data had been deleted, Facebook discovered in 2016 that Cambridge Analytica was still using the data. The scandal became public in March 2018, leading to significant drops in Facebook's stock price. Shortly after, it was revealed that Facebook had been sharing user data with dozens of whitelisted third parties without express user consent, contradicting previous statements about data control and privacy. These revelations, along with subsequent privacy concerns and regulatory actions, led to further stock price declines and reduced revenue growth for Facebook. Shareholders filed a securities fraud action against Facebook and its executives, alleging violations of Sections 10(b), 20(a), and 20A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act's implementing regulations.\nThe district court dismissed the shareholders' claims, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that under the heightened standard of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, the shareholders adequately pleaded falsity as to some of the challenged risk statements.\n\nLEGAL_QUESTION:\nAre risk disclosures false or misleading when they do not disclose that a risk has materialized in the past, even if that past event presents no known risk of ongoing or future business harm?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>respondent<|end_header_id|>\n\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start by making clear our position. First, as to the actual question presented, we agree that a risk disclosure is not misleading because it omits disclosure of an event that is immaterial because it risks no  business harm. The Ninth Circuit did not hold otherwise. Second, we agree that in addition to proving materiality, plaintiffs must also show  that the risk statement implies that the omitted event did not occur. We don't claim that every risk statement includes that implication. Our position is simply that they can and frequently do, and that ultimately depends on the facts and context of each case. Third, for that reason, the Court should reject Facebook's categorical rule that Item 105 statements are always agnostic about whether the risk has transpired in the past. Facebook admits that if a student tells his parents that there's a risk he may fail an exam when he's already done so, that is misleading because it implies it's impossible that he won't when that isn't true. The same is true of many risk factor statements, including the ones at issue in this case stating that the  -- describing an improper disclosure of user data as a hypothetical risk implied that it was possible it wouldn't occur.

Mr. Waxman.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>petitioner<|end_header_id|>\n\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  Richard Glossip was convicted on the word of one man, Justin Sneed, the undisputed murderer in this case. Oklahoma has now disclosed evidence revealing that Mr. Sneed lied to the jury about his history of psychiatric treatment, including the fact that a prison psychiatrist prescribed lithium to treat his previously undiagnosed bipolar disorder. The prosecution suppressed that evidence and then failed to correct Mr. Sneed's perjured denial, just as it suppressed evidence that in the middle of trial, in violation of the court's sequestration order, Sneed altered his testimony about the knife wounds on the victim at the urgent request of the prosecutor, who then falsely denied to the court her prior knowledge. There is no adequate or independent jurisdictional bar to review and no warrant for an evidentiary hearing. As to independence, the court's opinion is suffused with merits determinations on the Brady and Napue claims. And, certainly, there is no \"clear and express statement\" that the court's decision is based on a bona fide separate, adequate, and independent grounds, as long required by this Court to preclude review. Nor is there any adequate bar. By rejecting the State's waiver, the court created a jurisdictional threshold it had never applied in any other case. The disposition was \"without support in prior state law,\" as required by over 60 years of this Court's precedent to establish adequacy. No evidentiary hearing could alter the conclusion that Mr. Glossip was denied due process. There's no dispute that, contrary to Sneed's sworn testimony, the State's own suppressed record shows that he was, in fact, treated by a psychiatrist for bipolar disorder, just as there is no dispute that Sneed changed his testimony about the knife at the  urgent mid-trial request of the prosecutor, who then falsely denied that very fact to the court.

The prosecution suppressed that evidence and then failed to correct Mr. Sneed's perjured denial, just as it suppressed evidence that in the middle of trial, in violation of the court's sequestration order, Sneed altered his testimony about the knife wounds on the victim at the urgent request of the prosecutor, who then falsely denied to the court her prior knowledge. There is no adequate or independent jurisdictional bar to review and no warrant for an evidentiary hearing. As to independence, the court's opinion is suffused with merits determinations on the Brady and Napue claims. And, certainly, there is no \"clear and express statement\" that the court's decision is based on a bona fide separate, adequate, and independent grounds, as long required by this Court to preclude review. Nor is there any adequate bar. By rejecting the State's waiver, the court created a jurisdictional threshold it had never applied in any other case. The disposition was \"without support in prior state law,\" as required by over 60 years of this Court's precedent to establish adequacy. No evidentiary hearing could alter the conclusion that Mr. Glossip was denied due process. There's no dispute that, contrary to Sneed's sworn testimony, the State's own suppressed record shows that he was, in fact, treated by a psychiatrist for bipolar disorder, just as there is no dispute that Sneed changed his testimony about the knife at the  urgent mid-trial request of the prosecutor, who then falsely denied that very fact to the court.

The plaintiffs claimed they worked about 60 hours per week, paid on commission without overtime compensation.\nThe sales representatives were assigned routes of stores, spending most of their time servicing chain stores and some independent groceries. Their duties included restocking shelves, managing inventory, and submitting orders for EMD products. While they could make some sales to independent stores, their ability to make sales at chain stores was limited, as high-level negotiations between EMD management and corporate buyers typically determined product placement. EMD argued that the sales representatives were exempt from overtime pay under the FLSA's \"outside sales\" exemption. The case went to a bench trial, where the court had to determine whether the plaintiffs' primary duty was making sales, qualifying them for the exemption, or if their work was primarily incidental to sales made by others. The district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, finding that EMD failed to prove the outside sales exemption applied, awarded both unpaid overtime wages and liquidated damages, but limited the damages to a two-year period after concluding that EMD's violation was not willful.

Respondent  --Respondents argue that a heightened standard is appropriate because FLSA rights are important. But a preponderance standard applies to rights against race discrimination and disability discrimination and rights to organize and to workplace safety, all super-important rights. This Court has reserved the clear and convincing standard to deprivations by the government of critical rights that don't involve money damages.

The plaintiffs claimed they worked about 60 hours per week, paid on commission without overtime compensation.\nThe sales representatives were assigned routes of stores, spending most of their time servicing chain stores and some independent groceries. Their duties included restocking shelves, managing inventory, and submitting orders for EMD products. While they could make some sales to independent stores, their ability to make sales at chain stores was limited, as high-level negotiations between EMD management and corporate buyers typically determined product placement. EMD argued that the sales representatives were exempt from overtime pay under the FLSA's \"outside sales\" exemption. The case went to a bench trial, where the court had to determine whether the plaintiffs' primary duty was making sales, qualifying them for the exemption, or if their work was primarily incidental to sales made by others. The district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, finding that EMD failed to prove the outside sales exemption applied, awarded both unpaid overtime wages and liquidated damages, but limited the damages to a two-year period after concluding that EMD's violation was not willful. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.\n\nLEGAL_QUESTION:\nIs the burden of proof that employers must satisfy to demonstrate the applicability of a Fair Labor Standards Act exemption a mere preponderance of the evidence or clear and convincing evidence?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>justice_john_g_roberts_jr<|end_header_id|>\n\n We'll hear argument next in Case 23-217, E.M.D. Sales versus Carrera.

That default rule should resolve this case. Nothing in the text suggests that Congress intended a clear and convincing evidence standard to apply to the 34 exemptions under the Fair Labor Standard  -- Fair Labor Standards Act. Respondent  --Respondents argue that a heightened standard is appropriate because FLSA rights are important. But a preponderance standard applies to rights against race discrimination and disability discrimination and rights to organize and to workplace safety, all super-important rights. This Court has reserved the clear and convincing standard to deprivations by the government of critical rights that don't involve money damages. This Court has never allowed plaintiffs to use a clear and convincing  standard as a sword, and it certainly has never read a clear and convincing standard into a statute for money damages. Respondents also argue that overtime rights aren't waivable. But waivability and standards of proof are unrelated and don't go hand in hand. Waivability goes to who owns the right, the government or the individual, and the standard of proof goes to how hard it is to prove that the right attaches in the first place. Thus, the preponderance of the evidence standard governs non-waivable rights, such as those under the NLRA and OSHA, and heightened standards govern waivable rights, such as those in criminal trials and deportation hearings.

The plaintiffs claimed they worked about 60 hours per week, paid on commission without overtime compensation.\nThe sales representatives were assigned routes of stores, spending most of their time servicing chain stores and some independent groceries. Their duties included restocking shelves, managing inventory, and submitting orders for EMD products. While they could make some sales to independent stores, their ability to make sales at chain stores was limited, as high-level negotiations between EMD management and corporate buyers typically determined product placement. EMD argued that the sales representatives were exempt from overtime pay under the FLSA's \"outside sales\" exemption. The case went to a bench trial, where the court had to determine whether the plaintiffs' primary duty was making sales, qualifying them for the exemption, or if their work was primarily incidental to sales made by others. The district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, finding that EMD failed to prove the outside sales exemption applied, awarded both unpaid overtime wages and liquidated damages, but limited the damages to a two-year period after concluding that EMD's violation was not willful.
